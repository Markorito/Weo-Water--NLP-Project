Some teenagers and young adults who received Covid vaccines experienced heart inflammation, a US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advisory group said, recommending further study of the rare condition. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices in a statement dated May 17 said it had looked into reports that a few young vaccine recipients - predominantly male, adolescents and young adults - developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. The condition often goes away without complications and can be caused by a variety of viruses, the CDC group said. CDC monitoring systems had not found more cases than would be expected in the population, but members of the committee on vaccinations felt that healthcare providers should be made aware of the reports of the ""potential adverse event"", the committee said. It did not say how many people had been affected and recommended further investigation. Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, said vaccines are known to cause myocarditis and it would be important to monitor to see if it is causally related to the vaccine. It is important to look at the risk-benefit ratio, he said: ""Vaccines are going to unequivocally be much more beneficial outweighing this very low, if conclusively established, risk."" The CDC said the cases typically occurred within four days after receiving the mRNA vaccines. It did not specify which vaccines. The United States has given emergency authorisation to two mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Israel's Health Ministry in April said it was examining a small number of cases of heart inflammation in people who had received Pfizer's vaccine, although it had not yet drawn any conclusions. Most of the cases in Israel were reported among people up to age 30. Pfizer at the time said it had not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be the case in the general population and that a causal link to the vaccine had not been established. Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The CDC in late April, after news of the Israeli investigation, said it did not see a link between the two. Earlier this month US regulators expanded authorisation of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine to children aged 12 to 15.",2021-05-18 03:20:37+00:00,"['vaccine', 'captures', 'devastating', 'brazil', 'cdc', 'floods', 'drone', 'pfizer', 'committee', 'cases', 'young', 'vaccines', 'condition', 'inflammation', 'heart']",Brazil,news article,English
919,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Health Canada warns mould is a serious concern in flood-hit homes - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/health-canada-warns-mould-is-a-serious-concern-in-flood-hit-homes-1.4405421,"Health Canada is warning of the dangers of mould in homes and cottages hit by this year's spring flooding.

Federal biologist Francis Lavoie says it's important to dry wet walls and belongings within 48 hours, but that's not always possible in the case of flooding.

""You need to remove anything that has been too wet for too long that's not dryable,"" he said.

""Cushions, carpet, drywall, mattresses, box springs, stuffed toys, insulation material -- everything that has been exposed to water and cannot be dried -- needs to be thrown away or discarded.""

He said plastic toys and some furniture can be cleaned up if it is just surface mould.

Lavoie said often by the time people can get back into their homes, mould is already growing.

""Mould is the most common indoor air contaminant in Canada.""

He said people in homes with mould are more likely to have eye, nose and throat irritations, coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.

Lavoie said it's important a cleanup be thorough, because water can seep under floors and into walls.

""We usually recommend using professionals for such extensive work. In the case of a flood, it's a lot of clean-up,"" he said.

For those doing their own clean-up, Health Canada does not recommend using bleach. Instead it says dish soap or spray soaps work just as well to clean up mould, and don't have the kind of strong vapours that can burn your eyes or irritate your throat.

The Canadian Red Cross is distributing free clean-up kits to homeowners affected by flooding.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health, said anyone doing their own clean-up needs to take proper precautions.

""Wear rubber boots, gloves, eye protection and a face mask when cleaning and disinfecting. Always wash hands with soap and clean water after clean-up activities even if wearing gloves,"" she said.

Russell recommends having wells tested if they may have been impacted by floodwaters.

Lavoie said homeowners should not drop their guard even long after the clean-up has been done.

""Keep an eye on the rooms where there was mould. If you see that it is coming back, that may mean it wasn't cleaned up properly,"" he said.

Lavoie said many of the health symptoms related to mould are similar to those of allergies, so people can often ignore them if they believe they're just the result of pollen or other springtime allergens.

Changes in summer flooding of the Nile are driven by volcanoes as far away as Iceland.

Sedeer El-Showk

Ancient natural changes, or man-made ones, can affect modern man today, researchers say.

© Getty Images In 2010, the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland grounded flights to and from Europe, causing the largest air-traffic disruption since World War II. Now, a new study shows that violent volcanic eruptions in Iceland and elsewhere led to social and political unrest in ancient Egypt by disrupting the regular flooding of the Nile on which agriculture depended.

In addition to shedding light on Egyptian history, the findings highlight the value of socio-ecological framework in understanding history.

The analysis started with data from the Islamic Nilometer, an annual hydrological meter tracking Nile flood levels as far back as 622 CE. The team correlated Nilometer records from 622 until 1902, when the Aswan Low Dam was completed, with evidence from ice cores showing when volcanic eruptions had occurred.

“It’s only since 2015 that the ice core data has been precise enough to give us dates for these events with an error of about one year instead of plus-or-minus ten years by the time we get back to the Ancient period,” says Francis Ludlow, a historical climatologist at Trinity College Dublin who was one of the lead authors of the study.

With the more precise data, the team discovered a link between volcanic eruptions and the extent of Nile flooding.

Explosive eruptions launch sulphurous gases into the atmosphere which become aerosols and reflect away sunlight, decreasing average global rainfall and temperatures. The cooling effect of eruptions that occur at high latitudes, such as in Iceland, is concentrated in the northern hemisphere. This imbalance causes a shift in monsoons, which fail to migrate as far northwards as normal.

Regions such as Ethiopia see a major drop in rainfall normally brought by the monsoon winds, leading to a drop in the level of the Nile’s summer flood, supplied mainly from the Blue Nile arising in the Ethiopian Highlands.

“We moderns tend to think we are exempted from natural changes, or man-made ones. But we are not.""

According to the analysis, an average drop of 22 cm occurred in eruption years, with the drop increasing as the analysis was restricted to larger and larger eruptions. The reduction would have been devastating for farmers, who weren’t able to carry or pump enough water for irrigation and so relied on Nile flooding to water their crops.

“Depending on how flat your land on either side of the Nile was, it could mean the difference between having a crop or having no crop,” says Ludlow.

Next, the team turned to Ptolemaic Egypt, a period with less thorough records of Nile flooding levels but rich in other historical documents.

By combining information from these documents with ice core data about volcanic eruptions, they showed that periods of social unrest coincided with eruption years.

Tax records and land ownership records revealed that uprisings against the rule of the Ptolemies were more common during and shortly after eruptions, when the researchers predict flooding levels would have been lower.

Ludlow emphasizes the value of tracking the ownership of land, which ancient Egyptians kept within a family for generations. The sale of land outside of families significantly increased after eruptions, which Ludlow calls “a real reflection of the stress in society.”

Volcanic disruptions of the Nile’s activity were also linked with how the Ptolemies dealt with their neighbours. Around 245 BCE, Ptolemy III abruptly abandoned a successful military campaign against the kingdom’s rival, the Seleucid Empire. This about-face “changed everything about Near-Eastern history,” says Joseph Manning, a Yale University historian who co-led the study.

Manning and Ludlow’s findings lend credence to the theory that Ptolemy abandoned the war because he had to deal with disturbances in Egypt.

The team believe that major eruptions in 247 and 244 BCE led to a failure of Nile flooding which incited domestic unrest.

Their analysis showed that volcanic eruptions throughout the Ptolemaic period correlated with the end of military campaigns but not their start, suggesting that unrest linked with the eruptions may have limited the Ptolemies’ ability to continue prosecuting expensive wars abroad.

However, while the study shows a clear influence of volcano-related climatic disruptions on the course of Ptolemaic Egypt’s history, the researchers stress that many other factors were also at play, with Nile flooding interacting with and amplifying other stressors.

The findings also have implications for contemporary societies. For example, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is expected to dramatically alter hydro-politics in the region, will be affected. However, the researchers raise the concern of a possible impact of volcanic eruptions on water availability, which could add stress to an already sensitive situation.

“We moderns tend to think we are exempted from natural changes, or man-made ones. But we are not,"" says Manning.

Next, the team plans to turn their attention to other ancient civilizations, such as Chinese dynasties and Babylon, where excellent records of the level of the Euphrates were kept for centuries.

In addition to revealing how climatic factors affected the history of these societies, the analysis also serves as “a tool to investigate the relative vulnerability of different social and agricultural systems globally,” says Ludlow.

“I’m hoping to see which societies were more vulnerable and which were more resilient and then follow up by examining the context of these differences. Was their agriculture different? Was their political setup different?”

According to Manning, there’s still “a long way to go in understanding how to deeply integrate climate change into historical analysis.”",2017-10-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['records', 'researchers', 'volcanic', 'eruptions', 'analysis', 'flooding', 'nile', 'team', 'land', 'history']",Egypt,news article,English

401,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) (February 2021) - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-joint-market-monitoring-initiative-jmmi-february-2021,"INTRODUCTION

The humanitarian response system in Somalia has mechanisms in place for rapid scale-up and sustained programming, including cash and voucher assistance (CVA). Despite the challenging context of COVID-19, 224.8 million USD was dispursed through CVA in Somalia by the end of November 2020. The use of CVA, through multi-purpose cash assistance and sectoral cash, is expected to rise throughout 2021, as it remains an effective means of delivering aid. .

The Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) is a joint initiative from the Somalia Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Shelter, and Education clusters and REACH. It aims to address an information gap in Somalia in terms of regular and updated monitoring of market functionality and a broad range of non-food items (NFIs), while contributing to existing supply chain and price monitoring of the main minimum expenditure basket (MEB) items.

The aim of the JMMI is to harmonize market monitoring, avoid duplications and overlaps in data collection, maximize geographic coverage and ensure a regular and predictable output to inform cluster programming and cash responses. It is a model that REACH has supported to set up and coordinate in several countries.

The assessed items are selected based on needs of the three clusters and their members, currently implementing or planning to implement MarketBased Programming (MBP) and CVA. On the supply side, MBP supports traders to expand their products, for example through providing non-refundable cash grants for business development. On the demand side, CVA is provided to increase access to WASH, shelter, and education commodities.

Data collection takes place on a quarterly basis.

The pilot round of the JMMI in Somalia took place in June 2020, in 6 locations with a reduced list of assessed items. The August 2020 round was the first full round of the JMMI, which covered more than 50 items from the WASH and Shelter clusters, in 12 different locations. Atypical circumstances due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have increased both the demand for an updated monitoring of a broad range of NFIs, and the limitations faced when collecting primary data.

Twenty additional items were added to the JMMI in November 2020, in collaboration with the Somalia Education Cluster, to respond to persisting information gaps on education-related expenses.

As of the most recent round in February 2021, the JMMI continues to grow and improve, with partners working together, learning from experience, while delivering the best possible data with transparency and accuracy",2021-04-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['shelter', 'items', 'initiative', '2020', 'joint', 'jmmi', 'wash', 'monitoring', 'cva', 'market', 'round', 'cash', '2021', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English
557,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,"Ghana is trying to drop its IMF, World Bank debt habit - Quartz",https://qz.com/africa/1660942/ghana-is-trying-to-drop-its-imf-world-bank-debt-habit/,"The relationship between Ghana and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is, to many Ghanaians, a difficult one. Most Ghanaians are of the view that the country should divorce itself from the international body.

A look at sentiments expressed in statements by former presidents and finance ministers under whose tenure the country exited one sponsored programme or another illustrate this well. They ranged from:

The decision to be independent of IMF budgetary support is a watershed in the history of the country’s economic development.

to

We won’t go to IMF again; Ghana will no longer be troubled by conditionalities of IMF.

These quotes encapsulate how Ghanaians feel about the relationship. But is the relationship that bad? An informed assessment requires some context: how Ghana relates to all Bretton Woods institutions. A historical assessment of this will better contextualise the nature of Ghana’s relationship with the IMF.

The early years

Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence in 1957. It was undoubtedly a beacon of hope for the region. The country had significant natural resources as well as a highly educated population.

Ghana’s relationship with the IMF is a cycle of meeting targets under its programs before falling back on bad habits.

The relationship between Ghana and the IMF and World Bank dates back to the late 1960s. Following the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah’s government in 1966, the country suffered nearly two decades of political instability and economic decline. A prolonged drought worsened the situation, as did widespread bush fires. This resulted in an unparalleled famine. Adding to the burden on government was the need to resettle one million citizens from Nigeria. The next decade saw the global oil crisis as well as a persistent downward trend in the terms of trade. By the 1980s inflation was at a triple digit level. Undoubtedly, by 1983, Ghana’s economy was in tatters. It desperately needed support to reverse the downward spiral. As a result, Ghana embarked on a major programme of economic reform. It did this through an IMF and World Bank sponsored structural adjustment programme and economic recovery programme.

Over the years these have become a major reference points in terms of the relationship between Ghana and the Bretton Woods institutions.

The scale of reforms under these arrangements were enormous.

Structural adjustment

The structural adjustment facilities were used to steer Ghana toward becoming a market friendly nation where incentives were created by the free market. In the process, the country embarked on a large-scale overhaul of institutions, encouraged competition by privatising state own enterprises, built institutional capacity and attained macroeconomic stability.

Undeniably Ghana chalked up some initial successes under the programme. It was in fact referred to as the programme’s ideal student due to significant improvements in its macroeconomic indicators.

But after nearly two decades of adjustment, in 2001, the country fell on hard times. It was classified as a highly indebted poor country – a World Bank and IMF initiative aimed at reducing the external debt burden of very poor countries.

At the time, all Ghana’s earlier successes had been eroded. The economy was suffering from rapid exchange rate depreciation, high inflation and very low external reserves. The severe crisis was partly due to high debt service requirements that affected the budget and affected the balance of payments.

In 2001, the newly elected government opted for debt relief under the highly indebted countries initiative. This decision was met with a lot of public backlash. People’s view was that Ghana had fallen from being the beacon of hope for Africa to being heavily indebted and poor.

People started to ask lots of questions about the implications of the effects of 16 years of IMF and World Bank adjustment programmes, and their ramifications on Ghana’s development. To many, the country had been tied to the apron strings of the Bretton Woods institutions and had to wean itself off as soon as possible.

Again, by mid-2013, the government’s efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation were undermined by policy slippages, external shocks and rising interest cost. This continued until mid-2014. But then the country’s net international reserves position had weakened further. And the exchange rate had depreciated sharply, fuelling inflationary pressures.

These macroeconomic mishaps occurred against the background of the issuance of Eurobond and a short-term loan contracted by the Cocoa Board in the same year. Yet public debt continued to rise at an unsustainable pace.

Ghana then entered another IMF-backed stabilisation program, its 16th since independence, after missing targets in 2013 and 2014. On 3 April 2015, the IMF approved a three-year Extended Credit Facility arrangement with Ghana. This was aimed at the restoration of debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability to foster a return to high growth and job creation while protecting social spending. The programme was extended for an additional year, ending on 2 April 2019.

Undoubtedly, the programme resulted in significant macroeconomic gains with rising growth, single digit inflation, fiscal consolidation and banking sector clean-up. Nevertheless, challenges remain.

Ghana performs again

In its World Economic Outlook the IMF is forecasting that Ghana will be the fastest growing economy in the world this year with a projected growth rate of 8.8%. As with previous IMF/World Bank sponsored programmes, Ghana is once again out-performing itself.

As usual, the government is very optimistic about the prospects of the country following its exit from the programme. The obvious question being asked is: what is different this time?

The programme appears different in a number of ways.

First, it was based on a combination (domestic and foreign) of sources of finance. Second, conditionalities attached to it were informed by homegrown policies. This was unlike previous programmes where conditionalities were based on the Washington consensus.

Lastly, Ghana has also made important changes. It passed a new law – the first of its kind in the country – to govern government spending. The Act seeks to ensure fiscal responsibility, macroeconomic stability, and debt sustainability. A key provision gives parliament the power to censure the Finance Minister if spending exceeds defined limits.

What next?

Given the chronology of Ghana’s relationship with the IMF – and the cycle of achieving targets under its programmes before falling back on bad habits – most believe it’s just a matter of time before the country goes back to the IMF asking for help. The likelihood of this happening is increased by the fact that the country goes to the polls in 2020. This means there is bound to be a tendency for government to overspend.

Whatever happens next, it’s important to note that the structure of the economy has not changed. It is still highly susceptible to external shocks, particularly commodity prices. To the extent that these external shocks are unavoidable, the IMF and World Bank will remain critical partners in the country’s development process.

1212,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Climate Change in Nigeria: Floods in Lagos, Abuja, Niger Delta are going to get a lot worse - Quartz Africa",https://qz.com/africa/1054825/climate-change-in-nigeria-floods-in-lagos-abuja-niger-delta-are-going-to-get-a-lot-worse/,"Earlier this year heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos, Nigerias economic nerve centre and one of Africas most populous cities. Residents woke up in many parts of the city to find their streets and homes flooded and their property, including cars and other valuables, submerged.

Pictures and videos later posted online showed dramatic and even bizarre scenes of flooding in the city, including the capture of a crocodile in the floodwater. Another video, which went viral, was one of a man kayaking in floodwater on one of the streets.

Lagos has not been alone. Suleija, a town near the capital city Abuja hundreds of kilometres away, suffered its own flooding challenge in early July. Heavy rains washed houses away and caused others to collapse, trapping occupants. Thirteen people were reported to have died.

The two primary factors of flooding in Nigeria are climate change and poor urban planning.

Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigerias 36 states were affected, 24 severely. More than 360 people were killed and almost two million people were displaced.

The seriousness of the flooding was attributed to a combination of two events: very heavy local rainfall and the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in nearby Cameroon.

Although the degree and seriousness of flooding in Nigeria fluctuates, flooding remains a recurring phenomenon in most parts of the country. The first factor aggravating flooding is climate change, which has been shown to contribute to more extreme storms and rainfall. Another factor contributing to flooding in cities is that Nigeria has experienced rapid urban growth and planning is poor.

The problem of flooding is not peculiar to Nigeria alone. In 2007, floods affected 1.5 million people across several countries in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Niger. Alluvial flooding is common for major riverssuch as Nile, Niger, Benue, Orange, Zambeziin Africa. Major cities in Africa are also susceptible to fluvial flooding which occurs when excessive rainfall, over an extended period of time, causes rivers to overflow.

Why Nigeria suffers

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria (1978 to 2007) suggests that rainstorms are getting more intense. The data show that there are fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed much from previous decades. This means that more rain is falling on the days that there is rain, which in turn means that rain storms in the city are getting more intense, increasing the threat of flooding.

Rainfall patterns in Nigeria suggests rainstorms are getting more intense with fewer rainy days, yet the total yearly amounts of rainfall have not changed.

In addition to more intense rain storms, the other possible cause of flooding in coastal regions is rising sea levels. Although up-to-date data on the rising sea levels in Nigeria are scarce, its believed that if nothing is done, this is likely to aggravate flooding in the future, particularly in coastal cities.

Areas at risk include Lagos, which is on the coast, as well as the Niger Delta region which has many low-lying towns and villages. Being on the coast also makes these places more susceptible to storm surges. While these areas are no stranger to floods, evidence suggests that floods have become increasingly common and intense in recent times.

In the northern parts of the country, heavy rains are likely to cause rivers to overflow their banks and cause flooding in the adjoining states. The changes in rainfall patterns, particularly in frequency and intensity, have meant that these events have begun to happen more frequently.

In Nigerias cities, the most common cause of flooding after excessive rains is poor drainage systems that cant cope. This is called pluvial flooding. Lagos provides a good case study.

Lagos as a case study

Lagos has been urbanizing rapidly. By some estimates there will be 19 million in the city by 2050, making it the 11th most populous city in the world. It is also home to most of the countrys industrial, commercial and non-oil operations.

Urbanisation and industrialisation increase the number of roads and buildings. This in turn increases the proportion of surface area where water cannot be absorbed into the ground, leading to rapid runoff which then causes flooding during storms. And in cities that manage their infrastructure well, storm water drainage systems are built so that water can be directed to rivers efficiently and quickly.

Lagos has not kept up with its infrastructure needs. The growth and expansion of the city has been largely unregulated. The has resulted in inadequate and poor housing, the development of slum areas and inadequate water supply and waste disposal, among other problems.

Whats complicated the situation for Lagos is that many parts of the city were originally low-lying mangrove swamps and wetlands, which have been reclaimed and settled, mostly by poorer communities and more recently through concerted efforts by the government.

These low-lying areas are particularly at risk of flooding, and the situation is complicated by buildings being constructed on water ways, and bad waste dumping habits which block the drains.

Up to 70% of the population of Lagos live in slums.

What must be done

Its clear Nigeria needs to take measures to cope with flooding. This will require both local and international interventions, and could include early warning and rapid response systems, flood data gathering and modelling, proper urban and spatial planning, flood emergency preparedness and political will.

The country can learn from others. For example, in Mumbai, India various measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of flooding. These have included an emergency control centre, automated weather stations, removal of solid waste from stormwater drains and the development of emergency response mechanisms. Nigeria must invest in these measures, and sustain them.

In March 2019, the Tropical Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete, displacing more than 140,000 people; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port City of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow and leaving people stranded on trees and houses.

On 25 April, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in Cabo Delgado province just six weeks after Idai and was the first cyclone to make landfall this far north in Mozambique. Entire villages were flattened and thousands of people were displaced, in a country already dealing with the consequences of drought and Cyclone Idai.

Humanitarian actors have scaled-up operations, in support of the Government-led response. However, people are still in need of vital assistance and more funding is urgently required.",2019-05-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['tropical', 'mozambique', 'weeks', 'idai', 'cyclone', 'kenneth', 'cyclones', 'system', '2019', '22', 'weather', 'landfall', 'zambezia']",Mozambique,news article,English

(Photo courtesy of UNDP)

The skinny woman trembled, seemingly unable to stand still because of her happiness to receive a house thanks to the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Vietnam and local peoples generosity.Luu Thi Phuong, 56, in Que Thuan Commune, Que Son District, Quang Nam Province, saw her house destroyed by a storm in October 2020.She was one of the thousands of people who lost nearly all of their assets due to the storms of 2020 in central Vietnam.Her husband died when she gave birth to her fourth child 16 years ago, so Phuong alone raised her four small children.Life is so hard. I work alone in the field as a hired labourer to support these children, she said.Now, her two eldest daughters have their own families and work in a local factory. However, her two sons have health problems, so they still live at home and can only work as hired labourers around the commune.In the new two-storey house, she reserved the most solemn area on the second floor as an altar for her husband. On the first floor, she presented a set of wooden tables and chairs bought from money saved by children.I give my thanks to the UNDP, the provincial People's Committee and the Red Cross. Without this support, I don't know when we would have been able to build such a house,"" she said.""I will pick up local neighbours to live at my house if there are floods and storms in this area,"" she added.The house with a ground area of 16sq.m and worth 110 million VND (5,000 USD) was one of more than 430 storm-resistant houses provided by the UNDP in five provinces in central Vietnam.This assistance activity is part of the project 'Responding to natural disasters in Vietnam' funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).At the end of April, the UNDP handed over 10 houses to people in Quang Nam Province as part of the UNDPs 2021 plan to build flood-resistant houses.In addition to building more than 430 new houses, the UNDP in collaboration with the People's Committees of central provinces that suffered heavy damage in the storms last October (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai) and the Red Cross completed the repairs and reinforcement of more than 3,300 damaged houses.Some 3,300 household kits have also been provided to poor households. Household items, including kitchen equipment, blankets, curtains, personal protective equipment, and chemical disinfectants were all necessary for people to get back on their feet.UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Caitlin Wiesen, said that more than ever, affected people, especially the poor, women and girls were in need of safe houses and essential items to deal with the damage.Our safe homes have saved thousands of people during the historic floods and storms that devastated central Vietnam, she said.However, there is still a long way forward to be able to assist those in need of safe homes.Tran Van Tan, Deputy Chairman of the Quang Nam Provincial People's Committee, said there were still many poor households, lonely mothers and disabled people suffering difficulties in life and some had lost their homes in last years floods.""This makes the poor, who already struggle so much, in even greater difficulties without community support.Tan said the local authorities appreciated the UNDP's efforts and timely support to build and repair the houses.It is very practical and meaningful support for local people. We hope to continue to receive this support so that people living in areas affected by storms and floods have a warmer life, he said.At a house handover ceremony at Que Thuan Commune last week, Nguyen Van Tien, Deputy Chief of the Standing Office of the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention and Control, said: I appreciate the co-ordination of UNDP that help people in the disaster area.""This assistance not only solves immediate post-disaster recovery but is also sustainable for local residents living in frequent disaster areas such as central Vietnam.""The UNDP is also organising a crowdfunding campaign titled 'Safe House, Peace of Life' to support the construction of 100 new safe houses in vulnerable locations in Quang Binh Province and further construction of safe houses in Que Son District, (Quang Nam Province) and Ly Son island district (Quang Ngai Province).In particular, our safe homes in Ly Son Island will have a new design and enhanced resistance to special wind conditions, and rooftop solar systems are capable of providing sufficient lighting systems for households, said Wiesen.Central Vietnam was battered by strong storms and floods last October. According to the Central Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention, more than 230 people were killed or went missing. At least 380,000 houses were flooded, damaged or collapsed./.",2021-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodhit', 'vietnam', 'receive', 'storms', 'nam', 'quang', 'residents', 'undp', 'nams', 'central', 'support', 'house', 'houses', 'safe']",Vietnam,news article,English

2.5 million people in need (HRP, August 2019)

6 provinces affected

1.6 million people in need of food assistance (IPC, July 2019)

2.3 million Cyclone and flood affected people assisted (WFP, since March 2019)

Highlights

• For implementing recovery interventions in Cyclone and drought-affected areas from October 2019 to March 2020, which corresponds to the next harvest season, WFP’s net funding requirements stand at USD 97 million.

Situation Update

• According to the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) results released in July 2019, it is estimated that 1.6 million people are currently facing difficulties in accessing food to meet acceptable food needs (April – September 2019). Of the 39 districts analyzed using IPC, it is estimated that from October 2019, at least 12 districts require a combination of urgent interventions such as food assistance, agricultural inputs, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood support. It is projected that the food insecurity and acute malnutrition situation will prevail until the end of February 2020, when the next harvest is expected to start. Humanitarian assistance already provided in the most affected areas has prevented the deterioration of the food security situation. In addition, approximately 67,500 children under five years of age need treatment for acute malnutrition.

• As of 31 July, the emergency phase of the Cyclone response was finalized. WFP is currently transitioning to the recovery and resilience phase that will support Cyclone affected populations until March-April 2020 (next harvest).

• WFP has designed a three-phase post-Cyclone recovery and resilience strategy aiming to support recovery, reconstruction and resilience- strengthening efforts among the affected communities. The first phase of implementation is a 3-month Post-Emergency Recovery programme started in August. Unconditional assistance will continue to be provided to those most in need.",2019-08-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'cyclone', 'brief', 'affected', '2019', 'wfp', 'food', 'assistance', 'recovery', 'million', 'country', 'phase', 'need']",Mozambique,news article,English

Therefore, the students do not only memorize the teaching materials they have received, she said.The quality of direct learning at campus may get lowered due to online learning. However, the phenomenon does not happen at her college. The learning quality does not change though an online learning method is applied, she pointed out.White, UTS Deputy Head – Students and Subjects Faculty of Business, noted that the most important point is to trigger the students to study together in fun ways. Moreover, the lessons learned will match to jobs they aspire.Thus, both lecturers and students necessitate to discuss about current issues that will lead them to identify and create their contribution to business sector and local communities.Previously, UniSadhuGuna International College (UIC College) under PT UniSadhuGuna along with global partner, UTS College held a workshop on topic “Understand What Are Employers Seeking and How to Keep Building Career Readiness During this Uncertain Time”.Head of UniSadhuGuna at the Pondok Indah Campus, Yani Oktaviana, said that the discussion was aimed at giving the students the exposure and insight to face the unpredictable changes. In addition, it offers the solutions on how to become qualified human resources and make changes to be ready to work in any industrial sector.Oktaviana added that this fast changing world needs to be well-adapted. Therefore, conducting some trainings for students is important to give them exposure and insight in line with global issues.“As one of the educational institutions, we want to focus on preparing future leaders during the study period until they have to plough through the real world, career world,” she pointed out.",2021-04-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['lecturers', 'change', 'expert', 'online', 'need', 'students', 'pointed', 'world', 'unisadhuguna', 'learning', 'assessment', 'uts', 'methods', 'teaching', 'college']",India,news article,English

Agata, from Khadundu village in western Kenyaâ??s Busia county, has been living in a temporary camp for displaced families for at least three weeks.

â??The water came and swept away our houses and everything we owned; we came here with nothing. We are in great need of assistance, especially food,â? Agata said, as she prepared a meal for her grandchildren.

Floods and landslides have killed at least 194 people in the East African country and displaced 100,000, the government said earlier this month. The region is also being ravaged by an invasion of locusts.

Lake Victoria, on Kenyaâ??s southern border, has washed over farmland and houses. Scientists say it hasnâ??t been this high since 1964.

The shoreline has crept forward 10 km, local official Casper Ajuma told Reuters.

â??Now we donâ??t have anywhere to farm, we donâ??t have anywhere to build our houses,â? he said.

1249,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"As Pakistan glacier melt surges, efforts to cut flood risk drag - Reuters",https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN23F03B,"ISLAMABAD (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistans mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet from my familys home. We evacuated, said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

The flood water broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village, Qadir told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.

Now there is a ravine right next to our houses and we live in dread of another flood.

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners - the U.N. Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change - as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with an aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistans assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now up and running.

MELTING GLACIERS

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream, in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the U.N. Adaptation Fund from 2011-2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan, and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

DANGER AHEAD

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that June to September will be dangerous, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier on a helicopter recently for a look, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistans Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier and there was talk of an (automated) early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken, he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system cant come soon enough, as summer heat raises the threat level.

We dont care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system, Qadir said.

This coming summer there will be more flooding and people will suffer.",2020-06-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['warning', 'cut', 'surges', 'climate', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'change', 'village', 'efforts', 'outburst', 'flood', 'drag', 'walls', 'early', 'melt', 'systems', 'risk']",Pakistan,news article,English

703,Drought Sri Lanka,TransConflict » More new writing from Serbia – post-modern excavations of the common life - TransConflict,http://www.transconflict.com/2012/11/more-new-writing-from-serbia-post-modern-excavations-of-the-common-life-271/,"Three new pieces of writing from Serbia take up and engage significant omissions in official history and public discourse – among them the homegrown democracy of the prosaic, the local and the pastoral interrupted by conflict, and death under uncompromising centralization and endless transition to nowhere.

By Norman Wacker

“Next Friday,” I say, “and for your homework, write out a conversation with your best friend in Cyrillic.” “My best friend is in Osijek,” – “Learning Cyrillic”, David Albahari.

Clearly they make now no distinction, where a life is concerned between a provincial merchant and his wife, between a village priest (which is what my great grandfather was) and a village bell ringer called Ćuk, whose name also figures in the book. The only condition – something I grasped at once, it seems to have come to me even before I could confirm it – for inclusion in the Encyclopedia of the Dead is that no one whose name is recorded here may appear in any other encyclopedia – “Encyclopedia of the Dead,” Danilo Kiš.

You can only recognize a gift by its effects, by what it leaves behind – Farewell Gift, Vladimir Tasić.

We (and this “we” I take to be universal – the club of victims and perpetrators is far from exclusive, or for that matter mutually exclusive) who have endured divorce, defeat, loss of a sibling, child or parent, suffered the earthquakes enfolded in the euphemism “regime change,” who have fouled precious goods or had them befouled, know how dogged are the intrusions of past losses and indiscretions ignored, concealed or gone otherwise unacknowledged. Formidable barricades of plausible and implausible denial, self-censorship and official silence, even seemingly vast stretches of successful forgetting, are breached during our dreams, our interludes of intoxication, and our bouts of homesickness. Our soiled pasts can be resurrected against our wishes by incidental references or lapses of vigilance, opening unsolicited floods of memory and heightening the guilty impulse to doctor, deny or erase again the loss, humiliation or guilt. Denial and forgetting defend against loss that acknowledged would unravel the fabric of who we once hoped to be and the place we hoped to secure in family, community, or the grandiose future legacies and riches, those treasured effects we would leave to posterity.

Three new releases in the Belgrade publishing house Geo Poetika’s Serbian Prose in Translation series, as varied as they are stylistically and with respect to setting, take-up a common thread, narratives of personal and collective loss that require active recall and reconstruction, which excavate the collective waste of humanity and community that accompanied the destruction of common life during the age of the Yugoslav conflict and since in its successor state, Serbia. That interruption of the families, educations, careers, places and countries of residence of those who lived in the region, serves as a kind of muted wall paper against which these narratives – whether monologue, meta-fictional collage, melodrama or cheeky documentary – narrate lives and times unravelled. Against this background, these writers construct truncated and fragmented narratives of recall and return against the grain of forgetting and erasure. They depict a kind of stasis and stagnation that holds up the mirror to life in a post-conflict society in which heady infusions of global marketing, high-end retail destinations, kafana culture escapism and bouts of ultranationalist muscle flexing, poorly conceal that the post-conflict “transformation” has proven protracted, disappointing or, with respect to its fondest and maddest hopes, gone altogether unrealized. Pensioners, unhappily expatriated mid-lifers at their teaching, sky cap and IT development posts abroad, cardiac patients and lives otherwise conducted at the very tip of the furthest branches of family trees uprooted, act as the protagonists of this post-Yugoslav archipelago, that seem to be interesting varieties of Penelope (and/or Ulysses) embattled whether in their over-run homes or while at sea. Ulysses it seems may have never survived, as rumour insisted, his conscription and deployment to battle at Vukovar, or escaped his drug-addled becalming in New York or Belgrade’s crisis era all-night party scene to realize his long entertained return. He may have only inwardly migrated to New Belgrade or crossed the seas to Manitoba, or never left home at all (like the Serbian Leopold and Molly) or long since established a new home and hearth elsewhere without a forwarding address. The suitors remain largely off-stage here, their hegemony less obstructed by the witty un-designs of Penelope or the dreamlike promiscuity of Molly than their own truly Homeric bickering, contention and squandered chances without end.

The phantom limbs of former lifelines – the disappearance and the presumed, but un-consecrated deaths of identical twins, hero-worshipped siblings, first-born mail children, neighbours and childhood friends, the retreat of parents into dysfunction and silence – beset our narrator’s and their protagonists. Their resulting fictions amount to a narrative reconstruction of the most immediate intimate of personal and domestic ties, their destruction. The resulting narratives evoke collateral losses of community, vocation and personal integration once enjoyed by those phantom-like approximations of former selves who have survived into the post-conflict present. Together these fictions engage the persistent legacy of two decades of ruined reputation, economic stagnation, perceived victimization and betrayal that accompanied the Yugoslav conflict. They are voiced in various ways. They include an unbroken monologue saturated with rescued texts and episodes of the narrator’s missing sibling (Vladimir Tasić’s, Farewell Gift), composed of the discontinuous and interrupted coming of age of a speaker at once under construction and simultaneously deconstructing received ideas (Mića Vujičić’s, Tackling Foul) or in a darkly inconclusive post-modern script etched on official and elite discourse of convenience (Radivoj Šajtinac’s, Victims of Biedermeier). Together these works write in obverse on the ideological constructions that distanced Serbs in the homeland from events just beyond their borders, alienated them in the abroad-to-be from their neighbours and contributed to their expulsion from the republics and entities to come and their unsettling on foreign shores in large numbers. These fictions allow virtual reconstruction at a spatial and temporal distance of the continuity of past and present lives, one no longer conceivable in actuality – though discount air fares, Skype and Cyrillic lessons in Calgary and California sustain a parallel universe in which families and communities that live on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond pick up lost threads and tend to their mending. Grandiose official memorializing of course abounds throughout the new republics, while leaving the small scale work of invention, recovery and reclamation undone. These works navigate the complex hybrid of destruction and grandiose new orders and begin to assemble a textual and reflective record from pieces that remain of everyday lives and trajectories of history interrupted – an impetus to taking them up and examining to what extent we have known them well at all.

I recently visited the graves of relations in the municipality of Bor. We formed a small party and completed a midsummer cleaning and repair, brushing away drought-browned cypress needles, removing floral arrangements from a Spring visit, as our cousin-in-law renewed the gilt lettering on the black headstone and we left are usual mementoes of travels during our absence. A simple ritual of care, remembrance and small gifts, taking up the multi-generational conversation and web of memory which connects the lives of those born into and joined by marriage into a common constellation of being human for a time on earth. Adjoining graves of several generations were in varied states of neglect and maintenance. The most recent plots awaited a monument; other monuments memorialized a small nuclear family passed in its entirety; some listed the names of family members yet to join those already among the dead. Some were buried under the sign of the Yugoslav star, more recent deaths under the sign of the Orthodox cross, a few with the Roman cross, some under the signs of their vocations or under individual expressions of cherished regard expressed in Roman or Cyrillic letters. Most contained an inordinately evocative and unassuming oval photograph – a portrait of newly-weds, a silver anniversary, a child, a teen or a solitary portrait of advanced age, evoking questions of what it means to live a time too brief or of extraordinary duration and event. In towns of the region likenesses across a surprising generational spectrum can also be seen in markets, schools and work in mourning clothes in honour of other family members recently passed, a traditional form of common observance recently revived. Like residents of Joyce’s Dublin they seem at once to live at once among and converse with the living as they pay homage in dress and likeness to the dead. This assemblage of former residents, many still receiving the care of their local relations reminded me of the large and increasingly neglected graveyard above the ruins of a once imposing Orthodox church at the foot of steep slope in Eastern Mostar, record of a once large Serbian population spanning two centuries. The graves are not mentioned in day tours of Stari Most, and perhaps it is this very slope that has been erased from the geography lessons of Western Mostar school texts. However, these graves do evoke the symbolic power and resonance for the living who possess such tangible sites for visitation, stock-taking and expression of pent-up gratitude, appreciation care and loss can fuel humanizing identifications quite different from their use as regalia of vendetta and settling scores. And how ominous in context is any neglected single grave, let alone a collection of a whole former community’s graves, remnants of a once living fabric of habitation divided even today only by a steep foot path run between the separate sites for Serb and Croat memorials.

This was a somewhat different perspective on the infamy of recent conflict, often fought in the name of ancient graves, monasteries and the lingering grievances of medieval days remote in every way from the present. How unlike the official graves and monuments of post-conflict commemoration of exclusively male greater Serbia or Homeland Warriors, a continuation of the pre-conflict rehabilitation of royalists, paramilitaries and those pressed into service along-side wartime collaborators with foreign invaders. In Mostar and in Bor graveyards remain microcosms of whole and plural communities past in which the great grandparents, grandparents and the parents of the living and the missing are preserved. Sorrowfully, patches (or whole hillsides) of graves unattended, do in fact signify familial and communal dying off, and the flight, forced migration and generational ties sundered – ill things each for the hopes of the dead and the sense of identity and legacy of the living. While links between the space of literary invention and the realities of the social present are not by any means a given, I find myself wondering if meditations on loss which abandon “official” touchstones of heritage, faith and nation in these fictions are just such an engagement, particularly of the humble and small-scale losses that seem to reverberate with such a common darkness. They are among the most inconsolable sort of loss, unaccompanied by a record of the circumstances whereby family members became missing and presumed dead or ended lives of inestimable value to the living by their own hands. These works, taken together, render intimate and effaced losses through personal voice, the prism of narrative and writerly experiment, literary media sanctioned neither by faith or nation, and as they do they may articulate an alternative to the limits and dysfunctions imposed by impersonal and largely narratives that originate in a mythic and dictatorial above.

Tackling Foul is set in the village in the village of Mokrin, one of a chain of hamlets and small towns that compose the “Grassroots Soccer League,” a collective from which no club can perform so dismally as to earn demotion. Mokrin is connected by local soccer matches, open-air markets, summer travel to Kotor and by conflict to Vukovar and its place in the events that swept across Serbia in the age of Milosevic. It is during the siege of Vukovar that the steps of the novel’s missing protagonist Sima, the narrator’s uncle and his father’s identical twin, disappear. The narrator morns three unresolved losses, that are of some consequence for the household whose sole male heir is our young narrator. Grandfather Duša has receded into dementia, carrying with him the secret of how to distinguish the narrator’s father from his twin Sima by appearance. Sima, conscripted to fight in the JNA actions on the Croatian front, contributes to a third loss with his disappearance, the disorientation of the father’s life- long dialogue with his fraternal twin – a loss marked each time the father announces upon returning home “it’s me!” to distinguish his arrival from the longed-for return of Sima. Biologically identical (Duša as his powers fail settles on addressing them in the plural), they have shared a common and incessant dialogue and been decorated by identical scars of their parallel passage through experience. Sima has a missing front tooth dislodged by a cavorting dolphin; father (known throughout the narrative present as the “Twin” or the “Referee”) referees soccer matches and among his many injuries inflicted by irate players and fans is the identical tooth knocked out in post-match protest. His loss of a kind of double paternity animates the narrator’s preoccupation with the body of the very different documents authored by the twins. The circle of those losses subtly expands as the documents are collected. Memories of the impulse to tackle cleanly acted out by Sima after a night of binge drinking and to referee, by the Twin who interrupts Sima’s display and call’s time, suggests the forces for abandon and art barely contained in the churning open-ended contests waged between forefathers and sons, among siblings and across the grass-roots soccer league on the Twin’s watch and now in Sima’s absence. There is also, the last effigy of a teenage neighbour who unlike our narrator is a brilliant soccer prospect. Shortly before the lad disappeared into the Vukovar inferno, the Twin video-taped a display of the boy’s mastery of footwork and ball control. The video-cassette remains locked in a suitcase, a legacy too freighted with belonging to add to the pyre of all else the conflict has destroyed, but too charged with parental loss and the Twin’s survivor’s guilt to be given to the boy’s parents who have remained alive. The family home is full of similar eccentric archives. Uncle Sima a left behind a single work of prose fiction, Tito in Mika’s Espadrilles the story of Tito’s mis-identification of a local poet and journalist for a bus driver by Marshal Tito during a formal banquet honoring municipal achievement in Novi Sad. Mika is later able to use a photo of his photo with the Marshal to cut through the red-tape required for the purchase of a car. The Referee enters each match he officiates in an archive of graph paper ledgers, authors a commentary the narrator entitles “My Father’s Rules of the Game” recounting the rules of the game perfected, analogies between soccer and the well-lived life and a Homeric catalogue of all the names, obscenities and injuries received officiating – he has been pummelled equally by irate players and fans – having like Woody Allen and Danilo Kis received beatings by a kind of United Nations of neighbours, aspiring toughs and schoolmates on the playfields of his youth. The obscenities, catalogued and taken in stride, are part of the equanimity and unprejudiced judgement the Referee extols. The numbers (particularly those on the player’s jerseys) feature in the colour blind Referee’s ability to keep order among the indistinguishable identifying colours of the two sides, an absurdly ingenious compensation for disability that lends mock-heroic scale to this and the other comic eccentricities and preoccupations of the Twin. The exact place of Sima’s last known appearance is never determined. The gap resonates as the older generation fades, fails and the younger generation seeks, through an accounting of the eccentric genre of the archive, to recover in the traumatized reticence of the present adult generation principals of continuity. A lower-case archaeology of heritage and identity results rooted in matters that straddle the public and domestic, supplemented by conjecture and invention. Examined through the apertures of privacy and eccentricity, our narrator crafts an account of shared manners of being in and imparting order to a chaotic and ephemeral common encounter with the shaping destructions of the actual world.

Our narrator’s rummaging of the familial archive, describes the selective, partial and discontinuous insights to be glimpsed and the medium in which they are conveyed. Having examined the most unpromising remnants of the lost and un-memorialized, (including randomly catalogued personal libraries, personal journals, receipts inserted as book marks in the texts of others, the minutes of soccer league steering committee meetings, supplemented by oral stories, the logs full of the numeric calculations of his father, his catalogue of personal beatings at the hands of players and fans), the narrator assembles something of a world view, one equal parts noise and elegy, omission and insight:

My overview of the game, now it turned out my overview of life, well, it would be hard for me to say that it was perfect. I watched life through the slats of the window blinds. Attempted to piece together, expressed in my father’s jargon- to capture the positions of my team-mates on the pitch – I composed a mosaic, using scenes I gathered peering through the slats of the window blinds, moving from one to another; now squatting, then standing on my tiptoes, leaning against the windowpane (41).

The Referee’s archive is a particularly fitting metaphor for the resulting narrative practice. A valid command of and perspective upon events in an enterprise contested over decades, producing outcomes equal parts intimidation and art, comes into view. Its medium is a pitch that can be by turns shrouded in falling darkness, scorched by the lucidity and fire of high afternoon sun, beset by thermal mirages and trod into quagmire or hard pan and its bleachers and sidelines embroiled by the partisan loyalties of multi-generational fandom while leaving unscathed a Platonic memory of the field as the ideal green sward of one’s youth and community. Our narrator assembles from his archive an account of the deftly arbitrated and artful war for supremacy-within-continuity that is football, the role of record keepers and memorialists to assure the game is practiced consistently on this side of ruin, corruption and crippling injury. This pattern of order and craft articulated at the intersection of contending sides in matches that are organized by the league which stages them, is valorized as a kind of open-ended and critical double of the narrator’s narrative practice, preserving pattern, meaning making and accomplishment among the flows of potential disorder and contention.

Tackling Foul like a comic lost and implausibly extended entry from Kiš’s Encylopedia of the Dead depicts a humble and resourceful cottage industry of abiding ingenuity and survival with storm clouds of former conflicts and conflicts in the making looming overhead. Set during the early days of the troubles, the narrator’s family home houses his mother Mila’s anti-Milosevic pirate radio broadcasts during the height of the Yogurt Revolution that consolidated the Milosevic dictatorship. The resulting multi-media encyclopaedia of minor league competition across an archipelago of small-scale communities, the multi-generational threads of family and the incremental and decentralized maintenance of lower case culture and working accommodation grown up around them, is recovered from the obliterating shadow of Milosevic era ultra-modern violence, dictatorship and its ersatz regalia of ancient heritage, faith and the vilification of difference.

The narrator and the protagonist of Victims of Biedemeir share two never-to-converge poles that lend speculative depth-of-field and deconstructive power to fiction making, the contribution of language itself to the shaping and articulation of reality and the role of imagined action in representing meaning, character and value. Together, artful design and the unintended meanings and influences it sets in motion, map the fallibility of human life, which can never anticipate or conceptualize by iteration the omniscient perspective in the imagined eye of God to which it aspires. The imaginative writer given the self-existing nature of his medium can generate, but cannot both invent and defer to orthodoxy and realism. He occupies a void that is neither history or reality, something more like a netherworld between self-inferring patterns of words and the meaning readers come to find in them. The writer’s constructions, gratefully, are not bound by the limits of our understanding and, at the same time any instance of composition is in fact a foray beyond what we can exhaustively know or uses others make of it. A novel is a kind of range-finding via the obliqueness of word in relation to word. Its overshooting and undershooting of objects the writer wishes to render, opens up a space never to be closed between representing and knowing. Šajtinac marks just this space as the terrain of his novel. Language hovers above the muted and inchoate nature of reality prior to or independent of language. To write is by nature to (over) state, and meaningful imagined action is an equally fictive tableau, but one that can be scrutinized for all the resulting contingencies the actor cannot know at its inception. The writer evokes a character who does little more than occupy the point of composition that produces a smudge of writerly self-reference to sound, soundings or surroundings. The dawn composed of vaporous degrees of greyness solidifies as a bank of the Danube that situates both writer and character, equally and in parallel quandaries, beset by chronic pain and failing health, “Plucking at images and sentences, building embankments and the locks around them, the acceptance of the first growth along the shoreline, of being colour and sound. “ As the writer writes, the actor Vukašin Pomorišac reads the Tuesday, April 2, 1991 New York Times for any documentation direct or oblique of his son’s death a decade prior by suicide in a plunge from a prominent Manhattan high rise during rush hour. The return to the text is provoked by Vukašin finding a cryptic reference to death trips and liberation in a borrowed occult encyclopaedia found in the apartment of Ratislav’s surviving brother Slaviša, setting in motion fears that his other son is at risk of some kind of cult-like exploration of death as liberation, a possible contagion inherited from his dead brother. There is neither the hoped for direct reference by news item, nor the obituary of his son’s death by suicide in a foreign land at peace, while oblique references to the mounting “troubles” in the former Yugoslavia are mentioned in passing. The organ of imagined metropolitan and global community, the NY Times makes space on the front page for an obituary and homage to the founder of modern dance Martha Graham, the signing of pitcher Doc Gooden to a three year contract with the New York baseball Mets and an article by Chuck Sudetic depicting trouble brewing between “Serbian rebels” and quotation mark-free Croatian police next to a drawing of the Plitivice lakes, “That text is controversial, imposing, almost prophetic; it hints perhaps at war, here where he is now, or here where he came from” (12). If Ratislav’s death escaped coverage in the Times, his steps prior to his death can be reconstructed from his effects returned by the New York authorities. Photographs in Battery Park with the Statue of Liberty in the background, the “CBGB” marquee Mecca of punk rock, the Book Tower from which Ratislav will leap. However, the copious documentary evidence does not reveal elements of an impending personal crisis. In fact, we will learn that the suicide is launched during what seems to be a realization of dreams, first-hand experience of the New York music scene Ratislav admires and a desire-at-first-sight affair set against the backdrop of books, visual art and the location scenes from a vault full of admired American films. The photos suggest personal pleasure of a long anticipated kind could somehow coexist with or even incubate the choice to destroy the self. The discontinuity between pleasure and desperation evident among the denial-ridden sound-tracks of American life comes into view only when a letter (the original misrouted by chance -written communication is it seems always hit and miss) comes to Vukašin providing a behind-the-scenes narrative of Ratislav’s photo album. This structure, in which visual documentation and the expressed values, beliefs and preferences of Vukašin’s offspring do not of their own yield explanation, has its parallel as the writer-arranger of the novel launches Vukašin upon a study of the life and work of Konstantin Danil.

The master of the Biedermeier school of painting is commissioned to decorate numerous Orthodox churches with icons central to the definition of the Church as an interval of sacred space in a fallen world. In actuality they prove as ambiguous as they are iconic. They are products of lucrative commissions by wealthy bourgeois benefactors that make Danil one of the wealthiest painters of his age. They are also an attempt to express by formal and worldly means (line, shadow, light, pigment, precious metal and decoration) uncompromised figurative renderings of the spiritual, as etheric and unalloyed as prayers elevated above impulse and self-interest. The most sacred stations in the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Fathers of the Eastern church seem opulent, yet consecrated by the authority of the Holy Church whose earthly buildings thereby merge with the realm of the timeless, a heavenly continuity that overarches the practice of human faith and frailty on earth. However, the pictures are also, chalk lines laid on by Danil’s assistants, too linear approximations of the painterly line that will flow from Danil’s esthetic and temperamental impulses that impel movement of the painter’s brush. Luminous, decorative, ornate, even luxurious, they seem a reality apart from and even an imperious contrast to the pallet of the landscapes and communities in which they are installed. The patrons are bourgeois and self-aggrandizing, the painter aspires to esthetic perfection, the religious dispensation under which he labours cannot be realized on earth, but is given iconic and decorative expression on which prayers, the social status of the patrons and the esthetic ambitions of the painter ascend.

Vukashin becomes fascinated by a subset of Danil’s work, the contested, unsigned and missing works attributable to Danil and their undecideable status – can they be authenticated and their value established on the art market, in the annals of faith and of the lands whose fruitfulness provided the material wealth extracted from them? Would only these unsigned works transcend the worldly calculation of fame, profit and orthodoxy of gesture and message that informs the work signed, commissioned and lavishly rewarded? The painter ends a commission with a visit to the completed main icon of the Holy Virgin a rendering of Sofia von Deli and of the Lord Jesus Christ. He composes a prayer while kneeling at the intersection of patron, savior and examples of his mastery of earthly representations of the unrealized unity towards which religion aspires without ever necessarily arriving:

The one who dared to look in this direction from that side of the holy doors into the eyes of the Master, the edified Konstantin Daniel, the creator of beauty, can see incomparably better than the human eyes can see. Look, Lord Jesus Christ, just this moment when Your human sight only lasts a moment, a blink, how from the work it is separated and with Your Holy Church is wed, for ever and ever, Your servant, the creator and painter Konstantin Daniel, the year of our lord eighteen fifty-five, here, in Zlobica, in Serbian Banat. And forgive him, this servant of God, all his pride and free him of all his human weaknesses, Your child, and let him gain from You and believing in You, Lord faithfully serving, for ever and ever Amen. (93)

Situated between the double gaze of the worldly beauty of Sofia von Deli in Danil’s effigy of the Holy Virgin Mary and the all-seeing gaze of his representation of the penetrating vision of the human Christ at the threshold of his transfiguration from man to God, Danil dedicates the work conceived as art and executed in human frailty. In a shutter-click of discontinuous vision (gaze of neither god or man) it is merges the Church an earthly institution that transcends time and which by its authority memorializes the lives and works of its founders and saints. But, what of works of art and artists, “living beings, who rot in heaven?” Their lives are terminated like those of all other humans, while their notoriety remains in circulation long after their passing – neither it seems, truly God or solely man. The distance that opens up between work and time, a trick designed in part to evade the wages of time, seems nonetheless moribund under its own weight, ironic approximations in pigment, gaslight and mannerism of the spirituality it hoped to render and perpetuate. The ultimate disparity between the figuration on which communication of God’s timeless and omniscient rides and the humble wonders of the prosaic world outside the Holy Doors are juxtaposed – an apotheosis of separations. The ponderous display of accumulated artistic striving and worldly pride recedes and alacrity returns, the prosaic replaces solemnity and prayer, the meaning and the limits of the master’s work sketched through the eye of one of Danil’s assistants, newly alive it seems to the ironies of esthetic mastery:

And then if there was a foggy or icy veil in the air, before our eyes, crossing ourselves, we stood up and when we turned toward the other door through which we had entered the church and there we came upon the sunshine, the courtyard scattered with brightness of day, blooming fruit trees and bees busily gathering honey and not one of them trying to be the first or even the best among them.

There is a natural world – immediate, self-authoring and luminous – in which line, brush stroke, shadow, light and colour represent by figurative approximation and ornament. Similarly, the writer’s syntactical articulations both gesture toward and displace the events that flow behind and beyond the acuity rendered by verbal representations of worldly and otherworldly realities. The post-modern delineation of the double self-presences of language, the world’s self-offering and their irreconcilable distance, graphs the unarticulated, the amorphous and the activity of nearly inexhaustible form making and its invariable remoteness from the destination desired.

The theme of The Farewell Gift has a nearly apocalyptic doubleness that builds on the sibling themes of twin-ship and sibling bonds destroyed in each of these fictions. Here a brilliant sibling grown more anomic and erratic as he comes of age, establishes an acerbic and dismissive attitude towards his hero-worshipping brother and close companion as well as toward the intelligence and design of the world around him. Near-identity, overlapping intellectual interests and small increments of difference produce catastrophic and humiliating disparity for the narrator. He is left with only the unexplained disappearance and death of the elder brother and a non-descript tin of funeral ashes to identify the endpoint and significance of the elder brother’s descent into madness. What explains small differences ramifying in to disfiguring qualitative differences that dwarf and denigrate? The device of the double is used to examines the mirror-like family resemblance of two male siblings to explore the gestation of a disparity so inordinate. Closeness it seems can produce semblance, cooperation or rivalry, but not necessarily a vantage point that amounts to true knowledge or dispassionate insight:

Had I been able to observe the two of us at play, I would have realized that those subtle differences were big enough to account for one of the most pathetic Ping-Pong matches in the history of the Table Tennis Club on Anton Chekhov Street in Novi Sad. I lost fifty-six sets in a row playing my brother. Thus the expression “crushing defeat” acquired an entirely new, quantitative meaning for me.

The brother’s memory of arcane and technical matter is photographic, though not invariably tied to appreciation or engagement with the material mastered. His powers of retention like his command of esoteric knowledge across a broad range of disciplines is wide-ranging, yet utterly transient, abandoned whenever knowing comes to seem indistinguishable from social one-ups-man ship, feeding a sense of domination and superiority. His mastery of chess, table tennis, verbal put-down, the technique of classical painters, comparative mythology are each jettisoned in turn, in a kind of ruthless pursuit of knowledge to deflate, denigrate and discredit, a caustic epistemology that borders on descent into mania or schizophrenia on the eve of his exit from the sibling’s and parents’ lives forever and without notification. The disappearance of the elder brother is shadowed in short order by the expatriation of the younger to Manitoba for work and to evade conscription. The digression that follows juxtaposes two narrative modes, an open-ended catalogue of the madness merged with genius of the brother’s pursuits, and the digressive, discontinuous monologue of his virtual double in which these elements are floated. The two narratives threaten to merge and destroy, though the monologue recalls, circles back, perhaps presenting in narrative time, perspective unavailable in real time. Memory it seems is knowing; forgetting feeds pathology and blindness. The narrator indeed seems to have found a kind of haven and vantage-point in exile from which to view the housing estate and university bad-boy act of his charismatic other. Domesticity and rebellion, the colloquial and the elite, the prosaic and the arcane filter the other. The nearly merged perspectives together form a kaleidoscopic and fragmenting hybrid of bookishness, artistic pretensions, fringe hooliganism and contempt for poseurs, snobs and any form of celebrity. A carnival of intelligence, punkish attitude and dissolution in the name of authenticity makes an oddly nostalgic, yet acerbic period piece, brightness become inexplicable, a vaunted independent streak melting down as the inferno breaks out in Yugoslavia. The narrator’s unbroken digression upon the single subject of his brother’s exploits threatens to disappear into the compulsions that may have destroyed him. However, digression, evasion and denial, build layer upon incongruous layer of hard-fired recall of a brilliance that flamed-out before reaching its coming-of-age. The narrator produces an oddly unhappy and candid memorial. He clearly mourns deeply, but the portrait is far short of endearing; the brilliance depicted proves more incendiary than illuminating.

If the reader would prefer progressives and populists, draft-evasion and emigration belonging and dispossession sharply distinguished, or a chronological analysis of where promising lives and times went wrong, the Farewell Gift withholds just this kind of conclusive summation. The action begins with a pronouncement “My brother is dead. One could say a box of ashes is all that is left of him, but even the box is empty now.” It ends with an equally bleak instance on apparent if non-discursive closure, the inadvertent firing of the ashes into the glaze of the equivalent of funeral urn by the narrator’s wife in her pottery studio. The insistence with which the narrative has expanded upon, without ever leaving behind, the pronouncement in which the digression is anchored, becomes lapidary, glaze-like, without concealing a single flaw or anomaly of its subject. “Brother” and “dead” become terms equally fixed, inalterable, profound and fatal. The stoneware jar glazed by, but void of the consumed ashes, is a highly-finished conundrum. The hold of kinship and fraternity upon us, the ridiculousness of the evasions of the ultimate at the centre of familial legacies are equally on display. Around them, obliquely referenced, a sobering recent episode of European history in which the demons and drives that subvert self-consistency and mutual ties were given learned as well as primal impetus to destruction. Much of the memory of the mid-century events it mimicked had actually faded and fed North Atlantic by-standing. The fraying of ties to create personal or national independence, did little to replace brutal pursuit of self-interest and self-display with concerted reform and affirmation, or to install common over self-interests and the will to power. Centrifugal forces, without centripetal order, strong impulses without equally enduring ties. The narrator depicts attachments frayed in an anomic, technically and intellectually accomplished multi-cultural New City on the edge of the conflagration-to-come. The fictive funeral vessel produced by the rapid succession of biographical non-sequiturs and the sustaining pressure of the narrator’s pre-occupation with its digressive reiteration, suggest what can and can’t be made of the loss of the nucleus of common life in a troubled time. The flow of loss may ultimately evade the discursive, preoccupation. Perhaps the digressive impulse makes only a memorial object that grows in compactness and finish without edification, hard, Zen-like in its reserve and imperviousness to interrogation or forgetting. Loss can be hermetically sealed, opaque, pregnant yet inarticulate with the suppressed force for order and distortion. The funeral vessel seems at once frozen, furiously self-constrained, stranded far from the borders of its origins, yet saturated with the effigy of the heart and humanity it conceals. Our narrator seems to both engage and articulate a place outside the forces that produced the implosion of his brother’s life, and renders them as the still centre of disconcerting mayhem and loss. He also may complete the narrative miracle of re-entering the madness without imposing on it a false order, or using the material as a self-elevating settling of scores. There is a sense that “enough” is made of the long monologue. An end that will simply abide has been crafted; a thing of permanence memorializes a life and its brush with the forces that made of all bright things detritus.

I recently sent e-mail to my son after a silence and separation of some duration, motivated by my unremarkable recognition that my love for this thirty-something as child and adult, busy lives on opposite sides of the ocean notwithstanding, endures. The expression took two odd forms: a rant against the sources of the torrid crop-destroying weather of the Western Balkans and a nostalgic revisiting of our affection for American baseball, a small ember of regard for our shared home team fanned by ace pitcher King Felix Hernandez, who has authored a winning streak (one perfect game, four one-run victories) for the baseball ages during August. Added to my weather “update” (a three month stay untouched by rain), I ranted about the interest groups, the media empires and the carnal house capitalism that has obstructed and dithered as climate change smouldered and grew in its capacity to savage our globe as we have known and been sustained by it. My son would have to find buried in the odd preoccupations and excesses of my e-mail, evidence of a father’s desire to protect, nurture and share in references to childish things (sport) and a Jeremiad about tabloid culture and environmental Armageddon. How I love this child, and how unlikely he might know it from the medium I employed to express it. Happily he responded, recovering in the opacity of words his own need to connect and reciprocate.

What we write seems to both displace and yet become what we see, the medium of what we can know and the shape we can impart to it. It shapes whether and how we connect, sometimes in ways that serve and sometimes subvert what we intended. Never transparent, never neutral, but much more complicated than the truism that saying more or less makes it so. This space where our acts of writing make of our worlds what they will, is to a great extent at odds with the interaction between writing and memory that organizes Victims of Bierdemeier, Tackling Foul and The Farewell Gift and a vein of Serbian post-modern writing that makes visible a floating world of unexamined and unarticulated loss. These works are contributions to an at once fictive, yet encyclopaedic examination of the still-born lives of survivors and their lasting contribution to opportunities and burdens of life in Serbia during our time.

A dear relation recently mentioned for the first time the context of her divorce during the troubles that accompanied the end of Yugoslavia, the epical rhetoric and incendiary agents that promised momentous goods to be mined and historic evils to be rectified amid atrocity and destruction. All would hope the precipitous change and the grandiose narratives of mission and redressed historical wrongs would produce change for the better, and many incongruities and much degrading of personal and public conduct seemed understandable, a feature of the turbulence of transition. Only in retrospect, has she come to see that the hope widely invested in a change she had not wished for was used to install the abuses of transition as “new normal” one that has proven repressive, dysfunctional, yet formidably resilient. Two post-conflict decades of impasse, ubiquitous corruption and missed opportunity, carry the weight of belated and unacknowledged grief and dis-figuration. The past epoch, which harboured the common life whether in hamlets, cities or towns, whether destroyed by design, intervention or the collateral damage inflicted by both, have consigned no small numbers among the living and the lost to limbo. The young have inherited a sense of place truncated and embattled, a landscape where heritage edifices mushroom among shuttered factories to mark the new borders.

History moves on, but the missing loom above and around, inhabiting the ruins of a half-century of accomplishment effaced. Cultural, political and personal wrong-turns go un-examined as well. This drama has been so contested by force and obscured by ersatz traditionalism as to assure it will make likely be obscured indefinitely in public forums and official culture. Waves of democratic revolution in the face of dictatorship and repression, localized resistance to the ideologies of partition are consigned to forgotten micro-histories of the 90’s troubles and the post-conflict present. These three works – and I would argue much of the Serbian Prose in Translation catalogue – take up and engage significant omissions in official history and public discourse – among them the home-grown democracy of the prosaic, the local and the pastoral interrupted by conflict, and death under uncompromising centralization and endless transition to nowhere. As a species we have relied according to Aleksander Hemon in the wrenching account of the death of his daughter Isabel, on narrative when destruction threatens obliteration and extinction, “We processed the world by telling stories, produced human knowledge through our engagement of imagined selves.” I would insist only on the addition of “remembered” selves, selves memorialized in writing and telling. It is not hard to imagine readers upon engaging the imagined selves of these three novels will be provoked to archive the remnants of their own uprooted selves, relations and offspring. It won’t be easy – I know, but it is equally hard to imagine that it wouldn’t be a restorative and humanizing experience of great value.

Sudan amid deadly floods - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online",https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/379902/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-sends-over--tonnes-of-humanitarian-aid-to-Su.aspx,"Egypt has sent more than 197 tonnes of food and relief aid to both Sudan and South Sudan in coordination with Egyptian civil society organisations, the social solidarity minister said on Sunday, in the wake of devastating floods.

Dozens of people have been killed in Sudan and South Sudan and hundreds of thousands displaced as the Nile reached its highest level in a hundred years.

The NGOs that participated in the aid included the Egyptian Red Crescent, the Egyptian Food Bank, the Orman Association, El-Jamia El-Shareyah, Misr El-Kheir, El-Ber Wel Tawqa, Resala, and Dr. Mostafa Mahmoud Charity Association, the statement read.

The 109-year old NGO Egyptian Red Crescent, which follows the standards of the International Movement of Red Cross and Red Crescent, has sent an international relief team to South Sudan to distribute aid, in coordination with the Sudanese Red Crescent Society and South Sudan Red Cross, executive director Rami El-Nazer said.

Another team transporting aid prepared by the ERC stayed in Sudan for three days to assess the situation and provide emergency relief to those afflicted, El-Nazer added.

In the statement, Social Solidarity Minister Niveen El-Qabbag voiced solidarity with people of the two countries, saying that Egypt has always supported the people of fraternal nations during crises.

The floods in Sudan have affected more than half a million people, destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes, and raised the risk of disease outbreaks, the UN said on Thursday.

Due to the overflowing of the White Nile, around 5,000 people in South Sudan have been displaced and over a hundred have died, according to the South Sudanese state news agency.

Egypt has sent several batches of aid to Sudan as part of an ongoing aid airlift operation launched upon the directive of President Abdel-Fattah El Sisi to help the Sudanese people deal with the disaster.

In addition, Health Minister Hala Zayed travelled to Sudan on Tuesday to offer assistance, accompanied by a 20-strong team of doctors with different specialisms, as well as a number of nurses and experts in epidemic control.

912,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Spring flooding in Canada: Are you at risk this year? - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/spring-flooding-in-canada-are-you-at-risk-this-year-1.4337430,"With stubborn snow still on the ground in much of the country after one of the coldest winters in recent history, the threat of flooding looms large everywhere from New Brunswick to Alberta, according to Environment Canada.

The weather agency’s senior climatologist David Phillips said they will typically see the risk of severe springtime flooding in just one or two areas of the country, this year he said there are potential flood issues from the Maritimes through Quebec and Ontario and into the Prairies.

With few opportunities for snow to melt this winter, Phillips said a sudden transition to warm weather could increase the flooding risk.

“In every area we’re seeing snow that fell before Halloween is still there on the ground,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on Friday. “Heavy, deep snowpack, we haven’t got rid of it much this winter because we had the second coldest winter in 16 years and record cold in the Prairies and other parts of the country.”

New Brunswick, in particular, is at risk of another year of springtime flooding following record-high water levels and flooding in 2018, which caused millions of dollars in property damage. Phillips said the situation is just as critical as it was last year.

In Quebec, Phillips said southern portions of the province may struggle with flooding this spring. Quebec City has received more than 100 centimetres of snow this winter that still needs to melt, Phillips said.

With a dramatic warm up on the way in Ontario just in time for the first official day of spring, Phillips said northern parts of the province, including Sudbury, could see some flooding this year depending on how quickly temperatures rise.

Phillips said southern Manitoba, particularly Winnipeg and low-lying areas around the Red River, could be threatened with flooding this spring.

Saskatchewan does not appear to be currently at risk for flooding this spring, according to Phillips.

Further west, Phillips said Edmonton and areas to the north could experience flooding this year.

Despite “terrible” flooding in British Columbia the past two springs, Phillips said this year doesn’t look as bad for the province thanks to normal snowfall amounts in alpine areas.

The amount of snow on the ground isn’t the only predictor of flooding, Phillips said. Daily temperatures and rainfall in the spring can also determine the potential for flooding.

“What you need is the convergence of several weather situations that could cause you to get rid of that snow in a rush,” he explained. “You don’t want to go from slush to sweat. You want kind of an easy, slow [transition] into the spring and that would in fact help to diminish the flood risk.”

Phillips said a warmer climate can contribute to an increase in flooding every year because the atmosphere can hold more moisture, which can result in heavier rain.

“My sense is that trend has been there in recent decades and there’s no reason to suggest that it won’t go away,” he said. “I think that is something that we’re going to have to live with in the years to come.”",2019-03-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['snow', 'flooding', 'province', 'winter', 'risk', 'quebec', 'weather', 'ground', 'canada', 'spring', 'phillips']",Canada,news article,English
531,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,New high yielding maize varieties introduced to farmers - Ghana Business News,https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2019/08/11/new-high-yielding-maize-varieties-introduced-to-farmers/,"Share this with more people!

Two high yielding hybrid maize varieties have been introduced to farmers at a field show at Tinkong in the Eastern Region.

The field show, which was organised by the Legacy Crop Improvement Centre (LCIC) , a private foundation seed producing company was attended by seed and crop farmers from all over the country.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Amos Rutherford Azinu, CEO of LCIC said the two maize varieties, Aburo Legon and Abeefo Aburo could yield ten tons per hectare or 88 mini bags per acre.

He said the maize matures in 95 days and are planted two seeds per a hole within the distance of 50 centimetres by 70 centimetres and explained that such high yielding maize varieties were developed to ensure food security and help improve on the incomes of farmers.

Professor (Prof)Pangirayi Tongoona of the West African Centre for Crop Improvement(WACCI) of the University of Ghana , a maize breeder and a member of researchers who developed the maize varieties said the two maize varieties were single cross hybrid maize varieties.

Prof Tongoona said the varieties are not Genetic Modified(GM) products and tastes good when used to produce local dishes like banku, kenkey, akpele and others and could also be used for any industrial production.

He said the issues raised by the farmers and the research team would be taken into consideration in further development of the maize varieties .

Mrs Augusta Nyamadi-Clottey, Executive Secretary of National Seed Trade Association of Ghana[NASTAG] said, the seed trade association is an umbrella body of all players in the seed industry and the association was opened to all for information .

Mr Joseph Amartey , Chief Executive Officer of Victory Farms urged the researchers to consider further improvement of the maize varieties to produce two cobs per a plant.

He also appealed to the researchers to consider making the new maize varieties pest and drought resistant.

GUWAHATI: Fancy Bazar, Machkhowa and their adjacent areas in Guwahati are vulnerable with the fragile MG Road at Fancy Bazar has to directly break waves of the surging Brahmaputra. This has happened as the river bank has been submerged in this stretch. Will the road remain in shape if such powerful waves continue to strike it directly? The authorities can ill-afford to do something tangible.

The Water Resources Department has stockpiled sand-filled sacs at some fragile stretches of MG Road – at Guwahati-Madhyam Khanda Ferry Ghat and its adjacent areas – to keep the threat from the powerful waves striking the road at bay. However, it seems, the measure isn’t strong enough to keep the fragile road in shape. In the event of the MG Road giving in to the relentless pressure from successive waves, the entire Fancy Bazar and Machkhowa areas may come under the grip of floods, and this may happen anytime.

This is not all. A number of parks and other installations on the bank of the Brahmaputra in this stretch from Sukreswar Temple to Bharalumukh are under water. They are Sankardev Udyan, Azan Peer Udyan, Bhagawan Mahabir Udyan, Guwahati-Kasomari Ghat and Guwahati-Madhyam Khanda Ghat. With the sluice gate of the Bharalumukh closed, the surging waves of the mighty river have wreaked havoc in areas like Santipur. Sonaram HS School, the back side of the Bharalumukh police station and a section of Pandu Ghat are well under water.

The situation is no better either in other areas in Guwahati. Uzan Bazar; Nuapara in Satgaon; Tinitukura, Panikhaiti, Begnenamari, Tamulbari, Kherbari, Amgaon, Rajabari etc in Panikhai Gaon Panchayat have been inundated. Tantipara, Singimari, Panbari, Thakurkuchi etc in Chandrapur gaon panchayat have also been under water. The worst is that many fresh areas are being inundated in all these areas.

Only the tip of the Lakshmi-Narayan Statue in Aanta Shajya of Baba Chakreswar Temple at Kalipur on the bank of the Brahmaputra is visible.

What’s worrisome is – at 5 pm on Tuesday the river was flowing at 1.55 m above the danger level at Guwahati. The water level was at 51.16 m at 6 am, at 51.17 m at 10 am, at 51.20 m at 1 pm, at 51.21 m at 2 pm and at 51.23 m at 5 pm.

According to a flood report issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday for Kamrup(M) district, five villages in Guwahati Revenue Circle, 19 villages in Sonapur Revenue Circle, 26 villages in Chandrapur Revenue Circle, four villages in Azara Revenue Circle and one village in Dispur Revenue Circle have been reeling under floods. The total population affected in the district is 56,368.

Last month, the U.S. Air Force’s Tyndall base received semi-autonomous robot dogs, which are to be deployed in security surveillance roles there, marking the first time the U.S. military has done so.

In a news release published on March 29, the air force has noted that the dogs, designed by private firms Ghost Robotics and Immersive Wisdom, were delivered to the base in Florida on March 22 for integration with the 325th Security Forces Squadron (325th SFS). The Quad-legged Unmanned Ground Vehicles (Q-UGV) – which some might find mildly creepy – “will significantly increase situational awareness for defenders,” the release quoted Mark Shackley, Tyndall AFB Program Management Office security forces program manager, as saying.

“The robot dogs can operate in minus 40-degree to 131-degree conditions and have 14 sensors to create 360-degree awareness. They are also equipped with a crouch mode that lowers their center-of-gravity and a high-step mode that alters leg mobility, among other features,” the release also noted.

The Tyndall AFB has tried to brand itself as the “Installation of the Future,” with “smart-building sensors, increased hurricane wind load levels, and design flood elevation specifications,” and other enhancements to increase resilience, according to military officers responsible for the base.

“Across the base, every squadron has been pushing the envelope of how we do things and expanding our optics of what is possible. One huge attraction piece of the robot dogs is that it’s highly mobile and with the amount of construction we will face over the next few years, it helps us maintain and increase our security posture,” the March 29 air force news release quoted 325th SFS Master Sargent Krystoffer Miller as saying.

In November last year, the U.S. Air Force selected Boca Raton firm Immersive Wisdom to build a 3D Virtual Operations Center at Tyndall AFB through which base security personnel would be able to use the Q-UGV to patrol the base integrating sensor and video data streams in real time.

Commenting on the how the Immersive Wisdom tech will interface with the robots built by Philadelphia-based Ghost Robotics, 325th Security Forces Squadron commander Major Jordan Criss was quoted by an industry news website as saying, “We will be able to see exactly what the robot dog is detecting through its mobile camera and sensor platform if desired, we will also be able to issue verbal commands to a person or people through a radio attached to the dogs.”

Separately, robotics firm Boston Dynamics announced in September last year that their robot dog Spot – which can also be used for surveillance – was available for purchase for commercial use in Canada, European Union and United Kingdom. Spot made news last May when it was, well, spotted in a Singapore park relaying COVID-19 instructions, leading comedian Stephen Colbert to compare the spectacle with scenes from Netflix show “Black Mirror.” Incidentally, a larger, load bearing, variant of Spot – BigDog – was passed over by the U.S. Marine Corps in 2015 because it was a “loud robot that’s going to give away their [marines] position.”

In February, Spot yet again made news after a group of meme-makers equipped it with a paint gun allowing users to use the robotic canine to go on a rampage. At that time, Wired quoted a member of the collective as saying “… if we actually talk candidly about what it’s [Spot] going to be used for in the real world, you could say it’s police, you could say it’s military.”

The severity of the Egyptian authorities’ crackdown on dissidents in recent years has left many activists unwilling to defy the regime of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The waves of political activism that preceded the 2011 revolution and peaked in the wake of that uprising have been fading since the military coup of July 2013. Fewer and fewer democrats and human rights activists are willing to subject themselves to the regime’s wrath, which can include military trials as well as “torture, arbitrary arrests, and enforced disappearances,” according to Human Rights Watch.

Given this environment, it was a surprise when a series of short, straightforward videos started to flood Egyptian social media networks on Feb. 6, featuring citizens from various backgrounds making a unified statement: “I am an Egyptian citizen, and I say no to the constitutional amendments.” If adopted, the government’s proposed amendments could pave the way for Sisi to stay in office until 2034. (When he was the country’s defense minister, Sisi led the 2013 coup that ousted then-President Mohamed Morsi before becoming president himself a year later.)

As it stands, Egypt’s Constitution, drafted and adopted in January 2014 in the wake of the coup, stipulates that no amendments may be made to the article that limits the presidency to two four-year terms. This is exactly what pro-Sisi forces are trying to change. After the idea was first floated in the media by pundits known for their ties to the country’s rulers, the amendments were proposed in Parliament, which provisionally approved them on Thursday.

The amendments will now be reviewed in a parliamentary committee before they are put to another vote. If passed in Parliament, a national referendum will be held. Unfortunately, Sisi’s latest power grab has been met with nearly universal silence from Western leaders who profess to care about human rights and democracy.

Many Egyptians have already announced their opposition to the amendments online. The majority of the videos have been posted by ordinary people rather than high-profile activists. Many among the latter group are in political detention or in exile anyway, or they are trying to keep a low profile to avoid the fate of those who are already under the security forces’ grip.

Instead, anger is being expressed in hundreds of videos that are posted on an anonymous Facebook page that defines its mission as helping Egyptians seek “change for the better” and “organize” to make that change happen. Ordinary people have been filming themselves expressing their opposition to the amendments and posting their videos online, in rapidly increasing numbers, via this page. The videos feature random faces of women and men, young and old, and bourgeois and working-class citizens as they make short statements against the backgrounds of simple Egyptian homes.

Some have no faces at all; they recorded only their voices to avoid being identified and harmed by the government’s security agencies. Commenters cheer for those who have had the courage to express their rejection of the amendments. The commenters also express their fear: “May God protect you” and “Stay safe” appear alongside “Bravo” and “We will prevail.”

None of those who posted the videos are reported to have been arrested or harmed, but fear for their safety is growing and justified. The Sisi regime has not taken action against every single dissenter, but it typically takes action at random, and when it does, it can be vicious and merciless. An estimated 60,000 people have been arrested “on political grounds” since the coup.

The regime’s response has already started—not toward those in the videos but toward a prominent public figure: Khaled Youssef, a film director and member of Parliament who had expressed support for Sisi amid the 2013 coup and who was a member of the committee that drafted the constitution in 2014. Youssef announced on Feb. 3 that he was against the amendments, adding on his Facebook and Twitter accounts that he realized this stance might result in imprisonment on “fake charges.”

His prediction has partially come true. Two actresses were arrested on Feb. 7 for committing “debauchery” over a leaked video in which they appear dancing in their underwear. The actresses reportedly told investigators that the video was filmed by Youssef in his apartment, according to Egyptian media outlets. While Youssef himself has not been arrested, he is being subjected to what he described to BBC Arabic as a “moral assassination.” In the context of a conservative Egyptian society, extramarital sexual relationships can seriously damage a public figure’s reputation. The two actresses’ arrest also constitutes an indirect threat against Youssef: If they were arrested, then he might soon be detained, too.

In a similar episode, a pro-government lawyer filed a lawsuit against yet another lawmaker, Haitham al-Hariri, who voiced his criticism of the amendments. The lawyer accuses Hariri of “harassment over the phone” in relation to a leaked call between him and his female office manager.

The issue is not whether the leaked recordings are real or whether Youssef and Hariri engaged in behavior that requires prosecution—it is rather about the timing at which their purported mistakes have surfaced. The current security agencies and judicial system are by no means known for supporting women against harassment and abuse.

Less than five months ago, an Egyptian court sentenced a harassment victim to two years in prison for a Facebook video in which she condemned sexual harassment and expressed resentment of the authorities’ failure to protect women. So when a pro-government lawyer, who is known to have acted on the regime’s behalf for years, accuses Hariri of phone harassment, this means that the regime is simply being opportunistic. After all, the same lawyer also filed a lawsuit in December against an actress, accusing her of “incitement to debauchery” after she wore a dress that was allegedly revealing and inappropriate. He is clearly no supporter of women’s rights and freedoms.

The silver lining is that the anti-amendment videos have continued to flood social media despite the attacks on Youssef and Hariri and in defiance of the fear that Sisi and the state’s security apparatus have been cultivating since 2013. This is not a sign of imminent regime change or radical progress toward more democratic rule in the country. It is nonetheless significant that Egyptians are undertaking collective action and becoming conscious of their ability to challenge a ruling elite that has created what Amnesty International calls an “open-air prison for critics.”

Popular anger has been growing, slowly. Sisi no longer enjoys the popularity he had when he first seized power in 2013 and 2014. The Egyptian polling center Baseera found that the president’s popularity fell from 54 percent in 2014 to 27 percent in 2016. In addition to resentment of human rights violations under his rule, anger against Sisi’s policies escalated after he devalued the Egyptian currency and lifted fuel subsidies that had been in place for decades. Both steps were implemented in 2016, leading to a hike in the prices of basic goods. This has in turn affected Egyptians’ standard of living and made it harder for many of them to make ends meet.

In the same year, there were rare and massive protests against Sisi’s decision to cede Egypt’s sovereignty over the two Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, whose rulers have supported Sisi and supplied him with aid and loans since the coup. The protests were suppressed, and dozens of protesters were arrested but only after they had signaled that Sisi’s actions would not always go unchallenged.

Unfortunately, the international community, by siding with Sisi, is defying the Egyptian people’s will. This is true of French President Emmanuel Macron, whose visit to Egypt in late January was an unmistakable show of support for Sisi and the ruling elite. Macron’s criticism of the human rights situation in the country boils down to empty rhetoric when assessed alongside the fact that France has become the top supplier of arms to Egypt in recent years. In addition to Rafale fighter jets, warships, and a military satellite, France also provided armored vehicles that have been “used to violently crush dissent in Cairo and Alexandria,” according to an Amnesty International report.

It is no wonder that the heads of Rafale producer Dassault accompanied Macron on his visit to Cairo, the very visit in which he said in a joint press conference with his Egyptian counterpart that “stability cannot be dissociated from the question of human rights.” Sisi responded by saying that “Egypt does not advance through bloggers.”

Macron’s policies are only part of a larger pattern across an international community that has recently engaged in unprecedented complicity with Sisi’s authoritarianism. U.S. President Donald Trump told the Egyptian president during a meeting in September 2018 that the U.S.-Egyptian “relationship has never been stronger. And we’re working with Egypt on many different fronts, including military and trade. … It’s an honor to be with you again.” Trump is also a strong supporter of the Saudi regime, which has backed Sisi economically and politically since the coup. And most recently, on Feb. 10, the Egyptian president assumed the chairmanship of the African Union—a first for Egypt since the regional organization’s establishment in 2002.

After being appointed the AU’s chairman, Sisi said in a speech to the AU assembly that the continent is facing the threat of terrorism. In doing so, he played a card that has served him well in international forums. Despite his tough talk on terrorism, Sisi has failed to defeat the Islamic State’s affiliate in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula nearly five years after he became president. And he has repeatedly misled his international audience by arguing that all his opponents are Islamist terrorists and that this justified their detention. This is not true. Many of the regime’s critics are secularists and liberals.

And those who do come from the Islamist-leaning Muslim Brotherhood cannot be described as terrorists, either. The group has repeatedly stressed its adherence to peaceful means of opposition. Its ability to pose a threat to Sisi’s power in any way has been dramatically weakened because thousands of its members were jailed or fled the country after 2013. Only a small minority of its younger members have reportedly become radicalized and disillusioned with the group’s leadership in recent years. If a small minority of younger Islamists have become extremists, it only proves that flagrant injustice breeds grievances and raises the chances of radicalization.

Egypt’s post-2011 political spectrum, which saw a stark division between Islamists and non-Islamists, does not represent the country’s scene any longer. Resentment and bitterness are now rising among Egyptians from various backgrounds, and many of Sisi’s critics are ordinary people with no political experience or interest in ideology.

It is up to European and U.S. leaders to side with the Egyptian people or with a regime that has trampled its citizens’ human rights. It is up to Western powers to live up to their claims that they value and champion justice, rights, and freedoms—or to turn a blind eye as their ally violates these values.",2019-02-14 08:00:00+00:00,"['sisi', 'amendments', 'promoting', 'egypt', 'egyptian', 'leaders', 'western', 'youssef', 'rights', 'dictatorship', 'democracy', 'videos', 'sisis', 'human', 'regime', 'president']",Egypt,news article,English

Berenike, also known as Berenice Troglodytica was founded in the 3rd century BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, upon a narrow rim of shore at the head of the Sinus Immunduson on the west coast of the Red Sea.

The city was named after his mother Berenice I, and served as a trading centre with the East Coast of Africa, India, and Arabia for the transportation of war Elephants and exotic goods.

The first stage of the Hellenistic period was interrupted by a period of abandonment for almost half a century around 200 BC, until the city was reoccupied in the latter part of the second century BC.

Archaeologists conducting studies of an ancient well used by the city garrison in a fortified gate complex, suggest that the city was abandoned due to climatic changes brought on by a volcanic eruption.

Previous research found that a volcanic eruption in 209 BC from an unidentified volcano ejected a significant amount of gas and ash into the atmosphere, shifting North-Eastern Africa’s climate and causing a weakening of the annual Nile flood.

The failure of the Nile flood drove the Egyptian people to rise up against the Hellenistic rulers of Egypt in a period known as the ‘Great Theban Revolt’ of 207–186 BC.

This climatic event most likely disrupted the fragile climate of the Red Sea region driving the drought at Berenike, causing the well to dry up and be buried with windblown sand.

Archaeologists methodically removed the thick layers of sand filling the well, where they found coins, amphora, and other datable material that suggest the event happened at the very end of the third century BC.

The drought closed the desert route to Berenike and disrupted the long-distance sea routes that the city was dependent upon, resulting in the eventual abandonment. Find out more

Justice Marete who was appearing before the Judicial Service Commission panel interviewing candidates shortlisted for the position of Chief Justice, said the nature of the disability was listed erroneously.

Marete however clarified that he had a visual and a diabetic condition.

""No, I have no mental issues. There was an error on my card and I have never had the time to correct the issue. When I applied for the card at the National Council for Persons with Disabilities, I highlighted that I have visual disability and Diabetes from time to time,"" he told the panelists.

He termed the mental disability inscription a 'non issue' but acknowledged being aware about it since 2015 although he, ""never got the time to rectify.""

""It never occurred to me that it would come to haunt me. I am a workaholic and have been so busy, peripheral issues like those didn't bother me but I will amend it instantly,"" he said when questioned by commissioner Felix Koskei.

The Employment and Labour Relations Court judge was further put to task over an impasse with the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary over his dislike for police drivers.

Marete noted that owing to his condition and rigid schedule, he prefers civilian drivers who he said are easy to manage.

He said he had successfully requested the Judiciary to hire a civilian driver identified as Mwangi on a contract basis but he was never fully employed prompting him to leave.

Marete noted he had stints with police drivers whom he described as very impatient. Since their departure, the judge hired a driver out of his own resources.

""One lasted a day with me; another lasted a week while the best lasted three months. They are impatient and all left, the reason why they left, I do not know,"" he said.

479,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,This Low-Cost Greenhouse Is Designed To Help The Poorest Farmers - Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com/40405369/this-low-cost-greenhouse-is-designed-to-help-the-poorest-farmers,"advertisement advertisement

For a small farmer in India, the last year might have gone something like this: She plants tomatoes, and the crop is destroyed by pests. Months of extreme heat mean that she can’t plant anything else. When she finally plants another crop, it’s destroyed by drought. After backbreaking labor, she’s still broke, or worse, in serious debt. In 2015, more than 8,000 farmers in India committed suicide, most because of their financial situation.

As climate change increases environmental risks for farmers in the area–from monsoons to heat waves–one startup is testing a potential solution. Kheyti, which recently won the Global Social Venture Competition, makes what it calls the Greenhouse in a Box, a simple, low-cost greenhouse that can sit on a small area of a farm and provide regular crops which guarantees year-round income if everything else goes wrong. “The biggest problem that we found is income variability,” says co-founder Kaushik Kappagantulu. “Farmers make money only once or twice in a year. That income is affected by all sorts of environmental risks, including unseasonable rain, pest attacks . . . That’s why they’re stuck in that poverty cycle.” The typical greenhouse available in India was originally designed for farmers in developed countries who grow high-value flowers or vegetables–and it’s well out of the price range of a low-income farmer. The new greenhouse is simpler, with fewer materials and a smaller footprint (it’s roughly half the size of a basketball court or 2% of the land area of a typical small farm in India). Two layers of shade netting on the top reduce the temperature inside by 5-8 degrees Celsius. Insect netting on all sides reduces pest attacks 90%.

advertisement

The team is now working with Extreme, a course at Stanford University’s d.school that focuses on design for extreme affordability, to bring the cost down further. The current version of the greenhouse costs $2,000 to make, and through a partnership with a bank, the startup is offering it to pilot customers at cost, with a $400 down payment and quarterly payments of $175 over three years. A high-quality cow, by comparison, costs around $800. “It’s basically the same investment that a farmer would make to start a daily operation, buy two or three cows so they can make a steady income from dairy, or invest in making a small poultry shed in their farms for chickens and eggs,” Kappagantulu says. “I think it’s comparable to other small investments that farmers make.” On average, farmers should make $475 a quarter from the greenhouse, leaving them a profit of $300 per quarter.

Still, the $400 down payment is more than the poorest farmers can afford. The startup is aiming to be able to offer it for a down payment of $100 or $200. In experiments on the startup’s own farm, the greenhouse has performed even as the same crops fail outside. “Right now the temperature in Hyderabad is about 115 degrees Fahrenheit, I would say, and in this time, nothing grows,” says Kappagantulu. “From this time until about June, farmers aren’t able to grow anything outside. When we did this experiment side by side, all the plants [outside] died when the temperature hit 115, and all the plants inside survived and gave us a steady income.” A drip irrigation system, coupled with the shade that reduces heat and evaporation, helps cut water use 90%. Along with the greenhouse’s ability to protect crops from pests and floods, this means that farmers can grow seven times more produce. But the startup believes that the greenhouse on its own can’t fully address the challenges that farmers face, so it also provides a suite of services.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said that at least 44 people died in the disaster.

“On behalf of me and all the people of Indonesia, I would like to express my deep condolences to the victims who died in this tragedy. I also understand the sadness experienced by our brothers and sisters due to the impact of this disaster,” said the President as published in the Presidential Secretariat’s YouTube channel on Monday, April 5, 2021.

He said that he has ordered the BNPB Head Doni Monardo, the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) Head Henri Alfiandi, Social Affairs Minister Tri Rismaharini, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin, Public Works and Housing Minister Basuki Hadimuljono, the Indonesian Military Commander Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto, and National Police Chief General Listyo Sigit Prabowo to evacuate victims and deal with the impacts of the flash floods quickly.

“I want quick disaster mitigation, such as health care assistance, logistics availability, and basic necessities for the evacuees, as well as infrastructure repair,” he said.

Jokowi then appealed to all people to follow the instruction of officers in the field and stay vigilant over floods and landslides caused by extreme rainfall in recent times. “Pay attention to early warnings issued by BMKG and regional officials,” he asserted.

Assam heartthrob Riyan Parag is the latest to step forward and contribute Rs 1 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMFR).

On Saturday, Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal took to Twitter to express his gratitude towards the Assam cricketer. “Thank you @ParagRiyan for your contribution of Rs 1 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. It is heartening to see the young generation coming forward in large numbers to help those affected during #AssamFloods,” he tweeted.

Hailing from Assam, Parag was one of the most promising cricketers in this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) and was a part of the India Under-19 side for the two youth Tests in England. He was India’s second highest run-getter behind Parthiv Shaw in the youth Tests and played a crucial role during India’s win in Chesterfield.

In October 2017, Parag was named in India’s squad for the 2017 ACC Under-19 Asia Cup. He made his first-class debut for Assam in the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy against Hyderabad and has one 50 to his credit.

1398,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Kenya prepares to crack down on high-interest loan apps - Quartz,https://qz.com/africa/1975202/kenya-prepares-to-crack-down-on-high-interest-loan-apps/,"A new Kenyan bill seeks to license and regulate digital lending platforms in the country, in a bid to clamp down on the issuance of high-interest loans as well as the predatory practices that have accompanied the industryâ??s massive growth.

Mobile lending apps have become an easy source of credit for Kenyans who donâ??t have accounts with banks and other traditional financial institutions, or the regular income needed to borrow from such establishments.

Since the launch of the mobile-based savings and loans product M-Shwari by Safaricom in 2012, dozens of lending apps have popped up offering short-term loans, and with many selling the goal of financial inclusivity. The apps in the market include Silicon Valleyâ??backed Tala and Branch, as well as Zenka, Opesa and Okash, which is owned by the Norwegian software maker Opera.

Financial inclusionâ??defined as access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet needs and are delivered in a responsible and sustainable wayâ??rose from 26.7% in 2006 to 82.9% in 2019 in Kenya, driven largely by the growth of mobile money. A 2019 survey on digital credit found that 13.6% of Kenyans had borrowed loans from a digital lender, citing their convenience and ease of access.

But the industry has been largely unregulated. As a result, some apps offer loans with annual percentage rates of up to 400%, and borrowers have accused them of shady practices including illegally mining customer data, and shaming of defaulters.

As an example of the rates on offer, Tala currently offers 30-day loans with interest of between 7 and 19% per month, while Branch charges interest of between 2 and 16% percent per month for loans of up to $700. A standard bank loan in Kenya has an average rate of approximately 12%.

Digital loans usually have a repayment period of less than one month, and borrowers who roll over their loans have to pay interest on the balance.

While digital loans have helped with access to finance, they have been linked with an increase in personal debt, with a concerning number of customers using the loans to pay for basic household expenses.

The privacy of app users has also been an issue for some time. Some digital lending apps have been accused of collecting data on location, call records, and text messages, many times from unknowing customers, to make financial decisions.

They have also been accused of using data from borrowersâ?? phones to shame them when they default on the loans, in some cases making threatening calls to the borrower, and sending text messages to contacts in their phone books.

Reuters/Thomas Mukoya An online financial micro lending platform is seen on a mobile phone in 2018.

Citing public complaints over the misuse of the credit information-sharing process, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) last year stopped digital lenders from forwarding defaultersâ?? names to credit reporting agencies. It also stopped the blacklisting of defaulters for amounts less than $10. CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge has on many occasions criticized the practices of digital lenders, even comparing the apps to shylocks and calling them fleas.

Google, which hosts loan apps on its store, has also taken measures to protect consumers. In 2019, it barred apps that promote personal loans that require repayment in full in 60 days or less from its app store.

The new bill seeks to have the CBK, the countryâ??s monetary authority, license and regulate digital lenders. Currently, the authority licenses, regulates and supervises deposit-taking institutions. Digital lenders have escaped the CBKâ??s scrutiny thus far because they donâ??t take deposits.

â??Weâ??re trying to protect or provide a safe space for everyone,â? the billâ??s sponsor, nominated legislator Gideon Keter, told Quartz.

The proposed legislation will be introduced in parliament on Thursday.

Outrage as IDPs camps overflows with displaced residence



Governor raises the alarm as terrorists hoist flag in Kaore community

Affected communities speak out: We dont want Govt food or money but adequate security to enable us to return home

CAN goes spiritual; declares 3-day fast

By Wole Mosadomi

Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We dont need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation, he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for Gods intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

1347,FL-2017-000155-VNM,Guy Carpenter launches new Vietnam flood model - Reinsurance News,https://www.reinsurancene.ws/guy-carpenter-launches-new-vietnam-flood-model/,"Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance arm of global brokerage Marsh, has announced the launch of its new flood model for Vietnam.

The probabilistic model will provide full national coverage and help re/insurers to assess their exposure to floods  a peril that affects 70% of the population in Vietnam.

The Guy Carpenter Vietnam Flood Model is based on a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue that simulates both fluvial (riverine) and pluvial (rainfall) flooding.

It can produce event-loss tables, occurrence exceedance probability curves and average annual losses at any level of aggregation.

Outputs can be leveraged using Guy Carpenters MetaRisk platform to analyze reinsurance structures and for capital modeling.

The population of Vietnam is particularly exposed to flood, said Tony Gallagher, CEO of Guy Carpenters Asia-Pacific region.

The Red River delta in the north of the country is very heavily populated and includes extensive industrial areas and the capital city Ha Noi. The Mekong delta in the south, which also has a large population, is very important for agriculture. Additionally, the country is subject to both typhoon and monsoon, Gallagher explained.

These factors combine to create a challenging situation and our Vietnam Flood Model is helping to address these risks. Guy Carpenter is dedicated to working with our clients to help them understand and manage their exposure to natural perils.

The new Vietnam model is the latest in a series of Guy Carpenter models for the region that includes Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.",2020-11-10 08:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'model', 'reinsurance', 'population', 'flood', 'guy', 'help', 'launches', 'carpenter', 'vietnamthe', 'includes']",Vietnam,news article,English
1145,FL-2021-000038-KEN,AFRICA: FAO and IMO launch GloLitter programme to clean up oceans - AFRIK 21,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/africa-fao-and-imo-launch-glolitter-programme-to-clean-up-oceans/,"Plastic waste dumped in the oceans kills many animals every year in Africa. It also has a real impact on the health of populations. In Tunisia, for example, 23 beaches were closed in 2020 because their water was unsuitable for swimming. Most of the rubbish in the oceans is dumped by ships.

The GloLitter Partnerships (GLP) programme, launched by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), aims to support partner countries in their plastic waste management policies. This is the case for Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Gambia, Kenya, Madagascar, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Sudan, Tanzania, etc.

A project supported by Norway

In the first phase of the GLP, the IMO, the implementing agency, will review the availability and adequacy of port reception facilities. The organisation will raise awareness among stakeholders in the shipping and fishing sectors and encourage the marking of fishing gear so that it can be traced back to its owner in the event of discards or loss at sea. “Partner countries will also receive tools, such as guidance documents, training materials and strategies, to help them implement existing regulations and communicate with each other, as well as to support them in developing port waste management plans,” says Jose Matheickal, head of the IMO’s Partnerships and Projects Department. The GLP programme is funded by the Norwegian Development Agency (Norad) and is expected to end in 2023.

As part of the GLP, the IMO will also raise awareness of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol) among officials in partner countries. The text provides for a ban on the discharge of plastics (including fishing gear) from ships at sea. In addition, the Protocol to the London Convention, which regulates the dumping of waste from ships and only allows certain types of non-harmful waste, will also need to be respected by partner countries to break the vicious circle of plastic waste pollution in their oceans.

In addition, the GloLitter Partnerships programme will promote the development of a circular economy in the plastic value chain in Africa, notably through recycling.

885,FL-2019-000084-IND,Old images of 2014 Bangladesh floods shared as Assam floods - Alt News,https://www.altnews.in/old-images-from-andhra-pradesh-and-bangladesh-shared-as-2019-assam-floods/,"Photographs of a teenager saving a deer from floodwaters are yet again circulating on social media in the wake of devastating floods in Assam where the death toll has crossed 100. Over 100 animals have also died in the Kaziranga National Park. Rakshith Shivaram who identifies himself as Former State Secretary, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, drew over 31,000 likes and close to 8,000 retweets for the images.

The images were also carried on the front page of Gujarat-based Sandesh News.

Recurring images

One Susanta Nanda IFS tweeted one of the same images during the 2019 Assam floods, “Hero’s are made by the paths they choose & not by the power they grace. This picture of the earth hero from Assam is simply outstanding”. Last year, the floods had reportedly taken the lives of at least 80 people.

Another picture of a man carrying a baby above his shoulders while his body is submerged in water was also circulated with the claim that it depicts the floods in Assam.

Fact-check

On reverse searching the images on Google, Alt News found that they are old and are unrelated to the 2019 Assam floods.

Image 1

The pictures of the fawn were clicked during floods in Bangladesh in February 2014. According to a photo-story by UK-based Daily Mail, the incident took place in Noakhali, Bangladesh where wildlife photographer Hasibul Wahab had captured this brave act by a teenager named Belal. “During the ordeal onlookers were unsure whether the boy was going to appear again. When he finally made it to the other side the locals cheered as the deer was reunited with its family.”, stated the report.

The report includes several pictures of the incident.

In 2016, Assam government in a major goof-up had included one such image in its interim report on Assam floods to Union home minister Rajnath Singh.

Image 2

The other image was shot during the 2016 floods in Andhra Pradesh. Here, a desperate father was carrying his sick baby on his head through deep floodwaters to reach the nearest hospital in the state. “Pangi Satibabu, 30, a farmer, from Kudumusare village in Andhra Pradesh, carried his six-month-old daughter above his head for three miles to the nearest health centre after heavy rainfall led to a deluge.”, stated an article published by Daily Mail on September 29, 2016.

In conclusion, old and unrelated photographs clicked during floods in Bangladesh and Andhra Pradesh, India were shared as the impact of the recent floods in Assam.

1389,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Floods on record-high Lake Victoria expose need for water cooperation - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-floods-environment-trfn-idUSKCN25F1YU,"BUDALANGI, Kenya (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenyaâ??s western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africaâ??s largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called â??backflowâ?.

â??We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,â? said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

â??There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,â? said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lakeâ??s water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

â??Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,â? he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Ugandaâ??s Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Ugandaâ??s environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the â??speedy movement of water into the lakes and riversâ? feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoriaâ??s shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

â??While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,â? Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenyaâ??s government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

â??The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,â? Opere said.",2020-08-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['victoria', 'lake', 'rainfall', 'rivers', 'expose', 'need', 'climate', 'recordhigh', 'water', 'dams', 'flooding', 'cooperation', 'floods', 'school', 'uganda']",Kenya,news article,English
732,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,ECHO Factsheet – Southern Africa and Indian Ocean – October 2019 - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/echo-factsheet-southern-africa-and-indian-ocean-october-2019,"Introduction

Cyclones, floods, drought, and disease outbreaks continue to affect millions of people in the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region. Tropical cyclone Idai battered Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi in March 2019, leaving more than 3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. It was followed shortly after by tropical cyclone Kenneth, which hit Mozambique and Comoros. A drought in the region is already putting further strains on food availability. Early warning systems and early action can reduce the impact of natural disasters. EU assistance helps to strengthen the capacity of communities and disaster management authorities to deal with recurrent natural disasters.

What are the needs?

Extreme weather events are a regular occurrence in the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region. They are becoming all the more frequent and intense as a result of climate change. The food and nutrition situation in the region has deteriorated as households are grappling with the impact of recurrent disasters that have severely damaged their harvests and access to food. In March 2019, tropical cyclone Idai made landfall in central Mozambique, bringing devastating rains and floods that left 3 million people in need of emergency assistance in Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. More than 650 people died while countless others lost their homes and livelihoods. Swathes of cultivated land were damaged by the floods. Just 6 weeks later, another cyclone struck northern Mozambique and Comoros, creating additional humanitarian needs.

In Mozambique, the cyclones came just before the annual harvest season and exacerbated food availability, as some cyclone-hit areas were already in the grip of drought, crop pests, and low agricultural yields.

In Zimbabwe, the floods that resulted from cyclone Idai put further pressures on food availability, already strained by a spell of drought and a volatile economic situation, affecting almost 3 million people.

In Southern Africa, the 2018/19 rainy season in the central and western countries of the region has been recorded as the driest since 1981. In August 2019, Zimbabwe declared the drought a state of national disaster.

How are we helping?

Since 2014, the EU has provided over €145 million in humanitarian aid for the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region, where EU funding goes towards disaster preparedness, emergency relief response, and food assistance. In 2019, the EU is supporting humanitarian action in the region with €45 million in funding.

EU humanitarian aid plays a pivotal role in promoting systems that can quickly provide vulnerable people affected by sudden disasters with emergency cash grants. This enables people to avoid having to sell their possessions when food runs out, only to find themselves even less able to cope with the next disaster.

Preparedness and prompt action can reduce the impact of natural disasters and help avert loss of life, livelihoods and property. The EU supports actions that step up communities’, and local and national disaster management authorities’ capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters. Several EU-funded projects use technology and innovative approaches, such as drones – used in the Idai response in Mozambique and Malawi - to map high-risk areas, or mobile text messages to warn communities of impending dangers. Increasing attention is given to disaster preparedness in schools through the promotion of safe learning facilities, training of teachers in early warning, and informing children on how to stay safe.

Following cyclones Idai and Kenneth, more than €17 million in EU funding helped provide people in need in Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Comoros with food, shelter, healthcare, access to clean water (WASH), as well as logistics support to reach isolated and cut-off areas. In the wake of cyclone Idai, civil protection teams from several EU countries were deployed to Mozambique through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Their emergency response included search and rescue operations, the setting up of emergency field hospitals, water purification systems and telecommunications support for humanitarian workers. The European Commission’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service was activated to provide regular reference maps, showing the extent of the damage and inaccessible areas.

Beyond the immediate response, the EU also allocated an additional €10 million for Mozambique to address increasing food insecurity, health needs and emergency prepositioning to ensure preparedness for similar natural disasters. In Zimbabwe, the EU mobilised an additional €10 million in funding to address humanitarian needs in the country, arising from a combination of weather-related disasters (cyclone Idai and drought) and the deteriorating economic situation.

On 1 June 2019, the EU pledged an additional €200 million at the International Donors Pledging Conference in Mozambique to help the country in its recovery efforts and in strengthening its resilience. Of this amount, €100 million will come from the European Development Fund, while the remaining €100 million will be available in loans through the European Investment Bank.",2019-10-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'mozambique', 'indian', 'echo', 'southern', 'idai', 'humanitarian', 'factsheet', 'cyclone', 'ocean', '2019', 'food', 'emergency', 'million', 'eu', 'disasters', 'region']",Mozambique,news article,English
369,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia Rainfall Forecast - Issued: 26 April 2021 - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-rainfall-forecast-issued-26-april-2021,"The Gu rains continued to spread in time and space over the last few days with many places recording moderate rains across the country. Notably, good rains were recorded in Puntland and Somaliland between 23rd and 25th of April. However, some parts are yet to receive the Gu rains. The Ethiopian highlands also experienced good rains over the week ending on 25 April 2021. The rains comes as an immediate relief to the drought stricken areas which will see water sources recharge and pasture growth.

The cumulative rainfall forecast for this week indicates significant spread of the rains to Somaliland and Puntland with most of the rains expected fall towards the end of the week. In particular heavy rains are expected in Caluula, Qandala Bossaso and Lasqoray districts on 30 April to 02 May. The central and southern region will see light to moderate rains within the week in forecast. In the Ethiopian highland, whose rainfall is largely responsible for increase in river flow along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers inside Somalia, moderate to high rainfall is foreseen in the coming one week.

It is worth nothing that, the observed rains and the foreseen rains in the coming week are not sufficient to alleviate the current drought conditions in the country, more rains with good quantity, temporal and spatial distribution are required during the season in order to meet the current water deficit and improve the situation.

River levels along the Shabelle have increased slightly at Belet Weyne over the last few days, but remains low and below the normal for this period of the year. Along Juba River the levels are within normal for this period. Given the rainfall forecast, a slight increase in the levels for both rivers is expected with no risk of flooding over the next seven days.

979,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egyptian mummy survives flooding at Jaipur museum - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/egyptian-mummy-survives-flooding-at-jaipur-museum/article32397949.ece,"Alert staff broke the glass case and carried it from the basement to a dry area on the upper floor

A 2,300-year-old Egyptian mummy was among the rare objects of historical interest which were saved from drowning at the Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur during the torrential rains that lashed the city last week. The mummy was taken out of its glass box in the museum’s basement and shifted to another hall in the building.

The rainwater, which inundated several roads and residential colonies of the State capital on August 14, entered the museum’s basement and submerged artefacts, paintings, maps, files and documents. Just before the water at four-foot level could touch the mummy, the staff broke the glass and carried it to a dry area on the upper floor.

The mummy, named Tutu, a female member of a family of priests, dates back to Egypt’s Ptolemic period from early 300 B.C. to 30 B.C. It was excavated from a pyramid in Akhmim area of the ancient city of Panopolis.

It is one of only six mummies in India and was gifted by the Museum of Cairo for an exhibition in Jaipur organised by the then ruler of the princely state, Sawai Madho Singh II, in 1887. Three experts from Egypt’s Ministry of Culture, who came here in 2011 to conserve the mummy, had concluded that it was in good condition. They had sterilised all the attached objects to wipe out microbes.

Main attraction

The mummy has been one of the main attractions of the museum, which functions in the historic building constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style. The museum is named after King Edward VII (Albert Edward) during whose visit to the city as the Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British throne its foundation stone was laid in 1876.

After the rains, hundreds of documents and antiques have been strewn on the floors of the museum for drying. The entry of tourists has been closed for seven days, said Prakash Chandra Sharma, Director, Department of Archaeology and Museums.

Diya Kumari, a member of Jaipur’s erstwhile royal family and a BJP MP from Rajsamand, expressed shock at the damage caused to the artefacts in the museum. “Torrential rains and rampant disregard by the government have damaged the treasures of the past... That adequate measures for their protection were not taken is a sad commentary on the departments concerned,” she tweeted.

State Art and Culture Minister B.D. Kalla, who visited the museum on Tuesday, said the staff were vigilant and had rescued the mummy and other important objects. He said preventive steps would be taken to protect the artefacts and another museum would be established in Jaipur to display the objects of historical interest.",2020-08-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['glass', 'egyptian', 'city', 'rains', 'flooding', 'survives', 'mummy', 'jaipur', 'objects', 'taken', 'staff', 'basement', 'museum']",Egypt,news article,English

1288,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Malteser International responds to Uganda floods - Uganda - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/malteser-international-responds-uganda-floods,"Kampala. Malteser International is preparing assistance for people affected in the Kasese district of western Uganda following the region’s worst flooding in almost 50 years. Days of torrential rains have triggered devastating floods that have caused four major rivers to burst their banks, forcing thousands from their homes and destroying roads, bridges and public buildings.

Laura Beutler, Technical Coordinator for Malteser International in Uganda, said: ""The largest hospital in Kasese has had to be evacuated, leaving people there without much-needed medical care. We will be sending eight ambulances and a medical team in support of health facilities in the district. A lack of urgent medical care would be catastrophic, especially under the present circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.”

The floodwaters have damaged homes, latrines and water sources in Kasese district. Some 30,000 people are now homeless. “This disaster could have major implications for the COVID-19 response in the area,” said Beutler. “Those displaced have been forced to seek refuge in makeshift shelters where social distancing is practically impossible. The risk of COVID-19 spreading there is now high. To reduce the risk of infection, Malteser International will be providing daily access to clean water for up to 1,000 people affected by the flooding. We will also be working with our partners to provide information on safety measures against the novel coronavirus.”

Since late April, exceptional heavy seasonal rains have resulted in widespread across East Africa, killing nearly 300 people and causing a heavy loss of property. The disaster is compounding the risks to human health and food security from the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst locust infestation in decades.

Storm Molave, which made landfall at around 11 am local time on Wednesday, is one of the strongest storms to hit the southeast Asian nation in 20 years.

The resulting extreme rainfall could continue over the coming days, worsening the already precarious situation faced by many families, the UN Childrens Fund (UNICEF) said in a statement.

For the affected populations, their homes remain severely damaged, their food stocks have been lost, they have no access to clean water for drinking, washing and cooking; and water and sanitation systems have been damaged, said the agency.

Evacuation centres flooded

Thousands have been moved to evacuation centres, which are themselves flooded, resulting in difficult health and hygiene conditions for the displaced people, primarily women, children and elderly. Health centres have also been damaged, leaving without to access basic health care services.

Added to this is the trauma of the violent storms and rushing waters, that for a population where many cannot swim, creates fear and impacts mental wellbeing, UNICEF added.

The storm has also damaged vital infrastructure, including electricity and roads, leaving many communities cut off from assistance and protection.

Affected populations

An estimated 7.7 million people live in the affected areas, including as many as 1.5 million who have been directly affected, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam said in a humanitarian update late Wednesday.

Of these, some 177,000 people considered vulnerable (poor or near-poor), should be prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance, it added.

Response

According to the Resident Coordinators Office, UN agencies and partners are developing and will release a multi-sector response plan, within the coming days, to support emergency relief efforts.

In the immediate term, UNICEF has mobilized to provide emergency water, nutrition, sanitation, education and protection support, it said in the statement. It is also coordinating with Government agencies and humanitarian actors to reach the most vulnerable and those most affected.

Actress and environmental activist Daryl Hannah was briefly arrested outside the White House on Tuesday during a protest against a proposed $7 billion oil pipeline, police said.

Hannah was released after paying a $100 fine, following her arrest for failure to obey a lawful order, said U.S. Park Police spokesman Sergeant David Schlosser.

More than 70 people were arrested in the Tar Sands Action protest on Tuesday, which is named after efforts to block the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project to bring oil sands petroleum from Canada to Texas refineries.

The 50 year-old Hannah is best known for playing the mermaid Madison in 1984 film ""Splash,"" and had roles in 2003 film ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" and its 2004 sequel.

In late March 2019, Cyclone Idai made landfall on the central coast of Mozambique. Heavy winds and torrential rains brought devastation across much of central Mozambique, as well as parts of eastern Zimbabwe and southern Malawi. Around 3 million people were affected, including several hundred thousand who were internally displaced. Nearly 2 million acres of crops were destroyed. Just over a month later, in April, Cyclone Kenneth hit northern Mozambique with sustained winds of up to 140 miles per hour, affecting another 300,000 people.

This is the first time since standard weather-related record-keeping began that two major cyclones have hit Mozambique in the same season, and the only known occurrence of a cyclone striking the country’s far north. As a country with a long Indian Ocean coast, it is accustomed to tropical storms, but not to cyclones of this intensity. In Zimbabwe, Cyclone Idai’s unprecedented heavy rains destroyed crops at a time when many inhabitants already faced hunger due to persistent drought and a deteriorating economy. Climate scientists representing an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community predict that there will be an increase in the proportion of major cyclones with very high winds and rates of rainfall.

Indeed before the Ronaldo's and Messi's surfaced, there was Bernard Don Bortey 'The Serial Killer'.



In what seems to be the most trending on Social Media this weekend, Ghanaweb.com brings from its archives Don Bortey's free-kick that sank the Porcupines



Ten years ago, a lone goal scored by Bernard Don Bortey in the 10th minute was all that Accra Hearts of Oak needed to beat arch-rivals Kumasi Asante Kotoko in the second match of the GHALCA/MTN Top 4 tournament at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium in Kumasi on Sunday.



The goal came from a free kick which was expertly taken by Don Bortey after Louis Quainoo had whacked down Douglas Nkrumah just outside the penalty box and the back-to-battan, Bortey made no mistake when he delivered a curling kick to hit the net with goalkeeper Isaac Amoako sprawling.



Kotoko who lost their first match 1-2 to city rivals King Faisal at the same venue in the on-going tournament last Wednesday tried to make amends but failed to tame the Phobians.



It was a match Hearts deserved to win especially with their work rate even though it was Kotoko who started the match on a serious note when they tormented the defence of Hearts within the first eight minutes but could not find the net with Alex Asamoah and newfound Samad Oppong leading the attack.



Hearts took over affairs and nearly scored with danger man Don Bortey wasting two chances until he hit the net in the 10th minute. Kotoko accepted the challenge after the goal and came close to equalizing but Haruna Ganiyu shot in the 23rd minute went wide while Francis Coffie also squandered another opportunity two minutes later. Hearts Ishmael Aryee was flashed the yellow card by Referee Samuel Gyasi of Nsawam for rough play in the 39th minute.



Kotoko came back strongly after recess and made series of forays but the defence of Hearts stood gallantly to prevent any attempt at goal.



As the game progressed, Kotoko sensing danger brought in Edward Affum for Haruna Ganiyu in the 60th minute but it was still Hearts who continued to dominate the game with skilful and accurate passes with Don Bortey who was on top of his acts on day wasting another chance in the 62nd minute.



Kotoko's head coach Herbert Addo introduced Stephen Oduro for Jordan Opoku in the 74th minute while Hearts also brought on Abdulai Hamza for Samuel Affum in the 76th minute.



With their pride at stake, Kotoko made several attempts to level up the scores as they exhausted their substitution with Francis Akwaffo replacing Louis Quianoo in the 80th minute but still failed to find the equalizer till the final whistle.

Elaine Almeida looked at her aunt's ruined house in Sabara, a town in a southeastern region of Brazil where at least 45 people have died in floods that followed record rainfall.

""The water rose more than two meters, she lost everything,"" Almeida said.

She and her aunt tried pushing the door of the house open, but the mud inside was so deep they had to give up.

In Sabara, a town of some 130,000 residents on the edge of Belo Horizonte, the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, homes built on the banks of the Rio das Velhas river were completely submerged by mud and water, their roofs either ripped off by the surging current or caved in under the weight of the mud.

The football pitch in front of the aunt's house has completely disappeared under a thick brown layer of mud.

""The water rose very quickly and she couldn't leave by the front door, she had to climb over three walls to escape,"" said Elaine, 36, who is putting her aunt up while she looks for a new place to live.

Elaine's own house was spared the worst because she lives in a hillier part of Sabara.

Like her aunt, 15,000 people had to leave their homes across Minas Gerais, where more than 100 towns have been put on a state of alert.

At least 45 people have been killed in the floods, with the death toll expected to rise still further

Most of those who died in the wake of the violent storms that swept the southeast of Brazil perished in landslides or when their homes collapsed in the floods and unprecedented rains.

The authorities reported 44 dead late Sunday but a 45th fatality was reported Monday and the toll is expected to rise further, with another 18 people still listed as missing.

'Critical situation'

Gilvan Jesus Amorim, 43, only just escaped the worst. ""I didn't managed to save anything except my own life,"" he said, looking crushed.

""There's nothing to salvage, I'll have to throw everything away,"" said Amorim, who has been living for three days with his wife and daughter at a neighbor's house, with no running water or electricity.

""When it started raining, I told my wife we had to sleep upstairs and we took a mattress up there. But a few hours later the water started to rise really fast and we had to leave,"" he said.

His street is strewn with household items all coated in mud: refrigerators, remote controls, mattresses, scattered clothes.

""It's one of the worst floods I've ever seen, the situation is critical,"" said Lucimara Soares, a 42-year-old cleaner.

""Lots of my friends have lost everything, they have nothing left,"" she said.

Firefighters and the Red Cross have launched a campaign to gather donations to help the flood victims.

Most of the buildings that were destroyed had been built without permits and in areas considered to be at risk. The National Meteorological Institute said the rainfall was the heaviest ever recorded in Minas Gerais since records began 110 years ago.

(AP)

Incessant rains lashed Pakistan on Tuesday, killing 13 more people while the water level increased in the rivers across the country, creating a flood-like situation.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country. Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged. The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level, reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history. TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding. The Army and civil administration are working to restore the civic network.

The Meteorological Office of the country in its forecast warned of more rains.

Widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus along with Peshawar and Rawalpindi divisions, it said.

Scattered wind-thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy fall is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej, it said, adding that rain was also expected in Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan administrative divisions.

However, on the positive note, the Met Office said that the rainfall activity is likely to decrease significantly from 5 September.

192,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Engineering the Panama Canal Expansion - The Maritime Executive,https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/engineering-the-panama-canal-expansion,"Engineering the Panama Canal Expansion

More than 50 million cubic feet of earth needed to be moved as part of the Panama Canal expansion project which consisted of four main sub-projects:

1. Third Set of Locks

The project entails the construction of Neopanamax-dimension lock complexes on the Pacific and Atlantic sides. Each complex features three chambers, nine water-saving basins, a lateral filling and emptying system and rolling gates.

2. Pacific Access Channel

Executed in four phases, the project entailed the dry excavation of some 50 million cubic meters of material along a 6.1-kilometer (3.8-mile) span. The main concept was the creation of a new access channel north of the Third Set of Locks on the Pacific side.

3. Navigation Channel improvements

This component involved dredging of the Canal entrances in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as the existing navigation channels in Culebra Cut and Gatun Lake.

4. Improvements to Water Supply

The work enabled raising Gatun Lake’s maximum operating level by 45 centimeters (18 inches) to improve Canal water supply and draft dependability. Water has always been a critical resource to the Panama Canal, and the addition of the third set of locks created a greater need for even more water to make the expansion program possible.

In order to properly maintain and sustain this valuable resource for centuries to come, the Panama Canal designed and installed a total of 18 water-saving basins at the Expanded locks. Each of the massive basins has a surface area of 25 Olympic-size pools that utilizes state-of-the-art technology to allow the Canal to reuse 60 percent of the water per transit.

The Borinquen Dam

Work to expand the Panama Canal officially began on September 3, 2007, with dry excavations to create the channel that would link the Third Set of Locks on the Pacific side to Culebra Cut.

A crucial part of this project involves the construction of a dam known as Borinquen 1E. The dam is located west of Pedro Miguel Locks. It measures 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) long and allows the operation of the new channel nine meters above the existing level.

Dry-excavation activities in this area called for the clearing of 461 hectares contaminated with unexploded ordnance. The Panama Canal Authority found a way to use much of the extra material that was excavated for the expansion to safely bury a number of unexploded munitions left behind by U.S. soldiers more than 60 years ago, effectively using one problem to solve another.

Construction of Borinquen 1E dam clay core was completed in June 2015. In July 2015 an excavation record of 1.5 million cubic meters of material was reached, and flooding of the channel began in September 2015. The channel reached the level of Gatun Lake in November 2015, and due to requirements it was filled to its maximum level of 27.19 meters (89.2 feet).

Gatun Spillway

The Atlantic Entrance

The contract for dredging works for the Atlantic entrance was awarded to Belgian contractor Jan De Nul on September 25, 2009. Dredging was conducted in a 13.8-kilometer (8.6-mile) extension to widen the existing Atlantic entrance to a minimum of 225 meters (738 feet), as well as the north access channel to the new Agua Clara Locks to a minimum of 218 meters (715 feet). An option for further dredging up to 16.1 meters (53 feet) was executed, which represented an additional 2.3 million cubic meters of material.

The contractor deployed several dredges simultaneously along the area, including hopper dredge Filippo Brunelleschi and cutter suction dredge Marco Polo. Dredging operations concluded on January 30, 2013, with Neopanamax size dredge Charles Darwin removing the remaining shoals in the new expanded channel.

The Pacific Entrance

The contract for dredging the Pacific entrance was awarded on April 7, 2008, to Belgian company Dredging International Panama. The work consisted of widening the navigation channel on the Pacific entrance to a minimum of 225 meters (738 feet) and deepening it to 15.5 meters (50.9 feet) below mean low water springs, as well as partial construction of the south access to the Cocoli Locks. World-renown high-tech, powerful equipment including dredges D’Artagnan, Vlaanderen XIX and Lange Wapper were used in the project.

Culebra Cut

The Culebra Cut and Gatun Lake project entailed the removal of underwater material to deepen and widen the navigation channels in Gatun Lake and to deepen the navigation channel in Culebra Cut. Work in the Cut was completed at the end of 2012, and dredging works at Gatun Lake were completed on January 31, 2015.

The work included installation of 34 new navigational towers along the 38 kilometers (24 miles) of Gatun Lake, from Gamboa to the locks on the Atlantic side. These towers, which use LED- and PEL-type lights, replace light houses, are part of the Panama Canal Authority’s plans for enhancing safe navigation at the waterway in conjunction with the six towers that were built in the area of the new Pacific Access Channel.

The third set of lochs

At a cost of $3.2 billion, the contract was executed by consortium Grupo Unidos por el Canal (GUPCSA). The consortium is formed by Sacyr Vallehermoso from Spain; Impregilo from Italy; Jan de Nul from Belgium and Constructora Urbana from Panama. The project entailed the design and construction of two similar lock complexes, one on the Pacific and the other on the Atlantic side. Each has three chambers, nine water-saving basins, a lateral filling and emptying system and a redundant system of rolling gates.

To build the new locks, the contractor installed industrial parks at each site for concrete and aggregate production. The basalt rock extracted from the Pacific site excavations was used as aggregate and sand for concrete mixes at both sites.

The design and fabrication of the different components was a worldwide project. In Italy, Cimolai fabricated the 16 gates. South Korean-based Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries fabricated 158 valves, 84 bulkheads and 328 trash racks.

The Gates

The rolling gates system was one of the most significant elements of the locks design and construction, at a cost of $547.7 million, which included fabrication, shipment and installation. Each gate will open and close in four and not more than five minutes.

The six different types of gates were fabricated with features that vary according to where they are installed. For instance, the tallest ones – 33.04 meters (108.4 feet) – are installed at the Pacific entrance to the Canal, to withstand significant tidal variation. Even though the heaviest gates are 4,242 tons, their design incorporates buoyancy chambers to enable them to move on rails at 15 percent of their actual weight.

The spokesperson for the Ministry, Mohamed al-Sebaie, explained that negotiations will continue on Monday, with Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan having gathered all their proposals into one report.

During a phone-in with the TV show “Ala Massoulity” (By My Responsibility), Sebaie stated that a technical and legal member representing each country has been chosen to discuss the proposals during the remainder of the talks.

“We cannot say there has been progress or retreat in the negotiations,” Sebaie said. “All that happened is the formulation of the proposals of the three countries.”

Regarding the current year’s flood levels, Sebaie said that there is a permanent committee in place to monitor the state of the river and its flooding.

He noted that flood rates during this August have been higher than last year.

“The flood rates will be higher than the average, and we have a plan to invest every drop of water,” he assured.

The meetings of the second round of GERD negotiations began on July 27 under the auspices of the AU and in the presence of observers from the United States and the European Union, and experts of the African Union Commission. Its aim is to reach a binding agreement regarding the filling and operation of the dam. The meetings are based on the outcomes of an African Union presidential summit held on July 21.

Egypt and Ethiopia have been in multiple rounds of negotiations over the dam during the past nine years, all of which have failed to reach a final agreement. Egypt blames Ethiopia for the failure of negotiations.

Egypt, which relies considerably on fresh water from the Nile, has voiced fears that the GERD would negatively impact the country’s water supply, especially in light of overpopulation fears, and has insisted that measures be put in place to protect downstream countries in case of drought during the dam’s filling process.

Ethiopia, on the other hand, has stressed the importance of the project to bolstering its economy, where more than half of the population currently lives without access to electricity.",2020-08-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'final', 'talks', 'union', 'egypt', 'report', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'negotiations', 'proposals', 'reach', 'submitted', 'dam', 'sebaie', 'current', 'gerd']",Egypt,news article,English
1273,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Battling Rising Water in Uganda's Wetlands - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/battling-rising-water-ugandas-wetlands/,"KIKUUBE, UGANDA — Standing on the shore of Lake Albert, on Uganda’s western border, Sanyu Sanday looks out past the surf to where her small mud house stands partially submerged in the water. She’s salvaged what she can — her mattress and other possessions sit on a small motorboat — but after living on the lakeshore for the past two years, she’s unsure about where she will go.

“The raging waters have cut us off from what we knew as home,” Sanyu says.

Severe flooding has stricken Uganda in recent years, as changing weather patterns have led to increased rainfall, causing lakes and rivers to swell. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced across the country, particularly in flood-prone areas surrounding Lake Victoria to the south, Lake Albert to the west, and Lake Kyoga in the center of the country. It’s a situation that is likely to become worse as global temperatures rise and people continue to destroy Uganda’s wetlands to build roads, houses and other infrastructure.

Since October 2019, rising temperatures in the Indian Ocean have led to intense and prolonged rainfall in Uganda, causing water levels in Lake Victoria, one of Africa’s Great Lakes, to reach historic highs not seen since the 1960s. This has caused extreme flooding in the Lake Victoria basin.

“Too much rain means too much collected in the basin, which overspills and floods neighboring places,” says George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority.

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Sanyu Sanday’s mattress and other possessions are loaded in a small motorboat on Lake Albert. Her house, in the background, lies partially submerged in the water.

The government has been working to relocate thousands impacted by the flooding. But people like Sanyu, who built homes in parts of the Lake Victoria basin without obtaining official authorization, haven’t been included in these resettlement plans, according to Jackson Twinomujuni, commissioner of International and Transboundary Water Affairs at the Ministry of Water and Environment.

Achidria Tony, a spokesperson for the National Environment Management Authority, says that while the government can’t stop climate change or the increased rainfall it brings, officials are trying to prepare for rising water levels.

“What we do is ensure natural flood control systems such as wetlands and forests are not degraded and are instead used sustainably,” he says.

Decades ago, Uganda’s wetlands were able to absorb such flooding. But infrastructure development has caused the country’s wetlands to dwindle — from 32,000 square kilometers (12,355 square miles) in 1964 down to 26,308 square kilometers (10,158 square miles) as of 2005, according to the Ministry of Water and Environment.

“In 1961, 1964, the water was contained without alarm, because there was enough forest cover and swamps,” says Twinomujuni, referring to the historic rainfall Uganda experienced in the 1960s. “There were no paved homes and drainage channels, which do not retain any rainwater, but leave it with the only alternative to flow into the lake, hence the rise.”

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Nankya Amina points to the flooded ground floor of her house, along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kampala. Uganda’s wetlands have been severely depleted, due to construction and development.

Rising water is a problem in Uganda’s capital city of Kampala as well. Annual damages from flooding, which were less than $10 million in 2013, could increase to between $33 million and $102 million by 2050, according to a report by Wilson Truman Okaka, a lecturer at Kyambogo University in Kampala, who researches climate change.

In 2014, Nankya Amina built a house with rental units in a wetland area within the city’s Makindye division, along the shores of Lake Victoria. She hoped to generate income to help support herself and her six children. By law, property owners must obtain authorization from the National Environment Management Authority before they can build. But Nankya didn’t submit her plans for approval.

“I knew environmentalists would not approve my plot, since it was in the wetland,” Nankya says. “Also, I did not want to spend my money on processing the plan.”

Now she regrets the decision. The ground floor of the house is submerged in water and continues to sink, forcing her to live in a small wooden structure nearby. Even this living situation may be temporary.

“Nankya and 385 households in Makindye West division have to relocate and give back the water its territory,” says Achidria. “We sent out early warnings telling them to move before the floods.”

Sanyu, for her part, has grown accustomed to being uprooted. She initially came to Uganda in 2018 after fleeing violence in her native Democratic Republic of Congo, just across Lake Albert. She has been living in Uganda without legal documents, making money by catching and selling fish, while taking periodic trips back to DRC to check on her aging mother.

She had hoped to remain in the area and find employment cooking for workers coming to labor in the nearby oil fields. With her home destroyed, that future is now in doubt.

“We are turned double refugees,” Sanyu says, “unable to sit in either the host or mother country.”",2021-02-21 08:00:00+00:00,"['square', 'lake', 'house', 'sanyu', 'wetlands', 'rising', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding', 'ugandas', 'victoria', 'battling']",Uganda,news article,English

Authorities deliberated mechanisms to prevent such disasters in the future.

Ranjit Rath, the director general of Geological Survey of India, said that while prima facie assessment suggested that the flooding was caused due to glacial calving at highest altitude in Rishiganga, Dhauliganga and their upper reaches, it was still “too early” to predict the exact cause of the incident, ANI reported. He said a committee will be formed to look into the matter.

The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, which is also looking into the incident, also indicated towards glacial formations, reported the Hindustan Times.

“We do not suspect an avalanche,” said Jimmy Kansal, joint director at SASE. “There may be glacial lake formations, but we cannot say with certainty now. We are investigating the entire region.”

Explaining the phenomenon of glacial lakes, Professor Anil Kulkarni of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, said that they are formed when glaciers retreat , leaving an area vacant.

“Several lakes have formed in the Rishi Ganga valley,” Kulkarni said, according to the Hindustan Times. “In winter, the top layer of these lakes is frozen. During an ice avalanche or a landslide this top layer is breached and water can flow downstream, toppling the earthen dam. This is a common problem seen in glaciated terrain.”

Kulkarni said that it was a “classic case of climate change” and that such incidents took place often in Nepal, but not in Uttarakhand.

Meanwhile, the construction of the Char Dham Pariyojana highway project and a couple of dams on Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga rivers have also come under the scanner for causing damage to the ecological balance.

The natural disaster, which took place within eight years of a similar incident in Kedarnath, has also prompted the government to establish a multi-hazard early warning system for disaster-risk management, according to The Tribune. Currently, the Ministry of Earth Sciences can make predictions 24 hours before such events, which may not be adequate for sudden floods like the one that Uttarakhand suffered on Sunday.

As many as 19 bodies have been recovered so far, while more than 150 people are still missing, the state police said. The Rishiganga Power Project was completely swept away, while the Tapovan power plant was also damaged.",2021-02-08 08:00:00+00:00,"['ganga', 'climate', 'classic', 'uttarakhand', 'rishi', 'avalanche', 'lakes', 'took', 'rishiganga', 'experts', 'reported', 'formed', 'glacial', 'flash', 'say', 'change', 'case', 'incident', 'floods']",India,news article,English

In March and April 2019, Mozambique was hit by two consecutive tropical cyclones that left a trail of death, damage and destruction in their paths. In March, the Tropical Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port City of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow and leaving people stranded on trees and houses. On 25 April, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in Cabo Delgado province, flattening entire villages. Overall, it is estimated that close to 2.2 million need urgent assistance following the cyclones and floods (374,000 people from Cyclone Kenneth and 1.85 million people from Cyclone Idai), on top of 815,000 people already in need as a result of the drought.

The Tropical Cyclone Kenneth and Idai weather systems brought destruction and damage to Cabo Delgado, Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces, killing at least 648 people (45 deaths due to Cyclone Kenneth and at least 603 deaths due to Cyclone Idai), injuring nearly 1,700 and leaving an estimated 2.2 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection. Although the death tolls are yet to be disaggregated, women are more likely to die in natural disasters than men. The Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete in early March, displacing more than 140,000 people; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port city of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings and leaving death and destruction in its wake; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow, and leaving people stranded on trees and houses. Then, on 24 April, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in the Macomia district of Cabo Delgado, flattening entire communities in its path.

This is the first time in recorded history that two strong tropical cyclones (above Category 2) have made landfall in Mozambique in the same season, and the first time that a cyclone has made landfall as far north as Kenneth. The cyclones devastated two distinct swathes of the country.

Cyclone Idai hit the central region of Mozambique, leaving an estimated 3,000km2 of land submerged and damaging more than 240,000 houses. Subsequently, Cyclone Kenneth struck the northern region, destroying more than 45,300 houses. This came on top of drought in other areas of country, as well as violence in parts of Cabo Delgado.

The cyclones have compounded an already serious food insecurity situation in Mozambique. From September to December 2018, an estimated 1.78 million people (IPC phase 3 and above) were severely food insecure in the country, according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the food security and nutrition assessment conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) in October 2018. Of these, an estimated 814,700 severely food insecure people in five provinces – Cabo Delgado, Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala and Tete - were prioritized as being in most urgent need of assistance, with the most affected provinces being Tete (more than 359,300 people) and Gaza (more than 318,200 people). Following Cyclone Idai’s landfall, more than 715,000 hectares of crops were destroyed, while Cyclone Kenneth affected nearly 55,500 hectares of crops and caused loss of livelihoods, including fishing. Both of the cyclones made landfall during the critical harvest period, effectively wiping out the food the Cyclones. of thousands of families, prolonging an already difficult lean season and leaving many without the prospect of another full harvest until March 2020. All communities in Manica and 80 per cent in Sofala have reported harvesting less than half of their maize due to Cyclone Idai.

Both Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth caused significant displacement and protection concerns. Many children, elderly and people with disabilities were unable to flee to safety and more than half of the affected people are children.

The cyclones significantly exacerbated protection risks, including sexual and gender-based violence, loss of personal documentation, and issues related to land and property rights. Already, in October 2018, families in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala were adopting crisis strategies (17 per cent) and emergency strategies (13 per cent) due to drought, including selling productive assets and animals and taking children out of school to perform household chores, including fetching water. After the cyclones, many families lost everything – their homes, their livelihoods and family members – heightening the risks of their resorting to negative coping strategies – including child labour, child trafficking and forced marriage - to survive in the months ahead. Some children have lost their parents, while others were separated from their families as they sought to reach safety.

Access to safe water was compromised by both Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth, particularly for displaced people living in collective centres, as well as people in areas where water supply was cut. Even prior to the crisis, only half of Mozambicans had access to improved water supply and only one in five use improved sanitation facilities. Most households impacted by flooding during Cyclone Idai lost access to safe sanitation, with latrines overflowing and homes destroyed. People who sought refuge in collective centres – usually schools and churches – were living in overcrowded and congested conditions with limited access to safe water.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people living in Cyclone Kenneth-affected areas lost access to water, including due to power cuts in key urban centres, such as Macomia, Mucojo and Quissanga towns. Each of these factors significantly heightened the risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera and malaria. Meanwhile, women and girls have been forced to walk longer distances to access clean water and firewood, exposing them to heightened risk of gender-based violence.

Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai caused major damage to health facilities, with at least 62 health centres damaged or destroyed. The emergency room of the Beira Central Hospital was extensively damaged during Cyclone Idai’s landfall, rendering it non-functional in the aftermath of the storm.

At the same time, community health centres lost access to supply chains for drugs, with damaged medicine being lost and were unable to open due to flooding. It is estimated that 67,000 women impacted by Cyclone Idai are reportedly pregnant, of whom 60 per cent (19,000) were expected to give birth in the three months following landfall. Meanwhile, over 7,000 pregnant women are estimated to be at risk of unsafe childbirth in areas affected by Cyclone Kenneth. The majority of these women were attending pre-natal clinics in health centres which have been destroyed or damaged. HIV prevalence in Mozambique is among the highest globally, and this disaster is expected to increase the risk of transmission as well as to jeopardise access to care for people living with HIV. In Sofala province, which bore the brunt of Cyclone Idai, at least one in six adults are HIV positive. In Buzi, several women and girls who reported having sex for money noted that more money is typically offered if they do not use condoms, exposing them to heightened risk of sexually transmitted disease.

Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai and the preceding drought are occurring in a context of chronic undernutrition.

Prior to Cyclone Idai, five districts were expected to face IPC Acute Malnutrition phase 2 or above during the 2018-2019 lean season: Balama in Cabo Delgado; Marara in Tete province; Milange in Zambezia province and Macossa in Manica province. Each of the causes of acute malnutrition in these districts - including low quality and quantity of infant feeding; increased occurrence of childhood diseases, such as diarrhoea and malaria; low coverage of health and sanitation services; and low access to safe water sources – have been exacerbated by the drought and floods. Results from the annual food security and nutrition analysis (SETSAN) prior to Cyclone Kenneth already showed a concerning food security and nutrition situation in five districts in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to conflict and violence: Macomia,

Mocimboa da Praia, Nangade, Palma and Quissanga. This includes two of the districts – Macomia and Quissanga – hardest-hit by Cyclone Kenneth.

Both drought and floods have negatively impacted children’s well-being and their access to education. The government reports that Cyclone Kenneth damaged at least 480 classrooms, affecting close to 42,000 children. Meanwhile,

Cyclone Idai damaged more than 2,800 classrooms. In addition, many children have been displaced away from their homes and schools, and many schools were initially used as collective centres for the displaced, rendering them non-functional for educational purposes. Although school has resumed in most of the affected areas, many classrooms are still damaged and in need of immediate repair and rehabilitation. In the drought-affected areas, poor concentration in class due to hunger and thirst was reported and shortage of water led to migration of the most vulnerable rural families, causing their children to drop out of school.

There are also reports of significant psychosocial support needs amongst children following the cyclones.

Extensive damage to key roads and bridges, has compromised people’s access to services and basic supplies.

The impact of cyclones Kenneth and Idai resulted in many people being unable to move freely due to the persistence of flood waters and damaged road networks. Key roads in each of the affected areas were cut for significant periods.

After Cyclone Idai, for example, the N6 was cut, leaving Beira City cut-off and disabling a key supply route in the country. In Nhamatanda, people were isolated between the Zimbabwean border and the flood-affected areas. Food prices reportedly rose by more than 100 per cent in some affected areas and transport costs in the limited accessible areas have either doubled or tripled. Poor families, who lost everything in the floods, were unable to purchase basic items. After Cyclone Kenneth, the roads to Metuge town, Mucojo Sede in Macomia, and other areas were inaccessible. The isolation of communites increases the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, as boys, girls and families become desperate for livesaving resources such as food, shelter and water. It is critical that the response reduces the risk of exploitation.

The humanitarian situation is compounded by high levels of poverty, as well as the Government’s limited fiscal space to respond effectively. Despite a downward trend in the incidence of poverty over the years, the number of poor people remains high and inequality is growing. Both Cyclones Kenneth and Idai are expected to exacerbate this situation, as recent poverty analysis conducted in Mozambique shows that cyclone, flood or drought can lead to a drop of up to 25 to 30 per cent in per capita food consumption and that affected households also cut back on expenditures in basic non-food items. The rain-dependent agricultural sector -which accounts for around 25 per cent of Mozambique’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs nearly 75 per cent of the labour force- has been hard-hit by Cyclone Idai.

This revised Humanitarian Response Plan will enable response to the most immediate and life-saving needs arising from Cyclone Idai over a three month period, along with sustained response to the pre-existing needs in drought-affected areas. It will also allow partners to immediately kick-start crucial recovery actions to begin restoring livelihoods and self-reliance, which will continue beyond the three-month horizon. Over the coming three months, the humanitarian community will review the situation, with the Government, to determine next steps, while simultaneously engaging with development partners to urge rapid action to tackle the longer-term issues resulting from the storm, including reconstruction and recovery",2019-05-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'revised', 'response', 'plan', 'idai', 'humanitarian', 'cyclone', 'following', 'including', 'kenneth', 'cyclones', 'access', '2019', 'food', 'landfall', 'areas', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English

By Vatican News staff writer

Volunteers and workers of Caritas Vietnam are visiting and assisting people in the central provinces who have to face the brunt of 13 storms this year with some severe flooding.

The umpteenth storm

In just over a month, Vietnam's central region has seen 7 tropical storms and typhoons, causing floods and landslides that killed 235 people and caused an estimated $740,000 in damage in several provinces. The rain from the storms has caused the worst flooding in the region in more than 30 years.

The latest of these typhoons, Vamco, made landfall in Vietnam on Sunday with winds of up to 150 kph, after leaving 67 dead in the Philippines. The storm has damaged more than 400,000 homes, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. At least 150,000 people are at risk of going hungry.

According to Caritas, the social arm of the Catholic Church, rebuilding homes and recovering their livelihood are extremely important apart from immediate help and survival. Farming, such as growing vegetables, rice, raising livestock and poultry, which is the mainstay in the central provinces, has been devastated. Many families have lost everything in the floods and landslides.



Local Caritas in action

The new director of Caritas Vietnam, Father Joseph Ngo Si Dinh, led a delegation to the central provinces, Nov. 9-11, to survey the flooded areas. They first visited the Diocese of Hu? and its two adjoining provinces, talking to families and providing them material and spiritual support.

Father John Nguyen Huy Tuan, director of Caritas Ha Tinh, said priests were actively involved in bringing food and relief to the affected people and moving them to safer places.

Temporary shelters have been built to accommodate 25 families. A parish mobilised its young people to rescue families trapped in flooded homes.

No one excluded

Caritas Vietnam, in collaboration with dioceses and parishes, has been engaged in social outreach and charity works to help people after natural disasters.

The social arm of the Catholic Church assists people to rebuild their lives, repair damaged houses and build new homes for families who have lost theirs. It also provides people and families with seeds, livestock, water filtering systems, and finance for school children.

Caritas discussed ways to come up with concrete plans or projects to rebuild the lives of people regardless of their religion. Father Dinh has urged Catholics to help every person in need. We hope that the people most affected by these storms, be they Catholic or not, will get some relief, the Caritas director said.",2020-11-17 08:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'storms', 'provinces', 'flood', 'caritas', 'social', 'homes', 'central', 'region', 'families', 'typhoons', 'storm', 'victims', 'assisting']",Vietnam,news article,English
926,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Manitoba spent big money to fight flooding. Could its solutions work in Eastern Canada? - CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-spent-big-money-to-fight-flooding-could-its-solutions-work-in-eastern-canada-1.5117566,"As parts of Eastern Canada struggle with record flood levels, Winnipeg is unusually dry. That's partly because of a long, slow spring melt, but also because of major investments in dikes, dams, diversions — and something called Duff's Ditch.

It raises the question: Could Manitoba's flood-protection solutions work elsewhere in Canada?

To answer that, we first have to understand the recent history of flooding and infrastructure investment on the Red River, one of the few in North America that flows north.

In 1950, the Red River inundated one-eighth of Winnipeg. In low-lying areas, the water was 4.6 metres deep. It forced 100,000 residents from their homes.

""You only have to look at the pictures from 1950 to know that having that happen again to the city of Winnipeg wasn't an option,"" said Jay Doering, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Manitoba.

So, after more than a decade of debate and studies, Manitoba constructed a 47-kilometre, $63-million ditch, known as the Winnipeg Floodway, to divert floodwater and spit it out safely back into the river on the north side of the city. Now known as the Red River Floodway, it's also sometimes called Duff's Ditch, after then-premier Duff Roblin.

Pumping stations and 114 kilometres of dikes were also built within the city.

WATCH | See how bad the flooding got in Manitoba in 1950

See how bad the flooding got in Manitoba in 1950 CBC News 0:58 That flood eventually led to the creation of the Red River floodway, which has saved the province billions 0:58

In the 1970s, the province constructed a $30-million diversion channel and reservoir on the Assiniboine River to keep water out of the city from the west.

Then came 1997 and the Flood of the Century. It was substantially larger than the 1950 flood, but resulted in far less property damage because of the flood-control measures in place. Still, it strained the floodway's capacity.

The overflowing Red River became the largest in North America, covering an area the size of Prince Edward Island.

Doering says it was another wake-up call ""that we probably didn't have the level of protection that the city of Winnipeg needs.""

So, another $630 million was spent to expand the floodway. It's now meant to defend the city against a one-in-700 year flood.

Before 1997, eight communities in the Red River Valley were protected by ring dikes. After that flood, an additional eight were built.

""Whether it's climate change or whether it's just normal events, the reality is we have these events and they're not going to go away, so we need to look at options for protecting communities so that the damages are minimized, the anguish is minimized,"" said Chris Hamblin, deputy mayor of Morris, a town south of Winnipeg along the Red River that's surrounded by a ring dike.

""When you see the damages and the millions of dollars to get those people back to their normal life states, you know the investment isn't as big as it is it seems.""

The main highway connecting the United States and Winnipeg was raised to protect it from flooding.

Homeowners were told to rebuild in accordance with flood-protection standards or they would not be eligible for compensation after any future floods.

Jay Doering, professor of civil engineering at the University of Manitoba, says the Red River Floodway is an example of engineering genius that has paid for itself many times over. (Courtesy of Jay Doering/University of Manitoba)

The thinking was: ""We can't keep compensating. We need to be proactive on managing floods in the Red River Valley,"" Doering said.

There have been two major floods since 1997. Both times, Winnipeg stayed largely dry.

As of 2013, the floodway had saved an estimated $32 billion in damages, according to the Manitoba Floodway Authority and a 2014 TD Economics report.

That means it has paid for itself 40 times over, and counting.

""That would be a large amount of money in roughly 1960 dollars, and at the time, Premier Duff Roblin took a lot of heat for those investments. But when we reflect back now on the billions and billions of dollars that they have mitigated, obviously it was a visionary move,"" Doering said.

""We have come a long way in terms of being proactive with our floods, keeping the communities and keeping the city of Winnipeg protected.""

But could it work elsewhere?

Last week, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs raised the idea of constructing a type of floodway at the south end of the St. John River. He's looking into a preliminary assessment to determine whether a spillway would make sense.

""We can do something in the Saint John area to spill more water out into the Bay [of Fundy],"" he told CBC News.

""It could be a tunnel pipeline that would be able to connect around the falls and directly to the bay.""

Area residents were ferried to their homes in Darlings Island, N.B., on Saturday. The area is cut off when the Kennebecasis River, a tributary of the Saint John River, rises above the road leading to the community. (Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press)

A spillway could work structurally, says Slobodan Simonovic, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Western Ontario who spent much of his career in Manitoba and lived through the 1997 flood.

However, he says, cities in New Brunswick may not have enough population to justify the infrastructure cost that has made economic sense in Winnipeg.

""That kind of cost-benefit ratio would be very different.""

The Ottawa River Valley, meanwhile, has a different set of problems to consider: too many communities to protect and hydropower development that conflicts with flood control. Any changes would also affect the St. Lawrence River.

""I don't think that a single structural solution will work in that particular area,"" Simonovic said, especially considering there are also jurisdictional complications in dealing with two provinces, Ontario and Quebec, and two countries, the U.S. and Canada.

Cities like Montreal can get some useful ideas from Manitoba's network of dams, dikes and diversions, but ""finding the best way of managing the system and co-ordinating among different players will be definitely the solution,"" Simonovic said.

Calgary is also dealing with flood mitigation and protection projects.

Moving to higher ground

With flood threats becoming more common and more costly, Simonovic says the only solution for some cities may be to move people out of flood plains.

What's important, he says, is politicians should not wait for the next disaster, but ""use the time in between to come up with the solutions that will be minimizing the future impacts.""

Jay Doering agrees. He says at-risk communities need to be forward-thinking.

""They need to ask what level of compensation is being paid out? What's the cumulative compensation and what might we do now to be proactive in order to offset that?

""Because I would suggest to you that compensation alone for flood after flood after flood is not a plan.""

Last week, Quebec Premier François Legault said homeowners with flood-damaged properties would be eligible for up to $100,000 in compensation. But beyond that, the government would offer a maximum of $200,000 to buy the property.

""We cannot [offer] every year compensation to solve problems, but only on a temporary basis,"" he said. ""We really need incentives to move the people when it's happening every year or almost.""",2019-05-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['money', 'manitoba', 'red', 'eastern', 'flooding', 'spent', 'flood', 'floodway', 'winnipeg', 'fight', 'city', 'doering', 'work', 'compensation', 'river', 'big', 'solutions', 'canada', 'need']",Canada,news article,English

Billiton REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes

London's Court of Appeal will hear a request to revive a 5 billion pound ($6.95 billion) lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining group BHP (BHPB.L), (BHP.AX) over a 2015 dam failure in Brazil, a court order showed.

Judge Nicholas Underhill has agreed to an oral hearing that could help to overturn a previous Court of Appeal decision which denied a 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group permission to appeal against a judgment to strike out the landmark case.

""I am satisfied that, exceptionally, an oral hearing is appropriate in this case,"" the judge said in the order, which was signed on May 4 and seen by Reuters on Thursday.

No further details were immediately available.

The order comes less than two months after the Court of Appeal refused permission for a lawsuit over Brazil's worst environmental disaster to proceed in English courts. read more

The Court of Appeal said in March it agreed with a lower court that the case was an abuse of process, that claimants could - and were - making reparation claims in Brazil and that the lawsuit would be ""irredeemably unmanageable"".

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale (VALE3.SA), killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

Samarco has since filed for bankruptcy protection.

PGMBM, the law firm representing the Brazilian claimants, said it had been contacted by many clients to ""express their gratitude in respect of the consideration being given by the Court of Appeal to their application.""

BHP, the world's largest miner by market value, said it was aware of the application.

""Previous (court) rulings ... have supported our position that the civil claim proceedings were unnecessary as they duplicated matters already covered by the existing and ongoing work of the Renova Foundation and are, or have been, the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in Brazil,"" a BHP spokesman said.

The Renova Foundation is a redress scheme established in 2016 by BHP's Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale.

The case is the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) over oil spills in the Niger Delta. read more

ighty-year-old Christina Alooâ??s thin legs lie straight out as she sits up on a mattress in the corner of a dark classroom scattered with other peopleâ??s belongings.

â??I canâ??t walk,â? she says. â??The floodwater came into my mud house at night and my grandson picked me up and helped me to escape.â?

Kenya is experiencing some of the worst flooding for generations, adding a third layer of crisis to a nation buckled by the threat of Covid-19 and battling a massive locust invasion that is destroying vast areas of crops.

About 233,000 people have been affected by the floods, including more than 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross, after record-breaking rains caused rivers to burst their banks, devastating towns and villages.

In the west of the country, Africaâ??s largest inland body of water, Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, is at its highest level ever recorded â?? 13.42 metres â?? and has enveloped whole villages around its shores.

The Kenyan government says 237 people who were unable to escape the water have died from the flooding.

â??These are the worst floods Iâ??ve ever seen, weâ??ve lost everything,â? says Aloo, who has a breathing condition that causes shortness of breath when there is humidity in the air.

Schools in Kenya were closed in March because of fears of the spread of Covid-19. Now more than 100 are full again, packed with families whose makeshift houses are flooded or completely destroyed by water.

Social distancing is not possible for the hundreds, like Aloo, sleeping on classroom floors in Nyambare Secondary School in Siaya County.

Outside in the schoolyard, James Owende is shouting desperately in the middle of a tight circle of onlookers.

â??My house was drowned. All my animals â?? my cows, my hens, my goats have all drowned. I canâ??t work,â? he says. Owende earned a living by digging sand, used for construction, out of the lake, but the mines have been overwhelmed.

For many in the area, it is the only source of income. â??Iâ??m just begging the government, they have to do something for me.â?

â??We need food,â? someone in the crowd calls. â??We need houses,â??â?? says another.

The Kenya Red Cross is giving out emergency food parcels and basic living items such as pots, pans, thick plastic sheets to make temporary shelters, face masks and mosquito nets.

Last Sunday, Kenyaâ??s president, Uhuru Kennyatta, said the government is dispatching 250m Kenyan shillings (Â£190,000) every week to vulnerable families impacted by the economic crisis and 1bn shillings has been set aside for flood control measures, he said.

James Okumbe, deputy governor of Siaya county, told The Independent about plans, which have been delayed, to build a dam and dykes to control the flow of rivers that burst their banks.

â??It could have been finished, but the national government has not completed the compensation of the landowners [who need to be relocated and] live along the river banksâ?, says Okumbe.

The unknown threat of Covid-19 hangs over the displaced and defenceless communities.

â??Iâ??m worried about corona,â? Owende continues. â??Kids are asking their mothers: â??Mum am I going to die?â??â?

Kenya has recorded 63 deaths from Covid-19 and 1,888 confirmed cases, as of Saturday. Movement has been restricted in and out of big cities and a national 7pm to 5am dusk-until-dawn curfew has been enforced, with police using violence and teargas.

Informal labourers make up 83.6 per cent of the Kenyan workforce, many of whom are struggling to find work in an economy on its knees.

â??This is the worst business we have ever had,â? says Eddie Ochieng, who gives boat rides to tourists in the port city of Kisumu on the shores of the vast lake.

Even if riverside hotels werenâ??t submerged, they would be largely empty. Kenyaâ??s tourist industry evaporated when international flights were grounded on 25 March, leaving tens of thousands of jobs in jeopardy.

People are really suffering, says Ochieng, who is also living in school: â??Floods arenâ??t unusual in this region, but normally the water doesnâ??t wash away houses then stay high for weeks.â?

Weather scientists point to global warming to explain the increasing frequency of record-breaking climate systems over the past decade.

Guleid Artan, director of the Nairobi-based Climate Prediction and Application Centre, explains that the higher temperatures in the western Indian ocean heat water and suck moisture into the atmosphere; this moisture is then dumped over the higher ground in east Africa, causing record-breaking rainfall.

â??Now there is more water going into the lake than coming out,â? says Artan. The land is saturated with water and â??rivers leading out of the lake are also full, so the water gets backed up,â? he says.

On Lake Victoriaâ??s shores in Uganda, chunks of farmland have broken away to form floating islands and have been clogging dams that generate much of east Africaâ??s power and drain the lake.

Stepping from a road into a long wooden boat in Debani, Busia County, Gertrude Nerima explains that her mud house has been destroyed. Sheâ??s going to stay with some friends with her husband and four children.

Bony cows perch on a dry spit of grass surrounded by water and roads taper off into the new shores of the muddy lake.

Like tens of thousands of others around the lake, Nerima is homeless. Her small farm and recently planted crops have been completely swept away.

â??Iâ??ll have to rebuild my house and replant crops when the water goes down in the next couple of weeks, and weâ??ll try to get back to normal.â?

Around her feet, the flood can be seen sliding backwards â?? inland towards a river.

The World Meteorological Organisation has warned that above-normal rainfall is predicted between June and September in the region.

In Homa Bay county, 100km away, Owiena Hezekiah, assistant chief of Kogembo tells The Independent: â??This is the worst situation that the community has experienced â?? the worst.â?

â??Three villages in the area are now partially underwater. There are more mosquitoes which cause malaria and aggressive hippos have come inland,â? he says.

â??We are worried about sanitation and cholera. People relied on pit latrines which are now overflowing with water.â?

On the floor in Nyambare Secondary School, Aloo says the community needs to build houses on higher ground. â??I worry about younger generations. We canâ??t keep living in these areas, but without government support we have no choice,â? she says.

In the classroom next door, which is now home to 20 people, Kennedy Oduor sits with his wife and eight children.

â??Iâ??m stressed. My life is broken now; I canâ??t work and I have nowhere to live,â??â?? he says. â??Our fathers and grandfathers have lived by this lake, but itâ??s getting too dangerous. The problem is we donâ??t have money to buy land so there is nowhere else to go.â?",2020-06-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['lake', 'locust', 'school', 'houses', 'reeling', 'living', 'covid19', 'county', 'swarms', 'water', 'kenya', 'worst', 'flooding', 'house', 'communities', 'devastates', 'generations']",Kenya,news article,English
701,Drought Sri Lanka,Summer cola war hots up early - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/management/summer-cola-war-hots-up-early-113021900810_1.html,"PepsiCo India seems to have fired the first salvo in the impending cola war for the summer of 2013. The beverage major, which has the title rights for the sixth season of IPL 20-20 tournament, is close to sewing up the pouring rights with eight of the nine teams in the fray, other than Mumbai Indians. This gives PepsiCo right to sell and promote their portfolio of products in the home stadium of each team.

Cola Cola India has a multiple-year contract with Mumbai Indians, with Sachin Tendulkar being one of the celeb brand ambassadors.

Last year, Coca Cola had pouring rights with five teams – Mumbai Indians, Delhi Daredevils, Kolkata Knight Riders, Hyderabad Deccan Chargers, Kings XI Punjab - while rival PepsiCo had the pouring rights for Rajasthan Royals, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sahara Pune Warrior, Chennai Super Kings.

When contacted, a PepsiCo India spokesperson said: “Our activation plans and other partnership including pouring rights are under discussion.” Some of the IPL team managers said on condition of anonymity that they were close to signing on the dotted line.

Teams typically charge anywhere between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1.5 crore for pouring rights, depending on the level of engagement with the sponsor. Apart from pouring rights, PepsiCo is likely to enter into separate sponsorship deals with each of the teams that would entail them use of brand logo in players’ dress, or right to use players for promotion of events, etc. “Each deal is different depending on the package they mutually agree on,” said a commercial manager of one of the teams.

PepsiCo own the IPL title rights for five years for Rs 397 crore in November last year, adding fizz to the Cola battle. The sixth season of IPL tournament – scheduled for April-May - falls right at the start of the peak summer season, a period that accounts for 40-45 per cent of soft drink sales in the country.

This year the battle among the cola players started early on in January. PepsiCo rolled out its “Oh Yes Abhi” campaign starring Ranbir Kapoor, MS Dhoni and Priyanka Chopra. Coca-Cola India ushered in the New Year with its 'Crazy for Happiness' brand campaign in January. Last month, PepsiCo roped in Hrithik as the new brand ambassador for Mountain Dew, in place of Salman Khan, who moved on to be the face of Cola Cola’s Thums Up. “We want to further enhance visibility of the brand and are looking forward to a blockbuster summer,” a Pepsico spokesperson said without giving details of the campaign starring Hrithik Roshan.

In an unlikely move, Coca Cola rolled out a campaign for its mango drink, Maaza, in the winter months with Bollywood stars Imran Khan and Parineeta Chopra, with the tag line “Har Mausam Love, Har Mausam Aam”. However, the advertising fraternity expects the firework to lighten up in the battle among the cola majors when Salman Khan hits the screen this summer as the new face of Thums Up.

As a run-up to the Salman Khan campaign, early last week Coca Cola launched a road show – Thums Up Jalsa – that would hit 400 towns and cities across the country. “This is one of our largest consumer connect initiative for rural India,” a company spokesperson said. The soft drink major plans to roll out a nationwide campaign with Salman Khan and with South superhero Mahesh Babu in Andhra Pradesh, in the summer of 2013.

The battle between the two cola majors for larger share of consumer mind space and the spending pie, typically reaches a crescendo in the summer months from March-end to early July. Each year the two cola majors cumulatively spend around Rs 350-400 crore on advertising, and promotion, around 55 per cent of which is earmarked for the summer months.

“They are make-or-break months for both the players,” said Sridhar Ramanujam, founder-CEO, Brand-Comm, a Bangalore-based brand consulting firm. He expects overall advertising spend this summer to be more than that of summer of 2012.

The $8billion (Rs 45,000-Rs 50,000 crore) liquid refrigerated beverage market in India – around half of which is carbonated soft drinks - is marked by low per capita consumption. According to Ministry of Food Processing and Industry, per capita consumption level in India is 5-6 bottles compared to 17 bottles in Pakistan, 21 bottles in Sri Lanka, 73 bottles in Thailand, 173 bottles in Phillipines and 605 bottles in Mexico. “The summers are best time to grow the market and deepen the penetration,” said a senior executive from one of the cola companies. IPL6 will only add fizz to that battle.",2013-02-19 08:00:00+00:00,"['pepsico', 'india', 'summer', 'rs', 'campaign', 'brand', 'bottles', 'hots', 'cola', 'early', 'rights', 'pouring', 'war']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

NEW YORK - Americans on Sunday remembered the horror of Sept 11, 2001, and the nearly 3,000 people who died in the hijacked plane attacks as authorities worked to ensure the emotional 10th anniversary was peaceful.

President Barack Obama and former president George W. Bush stood in silence on Sunday and a church bell rang twice at the precise moment ten years after the first jetliner struck the World Trade Center.

Obama read Psalm 46 that reminds the faithful that God is a refuge and strength that dwells in ""his city.""

Bush read a civil war letter from president Abraham Lincoln to a mother who lost all five of her sons.

As cellist Yo Yo Ma played mournful background music, relatives of the Sept 11 dead began entering a transformed Ground Zero, the centerpiece of a day of mourning and remembrance around the nation and world to mark 10 years since the worst terrorist attack on American soil.

The heart of the ceremony to consecrate the memorial began with the reading of the names of nearly 3,000 people who died in the attacks.

The memorial opens to the public on Monday. It sits next to a construction project where office towers, a transportation hub and a cultural center are taking shape. The signature skyscraper, One World Trade Center, is rising quickly and will be the tallest in the country when completed.

Thousands gathered on a clear Sunday morning to grieve where the twin towers of the World Trade Center once stood. With security high and no traffic, there was an eerie silence where a decade ago the 110-storey skyscrapers collapsed after being hit by hijacked airliners, sending a cloud over lower Manhattan.

The somber ceremony - with bagpipes, youthful voices singing the national anthem and firefighters holding aloft a tattered American flag retrieved from Ground Zero - drew tears. Family members wore T-shirts with the faces of the dead, carried photos, flowers and flags in an outpouring of emotion.

For the first time, relatives saw the just-finished memorial and touched the etched names of their dead loved ones. Some left flowers, others small teddy bears. Some used pencils to trace the names on paper, others took a photograph.

Many wept as the names of the dead were read, by wives and husbands, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers and children, some choked with emotion at their personal loss.

""I haven't stopped missing my dad. He was awesome,"" said Peter Negron, who was just a child when his father, Pete, was killed in one of the stricken towers. ""I wish my dad had been there to teach me how to drive, ask a girl out on a date and see me graduate from high school and a hundred other things I can't even begin to name.""

The al-Qaida attacks of 2001 are now such a part of American life that they have been included in the school curriculum. This was the first anniversary that included a US president.

The memorial includes two plazas in the shape of the footprints of the Twin Towers with cascading 9-meter waterfalls. Around the perimeters of pools in the center of each plaza are the names of the victims of the Sept 11 attacks and an earlier 1993 attack at the trade center.

""Ten years have passed since a perfect blue sky morning turned into the blackest of nights,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said during the ceremony.

""Since then, we've lived in sunshine and in shadow, and although we can never unsee what happened here, we can also see that children who lost their parents have grown into young adults, grandchildren have been born and good works and public service have taken root to honor those we loved and lost.""

Obama visited the North Memorial Pool, which sits in the footprint of the north tower. He walked around the pool hand-in-hand with first lady Michelle Obama, former president George W. Bush and his wife, Laura.

In a somber moment, Obama touched the names of the dead, engraved in stone, before he greeted some family members.

Police in New York and Washington were on high alert against a ""credible but unconfirmed"" threat of an al-Qaida plot to attack the US again on the 10th anniversary.

Security was especially tight in Manhattan, where police set up vehicle checks on city streets as well as bridges and tunnels coming into the city. There was an unprecedented show of force in Manhattan from roadblocks on Times Square in midtown to the area around Ground Zero farther to the south.

""It was our Pearl Harbor,"" said John McGillicuddy, 33, a teacher from Yonkers, New York, getting coffee and carrying two American flags on his way to the World Trade Center, referring to the Japanese attack that led America to join World War II.

""Every year, September is always rough,"" he said, as he prepared to grieve his uncle, Lieutenant Joseph Leavey, a New York firefighter who died in the south tower.

Pope Benedict prayed for Sept 11 victims and appealed to those with grievances to ""always reject violence as a solution to problems and resist the temptation to resort to hate"".

In the Sept 11 attacks, 19 men hijacked airliners and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon outside Washington and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Just weeks after the attacks, US forces invaded Afghanistan to topple that country's Taliban rulers who had harbored the al-Qaida leaders responsible for the Sept 11 attacks.

Obama was set to visit all three attack sites on Sunday.

""There should be no doubt: today, America is stronger and al-Qaida is on the path to defeat,"" Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday.

In Afghanistan, NATO-led forces said on Sunday that on the eve of the 10th anniversary a suicide bomber driving a truck of firewood attacked a NATO base in central Afghanistan in an operation for which the Taliban later claimed responsibility.

NATO said that the Saturday afternoon attack killed four Afghan civilians and injured 77 NATO troops.

US forces killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May.

Sunday's Ground Zero ceremony had moments of silence marking when the planes hit the twin towers as well as when they collapsed. Other moments of silence marked when a plane hit the Pentagon and another crashed in Shanksville after passengers fought back against the hijackers.

Sunday's ceremony was the biggest of a weekend of such events from coast to coast.

A decade later, after a faltering start, there are signs of rebuilding progress at the World Trade Center. The new One World Trade Center rises more than 80 stories above the ground as it inches to its planned 541 meters height, or 1,776 feet - symbolic of the year America declared independence from Britain.

1167,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Nigeria Loses a Quarter of Rice Production to Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigeria-loses-quarter-rice-production-floods,"ARGUNGU - Farmers in northern Nigeria have lost more than two million tons of rice, a quarter of the country's projected harvest, due to flooding. Despite the loss, Nigeria is so far upholding a year-long ban on land-based imports of rice to crack down on smuggling and boost local production.

Ibrahim Adullahi is looking at what remains of his 350-hectare rice farm in Nigerias Kebbi state.

Abdullahi was expecting a harvest of 600 tons of rice, but weeks of severe flooding means he will be lucky to get 100.

Since when I started farming, I have never experienced intensive cultivation of rice like now, because a lot of people are into the rice farming. But unfortunately, we experienced this intensive flooding that we are still experiencing now, and farmers are now counting losses because 90 percent of our farmers have lost what they have cultivated, he said.

Nigerias biggest rice producing state, Kebbi, had projected 2.5 million tons this year.

But heavy September rains washed away two million tons. Local rice miller Mohammad Anuana said this could cause a further jump in the price of the grain.

If rain has already washed away all the farm product, you know the goods will be rising up (in price) because the little one they have on ground - they will make sure they recover (the value of) the one that the water moves away. And, so theyll double the price, he said.

With Africas largest population, Nigeria annually imports billions of dollars of rice and wheat. But the country hopes to become self-sufficient.

Last year, the government banned land-based rice imports to crack down on smuggling and boost local rice production.

Despite the lost rice, the Nigerian officials say the ban will remain in place.

Chairman of the All Farmers Association in Nigeria John Wuyep said affected farmers will be compensated.

""The government and even the financial institutions have a machinery in force. So many who have lost now are already preparing for the dry season farming, he said.

Nigerias farmers association says better groundwork is needed to prevent flooding and have a steady water supply during the dry season.

Flood reduction would also help save homes and the displacement of thousands of Nigerians from overflowing rivers.",2020-09-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'production', 'lost', 'flooding', 'local', 'quarter', 'price', 'tons', 'floods', 'million', 'nigeria', 'imports', 'loses', 'rice']",Nigeria,news article,English

Express News Service

CHENNAI: Tonnes of plastic waste is piling-up near river mouths in Chennai posing serious threat to aquatic life. With the entire state government machinery busy with the containment of coronavirus spread,

there isn't proper clean-up leading to the crisis-like situation.

A visit to the broken bridge area near Adyar Estuary will tell you how grave the situation is. A large portion of the estuary surface and its river bed is covered by plastic debris waiting to make their way into

the sea.

Pet bottles, parcel containers, wrappers, plastic bags, disposed face masks and gloves are found at the river bed. The situation is equally bad near the Cooum river mouth and Kovalam river mouth.

A city-based artist, B Gowtham, a young eco-warrior who created a majestic whale lying on the sands of Besant Nagar Beach using thrown away plastic bottle caps, said: ""I feel the per-capita consumption of

plastics has increased during the lockdown with people preferring to order online lot more food and groceries. The parcel material that is used consists of mostly plastic, which is adding to the problem.""

Gowtham, who designed corona helmets and autos for traffic police to spread awareness, said the general public needs to act responsibly. ""Taking special permission, I undertake 'Walk for Plastic' daily in my

locality and collect approximately 250 pieces of plastic and 40 per cent of the waste is discarded face masks. This is an irresponsible behavior. I find many morning joggers simply littering the pet bottles

on the road. The city corporation personnel are all busy with Covid-19 works and we can't expect them to carry out clean-up during the pandemic,"" he said.

Joe K Kizhakudan, officer-in-charge, Kovalam Field Laboratory, Central Marine Research Institute (CMFRI), said this is a recurring problem. ""Once the monsoon rains begin, all the accumulated plastic waste in the river mouths will enter the ocean. Plastic wreaks havoc on marine ecosystems. As plastic swirls around in the water, much of it breaks down to tiny pieces called microplastics and is consumed by fish species,"" he said.

The New India Express has reported recently on how unscientific disposal of face masks and gloves not only pose potential health risk during the pandemic but also contain materials that do not recycle and

are not biodegradable.

589,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Corruption Getting Worse in Africa - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907120429.html,"More than half of all citizens surveyed in 35 countries across the African Continent think that corruption is getting worse in their respective countries, while less than quarter perceived that the fight against corruption is getting better, according to the Global Corruption Barometer in collaboration with Afro barometer.

The Report, which was released Thursday, July 11, 2019 shows that more than one in four people who accessed public services such as healthcare and education, paid bribe in the previous year.

That, according to the report is equivalent to 130 million people across the region as per the sampling of 47, 000 citizens in 35 countries.

The report also highlighted that corruption disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, with the poorest paying bribes twice as often as the richest, while young people pay more bribe than those over 55 years.

The survey found among other things that corruption is on the rise and many governments are failing to do enough, whereas concerns about the integrity of public officials remain high. It further found that Bribery demands are regular occurrence for many.

Addressing the media at the launch of the Report in Accra, Mrs Mary Awelana Addah, Programmes Manager of the Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII),a Local Chapter of Transparency International explained that in Ghana, the focus area of the survey included the bribery rates, changes in the level of corruption, participation of ordinary people in the fight against corruption, corruption by institutions and whether government is doing good or bad job of fighting corruption.

Regarding Citizens perception by Institutions, Mr Addah said 59 percent of the respondent perceive the Ghana Police Service to be the most corrupt institution followed by judges and magistrates 38 percent and Government Officials were third with 35 percent.

Parliament and members of Parliament were cited as the fourth most corrupt institution in Ghana according to 32 percent of the people surveyed.

She told the media that getting citizens to report persons to the appropriate authorities has been very difficult in spite of the passage of laws that guarantee protection and rewards proactive reporting.

She indicated that 60 percent of citizens surveyed said government was doing a good job with the fight against corruption while 30 percent thought government is not doing well.

""It is worthy of mention that 60 percent of respondents believe ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption,"" she added.

The GII per the revelations in the Report recommended that the state must intensify its efforts in the fight against corruption by adequately resourcing the key anti-corruption institutions to discharge their mandate. It also recommended that the Office of the Special Prosecutor should fast track investigations and prosecutions of many corruption cases pending and also make the public aware per section 3(3) of the Act establishing the Office of the Special Prosecutor as the level of confidence in the Office is gradually waning.

It added that the state should wean itself of the growing phenomenon of attacks on media personalities to allow the media to effectively hold policy accountable and provide the sources for and platform for civil society to hold their duty bearers accountable.",2019-07-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'public', 'institutions', 'citizens', 'media', 'fight', 'report', 'office', 'getting', 'corruption', 'ghana', 'worse']",Ghana,news article,English
687,Drought Sri Lanka,Rainy season threatens transitional housing in Sri Lanka - Woman News Network (WNN) - WNN - Women News Network,https://womennewsnetwork.net/2012/11/02/transitional-housing-sri-lanka/,"WNN Improve It

(WNN/IRIN) Kilinochchi, SRI LANKA: Standing outside her battle-scarred home in northern Sri Lanka, Thangeswary Karuppaiyah dreams of one day rebuilding it. “I hope it’s soon. That’s what we are waiting for,” said the 55-year-old grandmother.

She has been living in a “transitional shelter” a few metres from her old home for the past three years.

Made of tin sheeting, coconut leaves and tarpaulins, it was put up by her family (thanks to government and international aid) following her return in 2009, and was designed to last two years – time enough to rebuild her old house, say aid workers.

“People have been in transitional shelter for a long time, in many cases three years… With the rainy season starting, things are going to become tough for those people,” Fontini Rantsiou, head of the northern sub-office of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.

Thousands of former IDPs are even less fortunate than Thangeswary, have never received any assistance, and live in makeshift shacks made of plastic sheeting and anything else they can get hold of.

“This is probably the most pressing issue of all. Under Sphere standards, transitional shelter in good condition offers some semblance of protection,” an international aid worker who asked not to be identified, explained. “Unfortunately, many people still don’t even have that.”

More than three years after Sri Lanka’s decades-long war came to an end and the return of nearly 470,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) to the north, thousands of people remain in flimsy shelters, say UN sources.

There is insufficient data to illustrate the severity of the problem, as the government has never endorsed a comprehensive needs assessment suggested by aid organizations in mid-2012, said a report by the International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) published on 31 October.

As a result, humanitarian organizations have only managed to collect limited information.

Across Sri Lanka’s former northern war zone (locally known as the Vanni), only 26 percent of IDP returnee families have received transitional shelter assistance, the report said, citing inputs from shelter agencies, including the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

Of the more than 100,000 families in need of transitional shelter assistance in four northern districts (Vavuniya, Mullaitvu, Kilinochchi, and Manner), just 26,000 received assistance, leaving an estimated theoretical gap of around 74,000, according to UNHCR October figures.

Moreover, in at least three of the villages in Mullaitivu District which opened up for returns between July and September 2012, no commitments have been made to provide any transitional shelters at all, the IDMC report said, with only half the requirement for transitional shelters being met in Kilinochchi District.

Many of those affected have no choice but to live in makeshift shelters they have constructed themselves – well below internationally accepted Sphere standards.

Meanwhile, international funding for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka is drying up, largely because the World Bank now classifies the island nation as a middle-income country at peace, though government restrictions on assessments are preventing an adequate response, the IDMC report said.

A further obstacle is that many agencies and donors are reluctant to fund additional transitional shelter work given the high expectation of a commitment by donors to construct more than 75,000 permanent houses in the north – a project which could take years to complete.

According to OCHA, donors and the government are currently committed to supporting the building and repair of more than 35,000 houses (excluding Indian government plans to build 49,000 houses) against total needs in excess of 100,000.

805,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Rising sea levels threaten Egyptian coasts - Al-Monitor,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2018/12/coasts-environement-climate-change-egypt-floods-emergency.html,"CAIRO — Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohammad Abdel Ati announced a state of emergency Dec. 7 after a storm surge flooded the coastline in the governorate of Kafr El Sheikh.

The incident alarmed the state, which worried that climate change is contributing to rising sea levels and eroding Egypt's coasts.

In a Dec. 11 media statement, the head of the Egyptian Public Authority for Shore Protection, Mahmoud Saadi, said the authority has started implementing three projects to protect the coasts of Kafr El Sheikh, starting with the protection of the Kitchener Drain and the coastal area north of the fish farm in Berket Ghalyoun as a first step. This is in addition to coastline protection, including beach nourishment in the Shark al-Rous area, to the east of the basin. The Kitchener Drain, also known as the Gharbia Drain, passes through Gharbia, Kafr El Sheikh and Dakhalia governorates, with the majority of it in Gharbia.

Saadi said the authority is making great efforts to build new breakwaters in a bid to keep waves that have exceeded 5.5 meters (18 feet) at bay as well as to replenish beach sand and prevent the sea from further eroding the coast.

The cost of the three projects, aimed at protecting the northern coast of the governorate and stretching over 28 kilometers (17 miles), is 250 million Egyptian pounds (about $14 million), according to a Dec. 11 statement from Kafr El Sheikh governorate.

Kafr El Sheikh Gov. Ismail Abdel Hamid told Al-Monitor that the governorate has managed to protect several towns from further flood damage following the storm surge.

The beaches of the Baltim resort and other towns were nourished with sand.

He added that the governorate has been preparing every year for such incidents, given that Kafr El Sheikh’s coastal areas are threatened with inundation as a result of climate change. He said towns along the coastline were not built much above sea level and therefore are threatened with flooding.

The governor also said Kafr El Sheikh is an agricultural governorate and that the sea water in the recent flooding made its way into the Abu Dukhan canal, which feeds agricultural lands in the area.

Engineer Mahmoud al-Saadi told Al-Monitor that the authority went on full alert following the Kafr El Sheikh inundation and announced a state of emergency for all the nation’s coasts, mainly for the delta beaches that are more prone to erosion due to violent thunderstorms.

He said the authority has set up a central operations room in its headquarters, operating 24 hours to monitor any storm surge and to follow up on coastal protection work through communication with all its departments.

Saadi said this time of year is critical, as thunderstorms and strong tides cause sea level surges and flood coastal areas.

He said the authority is implementing several projects in three governorates, including Damietta, Alexandria and Kafr El Sheikh, to protect shores from erosion, at a total cost of 1.8 billion pounds ($100.8 million).

Mohamed Suleiman, former director of the Coastal Research Institute (CORI), told Al-Monitor the Nile Delta is the most threatened delta in the world, as it is so low-lying and is gradually sinking.

He said the coast of the Nile Delta is sinking at a rate of 1 to 3 millimeters (0.04 to 0.12 inches) per year, which does not seem alarming. But he said that the Mediterranean Sea level is also rising by 2 millimeters (0.08 inches) a year and that this is what makes things worse in the delta. He said sea level is expected to rise by 50 centimeters (20 inches) over the next 50 to 100 years, which will inundate many areas along the coast.

Suleiman said climate change is evident in the increase of weather events involving high winds and major storms, which used to occur every 20 years on average. He said that after such events occurred only a couple of years apart, in 2013 and 2015, ""The month of January 2018 saw two major storms, which threaten the Egyptian coasts.”

He said many risks resulting from sea level rise are economic, as much arable land will become salinized in the affected governorates. He said it is unlikely that residents in the coastal governorates will be displaced at this time because the sea has not risen to a threatening level of complete inundation.

Suleiman also said methods of protection vary from one case to another, noting that beach said nourishment is the most practiced method in Egypt, followed by submerged or high breakwaters depending on the area. He said the areas that are most threatened with sinking are ones adjacent to lakes, including ones in the delta, because of human encroachments on them.

He called upon the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources to preserve the wall of Mohammed Ali, located in the Abu Qir Bay, as it protects the southern part of the area as well as Lake Mariout. He said the wall was the first means of beach protection used in Egypt.

Of note, the Egyptian government accepted a $31.5 million grant from the Green Climate Fund on Oct. 2 to protect the areas that are most affected by climate change. This is the biggest grant Egypt has ever received for environmental projects.

The Water Research Center of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources held a meeting for the project’s Steering Committee on Dec. 17. The project was implemented in the five most affected governorates, Port Said, Damietta, Dakahlia, Kafr El Sheikh and Beheira.",2018-12-21 08:00:00+00:00,"['kafr', 'threaten', 'sea', 'egyptian', 'sheikh', 'water', 'level', 'rising', 'authority', 'coastal', 'coasts', 'el', 'protection', 'levels', 'delta']",Egypt,news article,English
1269,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Chitralis chalk out own disaster risk management plans - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1624066,"CHITRAL: The residents of the disaster-prone villages of Chitral have formulated their own disaster risk management plans to mitigate the destruction caused by natural calamities.

Wasif Ahmed, resilience manager of an international organisation based in Chitral, told Dawn that the region was highly vulnerable to natural hazards like hydrological, geo-climatic and glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs).

He said a number of natural disasters had struck Chitral during the last about 15 years, claiming scores of lives and sweeping away more than five villages. He said loss to the physical infrastructure was estimated at Rs16 billion.

Chitral is home to 543 glaciers spreading over 4,000 square kilometres, out of which, 116 have been declared sensitive and 10 hyper-sensitive. Most of these glaciers are said to be at the verge of explosion, triggering Glofs, he said.

The vulnerable communities have made them highly resilient to such disasters. If a village is hit by a disaster they manage it efficiently by mobilising their own resources and volunteers to carry out rescue operations.

Trained by Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH) the vulnerable villagers have formulated their own disaster risk management plans keeping in view the nature of the hazard and its anticipated magnitude, he explained.

As per the management plan, a stockpile of non-food items is maintained at the union council level to be moved to the affected area without waiting for the government response, Wasif Ahmed said.

He said the trained volunteers rushed to the community emergency response team (CERT) within a few minutes of the occurrence of the disaster and started search and rescue operations. Women had also been included in the scheme, he added.

He recalled that a group of volunteers had rushed to a village in Karimabad valley last year in no time, shifted the injured to safe places, provided them first aid and arranged food supplies for the displaced.

Mr Ahmed said the community-based risk management mechanism had helped people in the disaster-prone valleys of Chitral in an efficient way.

He said the residents of the flood-prone villages had recently put in place an early warning system and deputed a person in the highlands with a mobile phone who promptly informed them about any incoming flood.

In July last year, the residents of Golen valley rushed to the higher lands within 10 to 15 minutes of the explosion of a glacial lake after the person deputed at highlands informed them about it, he said.

1437,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Climate crisis blamed for rains and floods that have killed 150 in Brazil - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/13/climate-crisis-blamed-for-rains-and-floods-that-have-killed-150-in-brazil,"About 150 people have been killed or are missing following record-breaking heavy rains, landslides and flooding in three Brazilian states this year.

Scientists say global heating is contributing to more “extreme rainfall” events in the country, and warned that such disasters could become “the new normal”.

Monsoon rains kill Brazilians every summer, with floodwaters filling streets and landslides afflicting poorer communities and favelas built on steep hillsides, often without proper drainage or sanitation.

But global temperatures have climbed steeply since the 1980s, and a warming atmosphere causes more evaporation, making more water available for precipitation.

Official data sent to the Guardian showed “extreme rainfall events” – when more than 80mm or 100mm falls within 24 hours – have soared over the past 30 years in the capitals of the south-eastern states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, where the deadly rains happened.

Scientists blame a combination of growing cities and climate breakdown.

“We are seeing more and more extreme events happening in big and important cities,” said Tercio Ambrizzi, a professor of climatology at the University of São Paulo. “There is a relationship with the increase in average global temperatures.”

In Guarujá, a coastal town 25 miles from São Paulo, 282mm fell in just 12 hours last week – more than the total expected for the entire month of March.

“I never saw a day it rained like that,” said Rafael Soares, 22, a tyre factory worker from the town’s hillside Barreira do João Guarda community, hit by a landslide on 3 March that buried dozens of houses, killing 18 people and leaving dozens still missing.

Soares heard a deafening boom at about 1am and ran up the hill behind his house to find that part of his community had been buried.

“You couldn’t see anything, just earth and mud,” he said, describing “just hearing cries, people crying, not knowing what to do. There was no light, there was nothing.”

He spent days with neighbours and rescue workers digging survivors and the dead out of the earth and was housed with hundreds of other residents in a local school before being allowed to go home.

Days earlier, five people died during heavy rains across Rio de Janeiro. One man drowned when the Acari favela in north Rio was flooded. Bruna Aguiar, an activist from the favela’s Fala Akari collective, said rains have worsened there since a flood in 2013.

“Older people talk about other floods in the 1970s, but nothing of this magnitude,” she said.

According to data from Brazil’s National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), one Rio de Janeiro weather station logged 134 extreme rainfalls from 1960 to 1990, and 221 from 1990 to 2020. A São Paulo weather station reported 15 from 1960 to 1990 and 44 since.

“There’s clearly been an increase of extreme events in the south-east of Brazil,” Ambrizzi said.

His own research from São Paulo – capital of the state where four people died in two days in February following heavy rainfall – backs this up.

Data from two weather stations in the city showed an increase in extreme rain events, according to a paper Ambrizzi and other scientists published in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences last month. The dry season has begun extending from September into October in recent decades, they found.

“This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of water-courses, leads to inundation, flooding and landslides,” the paper said. “Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanisation.”

“Urban heat islands” created by the concrete and lack of vegetation in big cities increase temperatures, scientists said, and lack of permeable ground means more flooding. Global warming exacerbates the effect.

“When it is hotter, it rains more, and this gets worse if you have urban areas, areas of concrete and asphalt,” said José Marengo from Brazil’s National Centre for Monitoring and Alerts of Natural Disasters, and another of the paper’s authors.

Not all scientists hold global warming responsible. Brazil’s Space Research Institute said the rains were “meteorological phenomena typical of summer”, and blamed them on the South Atlantic convergence zone – “a band of clouds that channels moisture from the Amazon and the tropical Atlantic Ocean” for three days or more, producing heavy rain and cold fronts. Nor has the rain increased everywhere: the north-east has seen more extreme droughts, it said.

“You can’t generalise everything and blame global warming for everything,” said Josélia Pegorim, a meteorologist from the Climatempo weather service, while noting summer’s rains have been exceptional. “We are breaking records,” she said.

In January, 59 people were killed during heavy rains in Minas Gerais state. According to Inmet data, its capital Belo Horizonte saw 30 “extreme rain” events from 1960 to 1990, and 52 from 1990 to 2020.

In Belo Horizonte, 13 people were killed in January, when 935mm of rain was recorded at one weather station – the highest level since 1910, and more than half the rainfall expected for the whole year.Extreme rain events and consecutive droughts are likely to continue, said Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies. “This is the new normal,” he said.",2020-03-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['warming', 'extreme', 'paulo', 'killed', 'crisis', 'brazil', 'rain', 'weather', 'floods', 'climate', 'events', 'heavy', 'rains', 'global', '150', 'são', 'blamed']",Brazil,news article,English

In response to the attempted hacks, Bank Indonesia (BI) has blocked 149 regions that don’t usually access its website, including several small African countries, Deputy Governor Ronald Waas said in an interview late on Monday.

He said several central banks were hit by similar attacks and were sharing the IP addresses used by the perpetrators.

Central banks have been on high alert in the wake of revelations that hackers issued fraudulent money transfers to steal $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank in February.

No money was lost in the attacks on Bank Indonesia and the Bank of Korea, which were mainly DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attempts, the officials said.

There was no word on who the hackers were.

Waas said the cyber attacks were unsuccessful because of the cooperation between central banks.

“There is regional cooperation between central banks. Those who have gotten hit are sharing their experiences,” he said.

Anonymous, a loosely associated international network of activists and hackers, originated in 2003. It said in a YouTube video posted in early May that it would launch a 30-day campaign to attack central bank sites in what it dubbed as Operation Icarus.

DDoS is its preferred method of attack, disabling websites by flooding them with internet requests, overwhelming the servers temporarily. Sometimes the hackers succeed in gaining access to data, but rarely do they penetrate more critical systems in such attacks.

Bank of Korea officials told Reuters there was at least one DDoS attack on the bank’s website in May. No harm was done, they said.

“In May, we’ve had so many disturbances,” Benny Sadwiko, who is leading Bank Indonesia’s cyber security efforts, told Reuters.

“They are trying to attack the reputation of the banks. So we’re blocking IP addresses from countries that don’t usually access us.”

In just half a day on Monday, Bank Indonesia detected 273 viruses and 67,000 spam emails to its email server and website, officials said.

In early May, Greece’s central bank said that its website became the target of a cyber attack by Anonymous for a few minutes before the bank’s security systems managed to tackle it. The Central Bank of Cyprus has also said its website briefly came under attack in May.",2016-06-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['hit', 'banks', 'indonesia', 'losses', 'attacks', 'website', 'cyber', 'attack', 'websites', 'hackers', 'central', 'bank', 'korea', 'officials', 'south']",India,news article,English

At least 90 lives have been lost, over 1,000 homes have been destroyed and thousands more have been displaced.

The flood situation in Pakistan is a complete disaster. In the north-west heavy downpour has overwhelmed the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A total of 23 lives have been lost in this province alone. In the north-east, the province of Punjab is no better, eight lives have been lost to incessant rains and flooding.In the south-west Balochistan too is reeling with flood and at least 15 people have died.

Right next to Balochistan is Sindh. The worst affected province in Pakistan, where 31 people have died here due to the annual monsoon deluge.

Karachi is the capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's financial hub. Karachi is now a submerged city. The residents say they are losing everything to rainwater.

At least eight people have died in Karachi alone. Mostly due to electrocution and drowning. Now, sewage water is flooding homes in low-lying areas and disaster relief is yet to arrive.

Shama Parveen, impacted by flooding said: ""When the water reached neck high, we lifted our kids on shoulders and took refuge at the neighbour's house. We spent the whole night sitting at the roof, only we know how we had spent the night. My daughter-in-law's furniture is sinking at home, everything we had is sinking.""

789,FL-2016-000114-EGY,2019 Floodwater flowing into Egypt exceeds earlier years - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/75748/2019-Floodwater-flowing-into-Egypt-exceeds-earlier-years,"FILE: The River Nile in Aswan

CAIRO – 13 October 2019: The volume of floodwater flowing into Egypt in October exceeds those of earlier years, and the overall amount in 2019 is “promising,” the Ministry of Irrigation said Sunday.



By August, the floodwater was around the average, but the rain has increased significantly downstream since then, according to the ministry statement.



The permanent committee at the ministry tasked with regulating the river water reviewed the impact of the water year on Egypt’s water resources at this time and how the water should be distributed for different purposes.



It also discussed the measures needed to raise the efficiency of estuaries and canals, update maps, improve the water quality, clean the riverbed, and achieve the equilibrium of the river. Pollutants deposited in the Nile could be eliminated by increasing the river disposals to “wash” the riverbed, which may heighten the water level on the riverbanks and within the water surface that includes the main stream and the accretion of the river.



The statement said the ministry is strictly applying the regulations to counter encroachments to protect the borders of the Nile and its two distributaries, Damietta and Rosetta, and prevent any activities inside the restricted areas of the Nile.

1373,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,How Kenya Copes with Thousands of Displaced Climate Migrants - TIME,https://time.com/5953402/climate-migrants-kenya-floods/,"When he was a child, James Owuor loved hearing the elders talk about the way life used to be. So it comes as something of a surprise that at 38, he is now the one tasked with the job of describing the Before Times in Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley. Before Lake Baringo started to rise, before it flooded and stole everything he knew.

â??At the beginning, we just thought it was a bad rainy season, that the water would recede when the dry season came. It didnâ??t,â? he says ruefully, peering over the edge of his motorized canoe at what used to be houses below the milky brown waters. Over the past decade, an unprecedented increase in annual rainfallâ??widely attributed to climate changeâ??has raised the lake by 40 ft. (12 m), inundating nearly 22,000 acres and destroying homes, businesses and Roberts Camp, the lakeside resort where Owuor has worked for most of his adult life.

In 2014, he watched the waters overtake the two-story-tall shorefront lodge. The restaurant went next, then the bar. In September, the resortâ??s entrance gate on the road to the nearby town of Kampi Ya Samaki went under. Navigating through the drowned remnants of downtown, Owuor points out the remains of a fish factoryâ??s roof. A crocodile paddles past the submerged rooms of the Lake Breeze Restaurant and Bar while a hippo grunts from the nave of a flooded church. Water laps at the third-floor balconies of the luxury Soi Safari Lodge, an 80-room resort that once employed 300 locals.

Eventually, he says, â??people will have to leave this place and find somewhere else to live. If they were running a business, that means they probably will not have that business anymore. Life is drastically going to change.â?

An even bigger threat looms. The nearby alkaline Lake Bogoria is also rising. Twice as salty as seawater, and home to more than a million flamingos, Lake Bogoria is on the brink of breaching its own natural barriers. If the waters rise up by another 4 m, says Professor Simon M. Onywere, a geologist at Kenyatta Universityâ??s department of environmental planning, it could flood freshwater Lake Baringo with a deadly spill of alkaline waters. The two lakes used to be 12 miles (20 km) apart. Over the past decade, climate change has nearly halved the distance.

The merging of the two lakes would be devastating, says Paul Chepsoi, an environmentalist and advocate for local Indigenous rights from the area. â??Itâ??s not just a worst-case scenario. Itâ??s an ecological and human disaster.â? More than 100,000 people depend on Baringo for income, from either fishing or agriculture. A saltwater influx would destroy both industries. â??It means that livelihoods will be affected for generations to come,â? Chepsoi says, standing in the middle of a paved road that once led to the gates of Bogoriaâ??s national park. Water laps at his feet. A nearby lakeside lodge, like the park entrance sign behind him, is mostly underwater.

Nothing short of a catastrophic droughtâ??the kind that would also destroy livelihoodsâ??will stop the rising waters. â??The people here will have to leave,â? says Chepsoi. Many, he says, are already being forced to migrate to neighboring towns and cities largely unprepared for the influx. â??The pressure of so many new arrivals will overwhelm the services providers,â? he worries. â??They are not prepared with housing, water, health care facilities or police.â? Migration may be inevitable, but if the destination cannot absorb the new migrants, they may find themselves even worse off.

In some parts of the world, climate change brings drought. In Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley, it has brought torrential, out-of-season rains over the past decade, which, combined with deforestation, have resulted in rising waters in all of the valleyâ??s eight lakes. Some have nearly doubled in size, drowning pastureland, farms, homes, schools, churches, clinics and businesses in what Elizabeth Meyerhoff, an American social anthropologist who studies Rift Valley communities, calls a â??slow-motion tsunami.â? By the end of 2020, one of Kenyaâ??s wettest years on record, Baringo had risen by several meters, and had claimed 34 sq. mi. of land.

The local ward administrator says that a health clinic, a technical college, five schools, seven churches, 48 shops and 1,250 housesâ??home to nearly a third of the populationâ??have been destroyed. Thousands in the Rift Valley lakes region have been forced from their homes. They are part of a new, global movement of refugees fleeing not conflict but climate change.

You find another job or another field,â? says Meyerhoff. â??But once you lose everythingâ?? your home, your school, your clinic, your road, your churchâ??then itâ??s an impossible situation. You become an environmental migrant because you have to find those facilities in some other place.â? She is no detached observer; her own home for the past 40 years is just a few inches away from being swallowed by Baringoâ??s rising waters. In her notebook, she carries a photo of her teenage children leaping from her gardenâ??s cliffside edge into the lake 40 ft. (12 m) below. Now in their 30s, they could sit in the same spot and dabble their feet in the water. They are begging her to pack up and leave; if she does, she will need to get a boatâ??the road to her house is already underwater.

Some 24 million peopleâ??more than three times the number fleeing armed conflictâ??are displaced each year by ecological disasters such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and rising sea levels, according to an October 2020 analysis by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a global think tank headquartered in Sydney. In the next 30 years, some 1.2 billion more people could be displaced if greenhouse-gas emissions continue on an upward trajectory, accelerating global warming and amplifying climate impacts, particularly in rural areas where livelihoods are dependent on the kind of agriculture most affected by changing weather patterns.

For a long time, experts have seen this kind of migration as flowing from the failure of carbon-spewing nations to rein in their emissions, along with the inability of poorer governments to protect their citizens through adequate adaptation measures. But that view is changing: there comes a point where no amount of infrastructure can hold back the sea, bring back the seasonal rains or cool the global climate. At that point, â??migration becomes the adaptation strategy,â? says Vittoria Zanuso, executive director of the Mayors Migration Council (MMC), a global organization that works with cities to develop comprehensive urban-migration programs. For many of these climate migrants, cities and towns will be their final destination.

Wealthy countries are not exempt. A 2018 study, published in the University of Chicagoâ??s Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, predicts that climate change will push 1 in 12 Southern and Midwestern residents of the U.S. to move to less affected areas in the Northeast and Northwest over the next 45 years. â??Itâ??s no longer a question of if climate migration is happening but rather who, how much, where and when,â? says Alex Randall of the U.K.-based Climate and Migration Coalition. â??Up until now, the focus has been on stopping people from migrating in the first place. Now the focus needs to be on how to make them an asset rather than a burden for the places they are going.â?

Cities need migrants in order to grow, but chaotic, undirected migration can be as disruptive as an influx of salt into a freshwater lake. That means preparing towns for a new generation of climate migrants by building up infrastructure and increasing services from sanitation to education and health careâ??often a pricey undertaking for cash-strapped municipalities. New York Cityâ??s annual budget per resident is approximately $9,500; Nairobiâ??s is around $74.

Several citiesâ??including Orlando; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Freetown, Sierra Leoneâ??have launched programs to build climate resilience while making sure new arrivals have opportunities for both safe housing and fair employment. These programs are usually funded by the municipality, but in order for them to expand, more investment is needed. International climate funds should play more of a role, says Randall. â??Once you accept that moving is a form of adaptation, we would potentially get to a point where climate-adaptation finance could be spent on helping people move safely, or making sure cities had the necessary infrastructure for coping with rapid growth.â?

As part of the discussions that led to the Paris Agreement, wealthier nations committed to contribute $100 billion a year to help poorer countries combat climate change through loans, grants, cash and private investments. The Green Climate Fund, as it is known, is the worldâ??s largest fund dedicated to addressing climate change, but so far, only 20% of global contributions have gone toward adaptation, with the rest largely going to greenhouse-gas-reduction projectsâ??despite a stated goal of 50-50 allocation. (Donor nations make the final decision on project financing.)

To developing nations that typically bear a lesser responsibility for the climate crisis, itâ??s an egregious oversight. â??When it comes to a country like Bangladesh or Kenya, where our emissions are small to start with, telling us to use the money to reduce emissions doesnâ??t make sense,â? says Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD). â??We need the money for adaptation; that should be the priority.â? Zanuso, of the MMC, estimates that urban-adaptation projectsâ??enabling cities to absorb migrants in a way that helps them and their host communities flourishâ??receive only 3% to 5% of the adaptation funding that has been made available.

When the rising waters of Lake Nakuru, 85 miles (137 km) south of Lake Baringo, claimed the rural settlement of Mwariki in September, Evelyn Ajuang, a 41-year-old widow with close-cropped dark hair, had nowhere to go. She had just spent her entire life savings building and furnishing a four-bedroom house and had nothing to fall back on. So Ajuang took a single room in a low-income neighborhood in the middle of Nakuru town. She sold her goats and chickens to cover three monthsâ?? rentâ??besides, the concrete warren of crammed shacks offered no space for livestock. Now, unable to sell the eggs, milk and vegetables that once provided a steady income, she fears the uncertainty ahead.

Ajuang, like most of us, has only a vague understanding of how rising carbon emissions could trigger the rains that have flooded the Rift Valley lakes, but she knows enough to blame it for destroying her life. â??Climate change is why I donâ??t think I will ever return to my home,â? she says, eyeing the four roomsâ?? worth of furniture stacked to the ceiling of her rented room.

Ajuang has been thrust unprepared, and unsupported, into urban life. Every market day, she goes to the wholesale market across town to buy the vegetables she once grew in her own garden, which she sells for a slight profit in her new neighborhood. But transport is expensive, and competition is high. Most months, she canâ??t even make her $30 rent. So far, 153 families from Mwariki have lost their homes; another 174 farmers have lost their fields. Most are sheltering with family or charity organizations in town. While Kenyan authorities say they are looking into the matter, the former residents of Mwariki say the government has yet to distribute any substantial aid or even broach a resettlement plan, leaving victims in agonizing limbo. At least one has committed suicide, says community organizer David Kahoro; several have suffered heart attacks, and many are facing destitution. But it doesnâ??t have to be this way.

Sub-Saharan Africa is already one of the fastest urbanizing regions, with around 450 million city dwellers. That number is expected to climb to 621 million by 2030, the equivalent of adding two New York Citys to the continent each year. Climate change has been a major driver of this urbanization and is likely to increase the pressure on city infrastructure and resources, says sociologist Marc Helbling of Germanyâ??s University of Mannheim. Helbling has tracked 50 yearsâ?? worth of urbanization trends in 133 countries and found that rising temperatures consistently lead to higher levels of rural-to-urban migration.

Done right, urbanization can foster economic growth. No modern country has ever reached middle-income status without urbanizing first. But uncontrolled, it can result in slums, mismanaged sprawl, poor public health and rising insecurity for residentsâ??a city that is less inclusive, less productive and less sustainable. An influx of climate migrants could drive the development of several African megacities (population 10 million or more) into global powerhouses within the next decade and a halfâ??but it could also create unprecedented mega-slums.

â??If cities donâ??t start planning now for climate migrants, this will certainly increase all the problems that come with uncontrolled urbanizationâ??overpopulation, increased pollution, sanitation challengesâ??and it means that they wonâ??t be able to pre-empt the negative or indirect impact of those migrants,â? says Linda Adhiambo Oucho, executive director of the Nairobi-based African Migration and Development Policy Centre.

That means doing something that few governments are good at: preparing for a crisis that hasnâ??t yet happened. Urban planning is a slow science, says Oucho. â??We donâ??t want to get to a situation where we are talking about what to do about mass displacement when climate refugees are already streaming into the city; we need to start addressing it now while it is still manageable.â? In part, that means expanding schools, health clinics, sewage systems and transport networks, but it also means making sure that the new arrivals move into safe areas where they wonâ??t be exposed to additional climate hazards, like the flooding and storm surges that already threaten the low-income neighborhoods usually found in low-lying areas.

Most important is making sure that rural migrants are able to transition to urban livelihoods. â??We donâ??t want to see cattle herders begging on street corners because they donâ??t have the skills to thrive in the city,â? says Oucho. â??The only way climate migrants can become a positive factor in urban growth is if they have the retraining and skills transfer that will allow them to adapt and survive and find new opportunities.â?

While Kenya is only just starting to see the impacts of climate migration, some countries have had years of experience and can offer a template for urban-adaptation solutions. Bangladesh, with its population of 163 million relatively poor residents residing on a flood-prone delta threatened by rising sea levels, was once the global symbol for climate-change victims. But over the past decade, the nation has embarked on a multipronged adaptation strategy that is now starting to show results. â??We are still very vulnerable,â? says Huq of the ICCCAD, â??but that vulnerability isnâ??t the story anymore. Itâ??s how we deal with the vulnerability.â?

The key, says Huq, is long-term thinking. Even as the adult population is taught to adapt by switching to salt-tolerant rice, or to farm shrimp instead of vegetables, younger generations are offered an education that will allow them to eventually flourish in an urban setting. â??The second order of adaptation is preparing people to move by their own volition, not being forced to move [by climatic conditions] but being enabled to move and resettle in towns with greater protection.â?

Huqâ??s center, which focuses on climate change and adaptation in developing countries, also works to divert migration streams away from the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, toward secondary cities better prepared to absorb the flows. The center identified some 20 target towns on the basis of their ability both to withstand climatic changes and to offer employment and education opportunities for newcomers. The most overlooked part, he says, is what he calls the â??softwareâ? that accompanies the â??hardwareâ? of infrastructure development: working with civil-society organizations to â??help residents understand that there will be climate migrants coming in and that they need to be welcomed and supported so they can settle in and become citizens of that town.â? Otherwise, he says, conflict between groups could derail progress.

To a certain extent, every place will have to keep its own unique geography in mind. The state of New Jersey, for example, has worked with Rutgers University to map out the areas most likely to flood as sea levels rise in the coming years in order to forestall risky development projects. That kind of thinking should be more widespread, says Randall, particularly when it comes to the poorer urban areas where climate migrants are most likely to settle. â??What we are seeing at the moment is people leaving a rural area affected by drought, for example, and moving to a city where theyâ??ve managed to find work but are living in an informal settlement that is vulnerable to flooding. They may have moved, but they have traded one kind of climate risk for another.â?

And in some cases, a proactive climate-adaptation policy may mean helping whole communities start all over again. In Louisiana, government officials are spending $48.3 million to relocate several dozen households from the low-lying Isle de Jean Charles to higher ground 40 miles away, as part of the first federally funded, climate-change-induced community resettlement project in the U.S. Construction on the new houses started in May 2020.

Wholesale community relocation is expensive and best used as an option of last resort, but Ajuang, who lost her home to the rising waters of Lake Nakuru, canâ??t help wondering how different her life would have been if the government was able to offer her another property. She doesnâ??t think victims of the floods should get money, but having a safe place to land and the resources to start over would have helped. She worked for years to buy her own house to be self-sufficient in retirement and is desperate to regain that autonomy.

Wading hip-deep past what used to be her front porch one recent afternoon, she shoos away a pelican stalking fish in her old goat pen. Referring to the hustle that helped her get her own home, she says she would happily do it all over again, given an opportunity. She just needs a dry piece of land to start. â??Without somewhere to go, the dreams I had for my future and my life will end just like that.â?

The Kano State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) has confirmed four persons killed and over 5,200 houses destroyed due to flooding in Rogo and Danbatta Local Government Areas of the state.

Sale Jili, Executive Secretary of the Agency, confirmed the incident in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Kano.

NAN reports that the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has predicted flooding occasioned by heavy rainfall in 20 Local Government Areas of the state.

Mr Jili disclosed that two persons lost their lives and 200 houses destroyed in Rogo, while two other persons and over 5,000 houses were destroyed by flood in Danbatta.

We deployed assessment teams to the affected areas. We also visited Rogo and Danbatta to sympathise with the victims over the disaster.

There are reports of flooding in the 44 LGAs of the state due to heavy rainfall this season, he said.

According to him, the displaced persons are currently taking shelter with their relatives in the affected communities.

1168,FL-2020-000207-NGA,How Africa's largest city is staying afloat - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210121-lagos-nigeria-how-africas-largest-city-is-staying-afloat,"Navigating the thronging streets of Lagos, Nigeria, is a challenge at the best of times. But during the rainy seasons, the city's streets can become almost impassable. Home to more than 24 million, Lagos is Nigeria's economic powerhouse, making it a destination for people seeking new opportunities. But that rapid growth creates pressure on the streets, and the environment.

The streets are often flooded, in part due to the dysfunctional disposal of the 6,000-10,000 tonnes of rubbish generated daily in the city. After a downpour, rubbish piles up in open gutters and makes moving around the streets difficult. I worry when it rains, especially when it is heavy, says Lagos resident Stephanie Erigha. ""It makes me anxious."" On one occasion when taking a taxi through a waterlogging-prone part of the city, she recalls the water gushing right into the back seat next to her.

While the overall climate in Lagos is expected to see less rainfall overall with climate change, the intensity of rain is expected to increase, bringing with it greater risk of flooding. Meanwhile, the low-lying city is also particularly vulnerable to water from another source: rising seas. If global warming exceeds 2C, the city is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100, according to research led by marine physicist Svetlana Jevrejeva, of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.

How, in the face of flooding, blocked streets and rising waters, is Africa's most populous city adapting?

Floating architecture

There is one part of Lagos that has extensive experience of dealing with high water. Much of the Makoko neighbourhood is not built on land, but rather sits on stilts above the waterline. Makoko, known as the ""Venice of Africa"", is a labyrinthine slum built on stilts and navigated by canoe. The slum has little access to electricity or clean sanitation, but it has also been home to innovations like the Makoko Floating School, a structure resting on recycled empty plastic barrels for buoyancy. The school's pyramid shape helped lower its centre of gravity and so increase its stability, while also being an ideal roof shape for shedding heavy rains.",2021-01-22 08:00:00+00:00,"['afloat', 'water', 'rubbish', 'streets', 'slum', 'africas', 'staying', 'rising', 'lagos', 'stilts', 'shape', 'largest', 'city', 'makoko']",Nigeria,news article,English

Sajith Kumar refers to the arrest of 26/11 mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed by Pakistan authorities. The cartoonist highlights the hand-in-glove nature of politics in Pakistan over terrorism.

Alok Nirantar illustrates the irony behind Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s recent protests against non-payment of farmers’ insurance by the Maharashtra government even as his party remains in alliance with the ruling BJP.

Satwik Gade illustrates the devastating floods in Assam which has submerged over 90 per cent of Kaziranga National Park and killed 15 animals, including a one-horned rhinoceros. More animals are fleeing to higher elevations for safety.

Nala Ponnappa takes a jibe at the political situation in Karnataka, where MLAs seem to hopping from one party to another. Last week, 15 rebel MLAs camped out in a Mumbai hotel after tendering in their resignations.

Manjul takes a jibe at Pakistan after it received a ‘spanking’ at the International Court of Justice in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. The court put a stay on Jadhav’s death sentence by Pakistan’s military court, although it rejected India’s plea for his acquittal.

Dozens die each year while working in the country's highly lucrative but poorly regulated jade industry, which uses low-paid migrant workers to scrape out a gem highly coveted in China.

The landslide struck early on Thursday close to the Chinese border in Kachin state after a bout of heavy rainfall, the Myanmar Fire Services Department said on Facebook.

""A total of 113 bodies been found so far,"" Myanmar Fire Service said in a Facebook post.

A local police officer said search and rescue efforts had been suspended due to heavy rains.

""The jade miners were smothered by a wave of mud,"" an earlier statement from the Fire Service said.

The workers were scavenging for the precious gemstones on the sharp mountainous terrain in Hpakant township, where furrows from earlier digs had already loosened the earth.

Photos posted on the Facebook page showed a search and rescue team wading through a valley apparently flooded by the mudslide.

Open jade mines have pockmarked Hpakant's remote terrain and given it the appearance of a vast moonscape.

Fatal landslides in the area are common, and the victims are often from impoverished ethnic communities that are looking for scraps left behind by big firms.

Watchdog Global Witness estimated that the industry was worth some $31 billion in 2014, although very little reaches state coffers.

Northern Myanmar's abundant natural resources — including jade, timber, gold and amber — help finance both sides of a decades-long civil war between ethnic Kachin insurgents and the military.

“Given the scale and scope of the food insecurity in Zimbabwe”, Mr. Verhoosel said “WFP is planning to scale up to assist over two million people” by the peak of the lean season during early next year.

Until then, teams will continue providing food assistance to the most vulnerable populations, while also helping communities to build resilience to climate change and future shock impacts.

Over the next nine months, he said that WFP urgently requires $173 million to meet these needs.

The Committee is a consortium of government, UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and other international organizations, and the Rural Livelihood Assessment provides key information for government and development partners on rural livelihood programming in southern African nation. WFP plays a key role in contributing financially and technically to the assessment.

Cyclones, drought push Mozambicans deep into food insecurity

And apart from the deadly cyclones that hit both Mozambique and Zimbabwe earlier in the year, Mozambique’s population has also suffered a rise in food insecurity, fueled by other extreme weather events, Mr. Verhoosel said.

In January, tropical storm Desmond flooded the central provinces of Sofala, Tete and Zambézia. And in March, Cyclone Idai destroyed unharvested crops.

Six weeks later, Cyclone Kenneth slammed the province of Cabo Delgado in the north. Since that time the area has been suffering through irregular rainfall patterns and cereal crops have been hit by pest infestations.

Assistance aims to reach 1.2 million people – 900,000 of whom live in areas affected by Idai, 100,000 in areas affected by Kenneth and 250,000 people in areas affected by the drought.

Mr. Verhoosel referenced a WFP report pointing out that “1.6 million people already face acute food crisis” in 63 districts. The most recent revision of the Integrated Classification of Food Security Phase, highlights the ""difficult situation"" the country of more than 29 million inhabitants faces, until its next harvest.

While WFP had initially planned from July to October to help some 560,000 people each month in areas affected by cyclones and droughts, the rising need has sparked the agency to scale that number to 1.25 million beneficiaries per month.

Based on current needs, including the response to drought and Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, WFP requires $102 million over the next six months to implement its recovery plan.

To provide adequate and timely assistance, “resources must now be mobilized"" in response to increased needs”, warned Mr. Verhoosel.",2019-07-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['droughts', 'agency', 'mr', 'affected', 'insecure', 'verhoosel', 'zimbabwe', 'food', 'assistance', 'wfp', 'rural', 'million', 'scale', 'millions', 'areas', 'scales', 'leave']",Mozambique,news article,English
683,Drought Sri Lanka,Report: UN Proposes a Common Definition for Water Security on World Water Day 2013 - Circle of Blue WaterNews,https://www.circleofblue.org/2013/world/un-agency-proposes-a-common-definition-for-water-security/,"Water security should have a common language, and it should be a priority for global sustainable development goals, according to a new report by UN-Water.

By Brett Walton

Circle of Blue

In a report released today to mark World Water Day and 2013 as the International Year of Water Cooperation, UN-Water is proposing a common definition of water security. UN-Water, which coordinates water programs within the United Nations system, claims that a single description of the problem will help global collaboration around water, one of the world’s most vital needs.

Image courtesy of UN-Water ‘Water Security and the Global Agenda’ is the title of an analytical brief published by the United Nations for World Water Day 2013. Click image to enlarge.

The authors define water security as: “The capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development; for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters; and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability.”

At least 17 organizations affiliated with UN-Water contributed to the paper. Most contributors are United Nations agencies, but others include the International Association for Water Law, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Stockholm International Water Institute, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

“Common understanding has central importance in international discussions, and water security can’t continue to have a variety of meanings,” said Zafar Adeel in a statement. Adeel, who contributed to the report, is the co-chair of the UN-Water Task Force on Water Security and director of the Ontario-based Institute for Water, Environment, and Health.

“A shared and working definition is needed to get everyone on the same page,” Adeel said. “Only then can we collectively start to write a coherent response to the challenges.”

Words Into Action

In recent years, water has attracted some prominent advocates who want the world’s leaders to take notice. Last September, the InterAction Council, a public-policy group of 40 former heads of state and government, encouraged the UN Security Council to address water scarcity.

The report was followed later that month by a roundtable discussion of water security during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. The General Assembly declared water and sanitation a human right after a vote in 2010.

A few months earlier, former U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton ordered the first cabinet-level assessment of global water security.

“Every definition results in more debate on the definition instead of focusing on the problem, which is access to water.” –John Hartley, CEO

Future Directions International

“You can’t work on water as a health concern independently from water as an agricultural concern,” Clinton said a year ago, during a World Water Day event in Washington, D.C. “And water that is needed for agriculture may also be water that is needed for energy production. So we need to be looking for interventions that work on multiple levels simultaneously and help us focus on systemic responses.”

Some water advocates are hoping that the water security definition newly proposed by UN-Water leads to action, rather than introspection.

“Every definition results in more debate on the definition instead of focusing on the problem, which is access to water,” said John Hartley, CEO of Future Directions International, a nonprofit institute in Western Australia that does research on food and water. Hartley told Circle of Blue that the definition is important and nearly all encompassing, but that food security needs to be considered alongside water.

Patricia Wouters agreed that results matter more than the particular definition, especially if that definition is in a policy document, rather than a legal agreement. Wouters, who reviewed a draft copy of the report, is a professor of international law at the UNESCO Center for Water Law, Policy, and Science at the University of Dundee, Scotland.

“I’m not bothered by the breadth or the multitude of issues. I’m happy that the UN is grappling with this.” –Patricia Wouters, international law professor

UNESCO Center for Water Law, Policy, & Science

“I’m not bothered by the breadth or the multitude of issues,” Wouters told Circle of Blue. “I’m happy that the UN is grappling with this.”

Precision will come into play in the next few years. Food and water, as well as sanitation, are drawing attention as the United Nations prepares to write a new agenda for social and economic well-being. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which came into effect at the turn of the century, expire in 2015. The United Nations announced last year that the MDG for water was attained, but the sanitation target will not be met.

Today’s UN-Water report calls for the still-evolving sustainable development goals to include a numerical target for water security. The report argues that water security — because of the broad definition — is something of an umbrella goal. In other words, if water is adequately addressed, success will cover other areas such as health, nutrition, environmental protection, and employment.

“It is safe to state that investment in water security is a long-term pay-off for human development and economic growth, with immediate visible short-term gains,” the report states.",2013-03-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['common', 'international', 'world', 'unwater', 'report', 'nations', 'water', 'security', 'day', 'proposes', 'united', 'definition', 'development', 'law']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

At a Glance A locust swarm of biblical proportions is expected to invade Kenya via Ethiopia, for the second time this year.

Governments and the U.N. have warned that the locust will cause major food shortage in the region.

The East African Community secretariat will set aside emergency funds to turn tides against floods and locusts.

As deadly flooding leaves thousands homeless in Kenya, and a second wave of locust threatens the countryâ??s food supply, the east African nation is having its economy tested along with its neighbors in the region.

Earlier this week, deadly flooding and landslides in the eastern part of the country killed at least 100 and left over 1,800 homeless. This comes just weeks after flooding in the western part of the country left scores more homeless, too.

Now, a locust swarm of biblical proportions is expected to invade Kenya via Ethiopia for the second time this year.

The first swarm was the largest swarm that east Africa had seen in over 30 years, and the worst Kenya had seen in 70 years. The swarms can move up to 100 miles a day, depending on the wind, and can eat their weight daily. The first generation swarm peaked in the region two months ago, with locusts numbering in the hundreds of millions.

This second generation swarm is even bigger and more threatening.

This is known as the second generation of the pests, meaning the first swarm reproduced. This second generation is younger and more aggressive than the first. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), left unchecked, locusts swarms multiply by a factor of 20 per generation. Practically, that means there are probably trillions of locusts in the current swarm. They also estimate that this swarm is 400 times stronger than the first.

Governments and the U.N. have warned that the locust will cause major food shortage in the region. In its latest locust watch update, the U.N. said the situation was â??extremely alarmingâ? as an increasing number of new swarms form in north and central Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia.

There are currently 18 swarms in Kenya. Regional governments have asked for financial aid to fight the swarms, but it is low priority due to COVID-19.

The swarms are near impossible to manage, especially without proper gear. As Ambroke Ngetich, FAO Project Officer in Kenya, told the BBC: â??Every time you are trying to control in one region, there is another swarm that is happening in a diff region and it is not possible to control them simultaneously.â?

Tens of thousands of liters of pesticides havenâ??t been able to reach the region, as the novel coronavirus closed international borders and disrupted the supply chain. Masses of adequate protective gear, to be used while spraying the pesticides, have also not made it to the region.

Advertisement Even if the materials were able to be delivered, however, it could be too late. Current solutions have not and will not work, the FAO warns local countries, as the sizes of the swarms are too big for aerial spraying. Further, current spraying practices donâ??t kill everything, leaving bugs in the ground.

The locusts present â??an extremely alarming and unprecedented threatâ? to food security and livelihoods, according to the U.N.

David Hughes from the U.N.â??s FAO, told the BBC that the swarms â??threaten the food of 23 million people. It is the number one food security issue in East Africa at the moment.â?

And, he explains, â??when you add on top of it, cyclones or whatever else weâ??ll have in the next 2-3 months... it's an absolutely unmitigated disaster.â?

The FAO warns that it will be too late to stop the locusts from spreading in less than six months, which would threaten millions with starvation.

Thus far, the winds have kept the swarm in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, which contains lots of open land unused by farmers. But with tens of millions in the region already dependent on food aid, this could turn into a humanitarian crisis quickly.

â??The current situation in East Africa remains extremely alarming as more swarms form and mature in northern and central Kenya and southern Ethiopia. This represents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods because it coincides with the early beginning of the long rains and the current growing season,â? warns desert locust situation update report by FAO.

The swarm threatens the entire East Africa region, not just Kenya. In February, eight east African countries experienced the worst outbreak in 70 years, exacerbated by climate change and war in Yemen. Yemen and east Africa are roughly 152 miles apart, separated just by the Gulf of Aden. Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda were worst hit by the swarms.

All of this happens as the Lake Victoria Basin countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania have experienced abnormally heavy rainfall since October 2019, which has effectively caused flooding, which also threatens food supply.

The East African Community (EAC) secretariat will set aside emergency funds to turn tides against floods and locusts, a new report by ReliefWeb indicates.

â??We have convened a meeting of Agriculture Ministers from the EAC to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture and the impending invasion of locusts in our region,â? said Christoph Bazivamo, deputy EAC secretary general in charge of the productive and social sector.",2020-05-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['africas', 'locust', 'swarm', 'food', 'threaten', 'floods', 'second', 'region', 'locusts', 'supply', 'swarms', 'east', 'kenya', 'severe', 'wave', 'generation']",Kenya,news article,English

The western Sohag-Qena road, Sheikh-Fadl-Ras Ghareb road, Qift-Quseir road, Safaga-Sohag road, Luxor-Nag Hammadi road, Luxor-Wadi Gedid road, Ghareb-Minya were closed. Safaga-Sohag road, Luxor-Nag Hammadi road and Qift-Quseir road were reopened later after the weather improved, as the weather forecast had predicted sandy winds.

In western Luxor, rain falling down from Ruzaiqat mountain caused floods on Saturday night. The city council dispatched equipment to change the course of the torrent into flood drainage systems so it does not reach homes in this mountanious area.

No injuries have been reported, but the city council raised its level of preparedness at the level of civil protection, ambulances and hospitals, and water and electriciy companies.

The rain comes after a heatwave across the country. The yearly floods usually affects the southern coast of the Red Sea, rather than Upper Egypt deep to the west of the shore. In recent years, Egypt has heavily invested in buildings dams and reservoirs at the Red Sea to both protect highways damaged every year due to floods and to perserve the freshwater.

Meanwhile, Egypt said the High Dam in Aswan is able to protect the country from floods coming from the Nile River, after several areas were severely damaged in the souther neighbor, Sudan, after heavy rains.",2020-09-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['luxor', 'flood', 'upper', 'floods', 'sea', 'egypt', 'red', 'western', 'weather', 'rains', 'road', 'rain', 'highways', 'swamps', 'video', 'safagasohag', 'mountain']",Egypt,news article,English
793,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Venetian anger after historic flood devastates city - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/venetian-anger-after-historic-flood-devastates-city/,"Venetians woke Wednesday to devastating scenes after the highest tide in 50 years washed through the historic Italian city, beaching gondolas, trashing hotels and sending tourists fleeing through rapidly rising waters.

Shopkeepers on the Grand Canal raged against those who have failed to protect the UNESCO city from the high tide, blaming corruption for the much-delayed barrier protection system which could have prevented the disaster.

“The city is on its knees,” Venice’s mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in an interview with national broadcaster RAI.

“There’s widespread devastation,” he said in the famed St. Mark’s Square, which bore the brunt of the flooding.

Tourists lugging heavy suitcases waded in thigh-high galoshes or barefoot through the submerged alleys, as water taxi and gondola drivers baled sewage-tainted water out of their trashed vessels.

The exceptionally intense “acqua alta,” or high waters, peaked at 1.87 meters (six feet). Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher, reaching 1.94 meters in 1966.

“It was unbelievable, the water rose so quickly,” said resident Tiziano Collarin, 59, as he surveyed the damage.

“Windows were blown out, there are those who have lost everything,” he said as the flood alarm rang out to warn those in the canal city that the tide, which had receded somewhat overnight, was coming in once again.

The fire brigade said it had carried out over 250 operations as well as laying on extra boats as water ambulances.

Around 150 fire fighters were deployed to rescue people stranded on jetties and to recover boats broken free from their moorings.

A 78-year old was killed by electric shock as the waters poured into his home, Italian media reported.

President of the Veneto region Luca Zaia said 80 percent of the city had been submerged, causing “unimaginable damage”.

– ‘Horrifying’ –

German tourist Gabi Brueckner, 58, said the nighttime drama had been “horrifying”.

She echoed the mayor in blaming climate change and said she feared like many people that “it will get worse and at some point Venice will drown”.

A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been underway since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays.

The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice’s lagoon during high tides — but a recent attempt to test part of the barrier caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered parts had rusted.

“They’ve done nothing, neglected it. It doesn’t work and they have stolen six billion euros. The politicians should all be put in jail,” said local Dino Perzolla, 62.

St. Mark’s Square in one of the lowest parts of the city was particularly affected, its vestibule inundated with water.

“It was apocalyptic, enough to give you goosebumps,” said Marina Vector, as she and her husband used buckets to scoop water out of their shop selling Venetian festival masks.

“The storm was so bad it broke the marble flood barrier out front. Nothing’s survived,” she said.

Tables and chairs set out for aperitifs bobbed outside bedraggled luxury hotels, where people of all ages seeking safety from the storm late Tuesday had been forced to climb in through windows after gangways washed away.

“I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. There was a terrifying wind, it was a hurricane. It was horrible,” said local Cristina, as she fought back tears.

In my role as an ambassador of the mission of Canada to ASEAN, I recently had the opportunity to participate in the ASEAN-Canada Joint Cooperation Committee – or short JCC. The JCC is one of a series of platforms for senior officials from ASEAN and Canada to come together every year to discuss our joint priorities.

This year's JCC – like many other meetings – was conducted virtually for the first time. While many of us have gotten used to a flood of virtual meetings and calls – both in our professional and private lives – this occasion made me reflect on how not being able to meet in a physical space may help us to understand the importance of togetherness – of coming together and working together, of collaborating and cooperating.

In fact, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its severe impact on health and economies, cooperation and collaboration among countries are needed now more than ever. As we face the greatest challenge of a generation, we need a collective and cooperative global response.

Canada and ASEAN have worked together for more than 44 years across various areas, including economic cooperation, disaster response, gender equality, security and human rights. Our four-decade spanning partnership is built on the spirit of cooperation and collaboration and can show the world what a close knit relationship like ours can accomplish. The recent JCC presented an excellent opportunity to strengthen our ties and discuss ways to come together to support a joint road to recovery and prosperity.

The past year has been a year of unprecedented challenges, and we are still in the middle of a global pandemic, grappling with its effects. However, it is inspiring to witness occasions where we rise to the challenge and find ways to turn them into opportunities.

Since our last JCC in 2020, ASEAN and Canada have come together to advance a possible ASEAN-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which will strengthen our economic ties and help us build back faster and better.

Given the external circumstances, this was no small feat, and we are thankful for the continued spirit of cooperation from our partners in ASEAN.

We are encouraged to see that Brunei, as chair of ASEAN in 2021, has included the launch of free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with Canada as a COVID-19 economic recovery priority. As trade-dependent economies,

Canada and ASEAN have a shared interest in fostering an open, international rules-based trading system that facilitates recovery efforts and benefits everyone. We are now working together with ASEAN to make Brunei's vision a reality and to securing the launch of FTA negotiations later this year.

It is also heartening to see that Canadian companies are increasingly engaged in the ASEAN region, from infrastructure to information and communication technology, to e-commerce, aerospace and defense, oil and gas, sustainable technologies, agriculture and agrifood, education, and beyond. This increasing cooperation translates into real opportunities for our people. We are convinced that with the ASEAN-Canada FTA, we will chart a successful, collective path forward.

However, while strengthening economic cooperation will help us emerge from this crisis stronger and better prepared for the future, it is essential not to lose sight of other critical common goals that the pandemic has impacted. One of them, which is particularly important for Canada, that underpins our policies at home and our international engagements, is the advancement of gender equality.

While more data is needed to understand the full implications that COVID-19 will have on gender balance, it is becoming clear that women make up most of the jobs that have been hardest hit by the pandemic and are far more likely than men to lose work. Also, they are picking up more of the unpaid care work related to stay-at-home orders, the closure of schools and childcare facilities, and an increased need for eldercare.

Empowering women and girls and promoting and protecting their human rights means ensuring the rights of half of the world's population. According to the UN World Food Programme, when women work, they invest 90 per cent of their income back into their families and communities, compared with 30 to 40 percent for men. Ensuring that women have the same opportunities by law and in practice is not only the right thing to do; it also makes economic sense. With much of our recent global progress towards gender equality at stake, Canada is committed to emphasizing that building back better means building a more gender-balanced world.

On the occasion of International Women's Day on March 3, the Mission of Canada to ASEAN hosted a speed mentoring event bringing together prominent women leaders to share their experiences and determination with other young women. During this event, one of the mentors, Col. Sus Ratih Pusparini, a staff member of the Foreign Cooperation Office of the Indonesian National Defense Institute, said she used to feel like she had to work harder in the military than her male counterparts. However, a superior encouraged her to keep having dreams, she then strived to work harder and kept an open mind and was after her perseverance assigned to the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.

Hearing these smart women talk about their experiences we are reminded of how far we have come and what positive impact gender balance can have on our societies and our economies.

Over the past month, I was able to be part of the first virtual ASEAN-Canada JCC and a virtual speed mentoring event. These events have shown me that our cooperation matters – be it economic cooperation, peace and security, gender equality and human rights or people-to-people connectivity. And if we are determined, we can overcome physical distance and work hand-in-hand to build a more equal and connected world. Collaboration is needed now more than ever! Let's keep working and, hopefully, next year, we will be able to share our perspectives face-to-face again at the next JCC.

689,Drought Sri Lanka,Why elephants need circuses and zoos - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-xpm-2012-nov-29-la-ol-elephants-circuses-blowback-20121129-story.html,"The Times’ editorial Monday on the L.A. City Council’s proposed ban on elephants performing in traveling shows such as circuses paints a romantic picture of elephants as gentle giants. The editorial board seems to buy into the animal extremists’ idealistic scenario of happy, fat pachyderms lazily wandering the open plains of Africa or the jungles of Asia, free of disease and conflict with humans.

The reality is far grimmer. The “wild” left for these magnificent animals is rapidly disappearing. Instead, these endangered and threatened animals are often contained within park ranges by fences, or, when no fences exist, villages and fields block historic migration routes, often leading to human-elephant conflict. In Sri Lanka, an island country with the highest elephant-to-human ratio, elephants regularly raid farmers’ fields, and human-elephant conflict sometimes leads to deaths -- of both elephants and humans.

In Africa, elephants may walk for miles during the drought months to find water and food -- a harsh reality that elephants in captivity don’t have to endure. Captive elephants don’t face the threat of being killed by humans from gunshot, electrocution or poisoning as they compete for resources or because their ivory is a valuable commodity. While park rangers do what they can to protect elephants from poachers, too many are being slaughtered. Calves are orphaned and often die without human intervention.

The imaginary Eden created by animal extremists has elephants and humans coexisting without interacting and ignores the reality of thousands of years of history. In fact, Asian elephants have been working in their native lands with their native peoples for thousands of years, just as horses have in lands where horses and people are found together. The Times has not called for an end to bridles on horses, but instead has demonized the traditional tool for working with elephants.

Commands are taught first and foremost to permit personal interaction between humans and elephants, which in turn allows for the provision of better husbandry and veterinary care. These movements are not taught through force or coercion, just as you would not beat your dog at home to make him sit. Elephants at zoos and circuses are taught primarily through a series of repetition and reward. Click here for a good discussion on training elephants as well as a better explanation of the Assn. of Zoos and Aquariums’ policy referenced in the editorial.

It is a good thing that people can see elephants at the L.A. Zoo or up close through traveling circuses. The elephants act as ambassadors for their species living in their range countries. While it may seem pleasant for extremists to imagine a perfect scenario in which elephants are set free to roam the hills of California to their hearts’ content, that isn’t the world in which we live. Elephants need people to care for them in captivity and to protect and conserve them in their range lands.

The Surulere neighborhood in Lagos was left filled with trash piles along waterways after heavy rainfall flooded the area on Sunday.

Photos showed massive amounts of waste that reportedly washed into the area from drainage channels and canals.

The Lagos State Government said Sunday night that officials are mandated to arrest anyone caught dumping trash in drainage channels and canals, according to the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR).

For years, residents in the region of 16 million people have complained about garbage piled along highways and drainage canals.

""The situation is getting out of hand, passing the refuse dumps is an eyesore,"" resident Halimat Mogaji told The Guardian in December. ""Most times I try to avoid walking past the dumps because of the amount of refuse by the roadside.""

Residents told the news outlet that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), which is responsible for collecting trash, often won't pick up waste from households that are behind on bills.

The situation led to poor sanitary conditions in the area, as canals fill with trash and standing water, the ICIR has reported.

1225,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan: Post-disaster recovery transition lessons from the 2010 floods - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/77313,"Source(s): Climate Adaptation Platform (CAP)



In 2010 severe flooding hit Pakistan, inundating about 37 thousand square kilometres of the nations area.

Over 20 million people were affected; the number is higher than those affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2005 Cyclone Katrina, or the 2008 cyclone Nargis in Myanmar.

The total loss from these massive floods totalled US$10.4 billion, or 5.7% of Pakistans GDP. After the flooding event, the rescue and relief activities lasted up to 8 months, which began in July 2010 until the end of March 2011.

Sindh province was one of the most affected by this event; out of the 20 million affected, 7.3 million residents were from the Sindh province. Sadly for them, the post-recovery after this unprecedented flood stopped at the rescue and relief phase.

According to the study, there was no recovery and reconstruction authority established in the province after the flooding incident  a task that belongs to Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Although the institution was lauded for its well-coordinated emergency phase efforts, the recovery and reconstruction phase efforts were missing in the province.

Using Pakistans worst flooding in 2010 as a case study, researchers examined the disaster recovery activities after the flood. They highlighted the factors that hinder the transitions to recovery phases in Pakistan, which may also be true in other developing countries.

The three Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) phases in the study are the following 

relief phase, which is meeting the most immediate needs of the community following a disaster, rehabilitation phase or the restoration of basic service and facilities to make communities and societies function; this includes providing temporary housing or shelter, mass feeding, treatment of the injured etc. and lastly, the recovery phase is also termed as the long-term phase wherein major reconstruction, development, and capacity building through structural or non-structural measures occur.

Other PDR phase model like the one proposed by Haast and others shows 4 overlapping phases  emergency, restoration, reconstruction 1, and reconstruction 2, which is similar to the UNDRR model. These PDR models are thoroughly discussed in the study.

According to the study, the Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) in developing countries is limited to the relief and rescue operations, thus failing to transition to subsequent phases like rehabilitation, restoration, and recovery, leading to a full and long-term recovery of a community.

The study finds that the post-disaster recovery in Sindh after the 2010 floods failed to transition to the long-term recovery phase.

The factors that hindered these transitions include the following:

The lack of community-level involvement  the state and relevant institutions failed to place communities at the centre of the recovery process,

Inadequate coping capacity, resource and skills of both the community and local administration which will impede their long-term recovery actions,

Absence of any recovery and reconstruction authority after the flood

No coherence or coordination in the PDR activities among stakeholders led to confusion between stakeholders and hindered the smooth transition of recovery, and

Lack of information and data among local administration and stakeholders led to politically motivating projects and aid distributions.

Through a better understanding of the smooth transition of the various phases of the PDR, the study can help policymakers and disaster management practitioners plan and implement effective PDR strategies, especially in developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate-related and natural disasters.",2021-04-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['longterm', 'postdisaster', 'relief', 'lessons', 'pakistan', 'recovery', '2010', 'pdr', 'reconstruction', 'flooding', 'study', 'floods', 'phases', 'transition', 'phase']",Pakistan,news article,English

CAIRO – 4 May 2018: As Egypt’s climate changes, heavy rainfall is becoming more and more common, bringing dangerous flash floods. Flash flooding can make the dry ground become saturated in an instant, allowing torrents of water to rush down mountains like a waterslide, wiping away cities.



According to a report issued by the Ministry of Irrigation, 11 governorates in Egypt are potentially vulnerable to flood risks, including Aswan, Luxor, Qena, Asyut, Sohag, Beni Suef, New Valley, and South and North Sinai.



The report also showed that the Red Sea and Suez governorates are included among the risk zones that may be exposed to floods. Even New Cairo, Helwan and Maadi are identified among the risk zones.



The Delta region is also at risk of torrential rain, but not to the level of being flooded. Sewer networks are needed to discharge rainwater, the report explained, adding that some towns are built on areas that are vulnerable to flood because of the limited available space in the Nile Delta governorates.



The report warned citizens not to encroach outfall facilities by building urban buildings without obtaining the appropriate licenses from the state agencies.



Egyptian Meteorological Authority Chairman Ahmed Abdelaal stated that the heavy rains that recently hit Egypt resulted from climate change, which is affecting the whole world.



Rainfall throughout the capital caused some buildings, houses and bridges to collapse; other governorates such as Suez, Ain Sokhna and Ismailia were also affected.



Climate change and its far-reaching impact is currently the subject of numerous discussions worldwide.



Egypt is an ideal example of a developing country that is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and faces numerous threats to its economic, social and environmental sustainability, including energy, water and food security.

1401,http://floodlist.com/africa/kenya-floods-may-2021,Scientists are worried about the impact of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes flooding - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scientists-worried-impact-kenya-rift-185025474.html,"Recent high water levels of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes have flooded properties and displaced communities, most notably around Lakes Baringo and Naivasha.

There are many lakes along the length of the African Rift Valley, which runs from the Red Sea in the north to Mozambique in the south. Kenyaâ??s eastern Rift Valley has a string of eight lakes.

These lakes provide diverse habitats ranging from the freshwater lakes of Naivasha and Baringo to the semi-saline Lake Turkana, the saline alkaline lakes of Magadi, Elmentaita, Nakuru, and Bogoria, and the transient Lake Logipi.

The alkaline lakes provide unique feeding habitats for East Africaâ??s famous lesser flamingos. The freshwater lakes support important fisheries and agriculture. Lake Turkanaâ??s unique semi-saline hydrobiology sustains indigenous fisheries, including some endemic species.

Some lakes are recognized as Wetlands of International Importance, and all are Important Bird Areas, with several being within UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites.

The lake level rises are worrying because of the destruction to homes, livelihoods, industry, and infrastructure, and loss of terrestrial wildlife habitat. So far this year, the rising waters of Lake Baringo alone have displaced more than 5,000 people and destroyed schools, hospitals, hotels, and roads.

10,000 years ago, Lake Turkana was 100 meters higher while Lakes Bogoria and Baringo had merged into one lake. Nakuru and Naivasha would have been under water.

And the effects on lake ecologies are a concern as flooding increases lake turbidity and dilutes the saline waters of alkaline lakes.

Having worked on East African hydrology for decades, including these lakes, I wanted to share insights on the rise in water levels.

The Rift Valley is subject to ongoing plate tectonics and crustal movement that can affect the lakes. The recent rises, though, are directly associated with above-average rainfall. The lakes have been even higher in the past, and with rainfall in the Rift Valley Basin being on a rising rainfall trend, higher lake levels can be expected in the future.

Story continues

Land use changes, riparian zone encroachment, loss of wetlands, and urban growth are all contributing to more extreme flooding. This is because the proportion of rain and sediment that runs off from the catchments is increasing.

Not unprecedented

The lakesâ?? water cycles are governed by rainfall on highland catchment areas, evaporation, and seepage. Water reaches the lakes through direct rainfall, rivers, groundwater flows, and in some cases hot springs from underground geothermal fields.

The eastern Rift Valley is semi-arid and its high evaporation rate concentrates salts in the lakes. The lakes are especially sensitive to changing catchment rainfall and have, in the past, ranged from near empty to much higher levels than today.

Flamingos crowd together in Lake Nakuru, Kenya, Aug. 27, 2020

The studies Iâ??m currently doing show, as have others, that there has been above-average annual rainfall over the last decade. Kenyaâ??s October to December 2019 rains were the highest on record for decades. These were followed by above-average rains in 2020. In some areas they were 400% more than normal.

With persistent rainfall, the catchment surface layers saturate, resulting in extended flood periods. For instance the Turkwel dam, which was built on the Turkwel river in the northern Rift Valley Basin, recently reached its highest level on record.

And in May this year, Lake Naivasha reached its highest level since 1932. The lakeâ??s expansion has flooded developments, such as surrounding flower farms.

Yet, like the other lakes, Lake Naivashaâ??s waters have historically been higher. The lake is 1.4 vertical meters short of its official riparian boundary. In 1917, the lake was 2.4 meters higher. In earlier centuries, the lake was at least 13 meters higher.

Lakes Nakuru, Bogoria, and Baringo have also risen to their highest levels in decades, inundating roads and building infrastructure, yet they also are not as high as they were in the early part of the last century. Lake Turkanaâ??s current level was also reached in the 1970s and early 1900s, and in 1896 it was 14.6 meters higher.

A photo showing a structure before it was submerged under rising water in Lake Baringo, Kenya, Aug. 25, 2020.

Regional lake water levels were higher still during the Holocene, up to 10,000 years before the present, during a wetter period. For instance, Lake Turkana was 100 meters higher and Lakes Bogoria and Baringo had risen high enough to merge into one lake. Present-day Nakuru and Naivasha townships would have been under water.

While this shows that the levels arenâ??t unprecedented, today all of Kenyaâ??s Rift Valley lakes face modern challenges arising from growing infrastructure development pressures.

Increasing pressure

The water cycles of Rift Valley lakes are changing as water is taken out for use and because the catchments and land surrounding the lakes are being degraded. For instance, forests are being converted into agricultural land, there is increasing urbanization and people are encroaching onto riparian and wetland zones.

These catchment changes reduce rainfall recharging of underground aquifers, and cause more sedimentâ??such as soilâ??to run off into rivers. This sediment reaches and accumulates in lakes and reservoirs. This can clog natural underground freshwater outlets, in which case lake salinity and levels will rise. The deposited sediments also build the lake beds and displace lake water levels upwards. I have measured up to 30 meters of sediment accumulated within Turkwel damâ??s reservoir since 1991.

Changes caused by people are different for different lakes.

Lake Nakuruâ??s ecology has long been affected by catchment change. For instance, the forest cover of its catchment area is reported to have declined from 70% to 15% over the past 50 years, leading to greater runoff into rivers and thence to the lake. On top of that, the growth of Nakuru town requires more water supply which will be imported. Unless otherwise channeled, this extra water will end up in the lake, raising water levels, and if not properly treated, will worsen pollution.

Meanwhile, Lake Naivasha declined in recent years to critically low levels. Growing developmentsâ??such as Naivasha town and a new Industrial Cityâ??need water, which puts more pressure on the already critically stressed lake water resource. In addition, the lake suffers from heavy pollution loads.

The flow of water into Lake Turkana is being regulated by dam and irrigation developments, potentially affecting the lake ecology and fisheries.

Excessive river inflows into the lakes result from increasing catchment rainfall coupled with the effects of land use changes. Dilution of saline waters affects the production of cyanobacteria, the food sources of lesser flamingos. Increased turbidity reduces light penetration into water, and affects photosynthesis, an engine of the aquatic food chain.

Future concerns

While tectonic plate changes are beyond humansâ?? control, biodiversity-friendly land use and commitment to existing legislation and national vegetation cover goals can limit catastrophic damage to lake ecological systems, people, and property.

In the context of increasing rainfall trends, it is vital that official demarcation of riparian and wetland zones takes full account of the very well-documented extreme high lake level precedents and extent of flooding of the last century and before.

520,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,"Chelsea News: Mason Mount scored the first Premier League goal of Frank Lampard era, breaking a pair of long Blues droughts - Goal",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mount-snaps-23-year-chelsea-drought-with-first-blues-goal/1uyoabqarzvib1nszabowozyfe,"Mount snaps 23-year Chelsea drought with first Blues goal

The 20-year-old became the first Englishman to score a goal for the Blues under an English manager since before he was born

Mason Mount scored the first Premier League goal of the Frank Lampard era in putting Chelsea 1-0 up against Leicester City on Sunday evening.

The 20-year-old scored after dispossessing Foxes midfielder Wilfred Ndidi on the edge of the box before slotting past Kasper Schmeichel, despite Ndidi’s desperate attempts to rectify his error.

It was a welcome sight for the Chelsea faithful, after Blues lost their opening game of the season 4-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford.

With his goal, the England Under-21 international became the first English-born player to score a goal for the Blues under an English manager since 1996.

Dennis Wise was the scorer on that occasion with former England manager Glenn Hoddle in the dugout at Stamford Bridge.

Since Hoddle left the club soon after Wise’s goal, three English managers have taken the reins in west London, but all on a temporary basis.

Graham Rix was in charge for two games in 2000, with Ray Wilkins and Steve Holland each managing for one game, in 2009 and 2015 respectively.

Mount, who was born in 1999, achieved another feat not seen in his lifetime.

The academy product is the first English player to score in his first appearance in front of the Chelsea faithful since Paul Hughes in January 1997, according to Opta.

Mount will hope his goal is the first of many, but Hughes only managed one more for the club, and was loaned to Stockport County at the beginning of the next season.

Mount played last season for Lampard too, for Derby County in the Championship while on-loan from Chelsea.

He scored on his debut for the Rams last year and has now done the same on his home debut in the Premier League.

Mount made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford, playing all 90 minutes in a chastening defeat and then came off the bench in the Blues game against Liverpool in the European Super Cup on Wednesday.

He scored his penalty in the shoot-out in that game, after the two teams could not be separated, the game ending 2-2 after extra time.

The Blues lost the shoot-out as fellow youngster Tammy Abraham’s miss from 12 yards handed the trophy to the Mersyside outfit.

And Sunday would prove disappointing for Chelsea as well, with Ndidi making up for his earlier mistake with a second-half equaliser, leaving the Blues to settle for a 1-1 draw.",2019-08-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['mason', 'game', 'score', 'blues', 'frank', 'pair', 'english', 'long', 'lampard', 'goal', 'league', 'premier', 'player', 'scored', 'chelsea', 'manager', 'mount']",Ghana,news article,English
571,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Fabian Delph: Winning a trophy for Everton is my No 1 aim after Manchester City exit - Sky Sports,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11768963/fabian-delph-winning-a-trophy-for-everton-is-my-no-1-aim-after-manchester-city-exit,"New Everton signing Fabian Delph says ending the club's 24-year trophy drought is his main aim, and insists he can bring the experience necessary.

The 29-year-old joined the Toffees on a three-year deal from Manchester City, where he won the Premier League title twice under Pep Guardiola.

But Everton are without a piece of silverware since the 1995 FA Cup, a drought their fans are acutely aware of, and Delph says correcting that is top of his list of priorities.

""I've been fortunate enough to be in a squad full of winning mentality,"" Delph said in his first press conference since joining. ""I'm not going to change coming here. The main goal is to be successful and win something.

""I'm aware the club hasn't won something in a long time. That's top of my list to hopefully try and push the lads and them to push me and win something.

Image: Delph hadn't started for City since he was sent off at Leicester in December

""[The winning mentality] probably comes easier to me because I'm one of the older players. You don't have to be the best player in the team to influence people, to drive and to set standards high with good habits.

""The winning mentality is massive. Everyone needs to be on it and have that mentality in training. There's no egos here. A great work ethic and the staff are fantastic.""

Despite being a big part of Guardiola's successful City side throughout 2017 and 2018, Delph has not started in the Premier League since he was sent off in a defeat at Leicester last December.

City went on to win the title, and though Delph admits his last six months with the club were frustrating, he insists he stayed professional throughout.

""Really frustrating, from a very young age all you want to do is play. I had a great spell the season before, where I was playing pretty much every game. Obviously I got sent off and didn't feature. It's been frustrating.

""But I'm very professional, I got my distances up and did everything I could to get back in the team. I made myself available, and the team were in a very good place, but unfortunately I didn't feature.""",2019-07-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['city', 'exit', 'everton', 'won', 'winning', 'im', 'title', 'fabian', 'sent', 'mentality', 'delph', 'team', 'trophy', 'manchester', 'aim', 'win']",Ghana,news article,English

Praise or criticism?

""American parents and teachers use more compliments and encouragement to help a child develop,"" Chen says, adding it's the opposite for Chinese parents.

Chen's elder son Liu Changhao studies at an elementary school in Iowa City, so he learns the American way at school, but returns to a Chinese home.

""Sometimes he is confused about the different ways,"" Chen says. ""When he expects to get praise, it's not always the case.""

Aumer says her Chinese mother never says things like, ""Congratulations"", or, ""I am proud of you"", but her American father says things like, ""Good job, honey"".

Zhang Yuping, from China and the mother of a 17-year-old boy and 9-year-old daughter, says that when she receives her children's course results she tends to concentrate on their failings.

""When I point out what they didn't do well, my children always say, 'Mom, why don't you praise me for what I have done well?'"" Zhang says.

More authoritarian

Li Xiaomei's daughter, who was born in China and grew up in the US, was slapped on the face by her father when she refused to change her clothes.

Li's husband thought her then 13-year-old daughter's clothes were too revealing for her age and asked her to change into the clothes they bought her in China. She said no and added that he had no right to slap her.

Generally, Chinese parents are more authoritarian compared to American parents and expect their children to respect and obey, while American parents tend to see their children more as equals.

""For my mother, I think it's hard because she grew up in a completely different environment,"" Aumer says. ""I am not always obedient.""

She says she's not frightened of speaking her mind, but her mom usually retorts, ""You shouldn't talk to your mom like that.""

Josie Liu, the Chinese mother of a 4-year-old daughter, says she has adjusted her parenting to fit in with the US.

""When I grew up, my parents were pretty authoritarian,"" Liu says, adding she has to be more ""polite"" with her daughter in the US and instead of saying, ""Hey, you have to do this,"" she asks, ""Can you do this?""

Fostering independence

""Chinese parents are more likely to think children are vulnerable and dependent,"" says Chen Shuang, a Chinese history professor at the University of Iowa.

He says Chinese parents will do everything they can for their children instead of encouraging them to develop independence. Typically, they feed their children up to the age of 3.

Joyce Long, an American mother and wife of a staff representative of the Christian organization The Navigators, agrees with Chen.

She has worked with and advised Chinese parents in Iowa City for 16 years. She says the goal of an American family is for children to feed themselves as early as possible while Chinese families follow children around or put them in a high chair to feed them.

Long says Americans will let children play by themselves, while Chinese parents feel someone should hold the child or be with the child all the time.

Great expectations

""Why didn't you get first?"" was the response Aumer got when she called her mother telling her that she got a second-place award for her photos from the Iowa Newspaper Foundation.

This attitude underlines the fact that Chinese parents are good at raising stereotypically successful kids, as they are strict about their children's studies and have high expectations.

Liu Dongwang, the associate director of the Center for Asian and Pacific Studies, says he was not very successful raising his daughter, who will start her studies at the University of Iowa in the fall of 2011.

""She can only attend the University of Iowa,"" Liu says. ""I hoped she would have been admitted to one of those elite schools, and I would sell my house to pay for it if necessary.""

Long says Chinese parents not only want their children to do well academically, they also want them to excel at other things. Like Amy Chua's children, they often expect them to take piano or violin lessons at a young age and practice for a long time.

""I believe they want their children to become really skilled,"" Long says. ""Maybe it's part of the value system to do everything well.""

While Chinese parents expect their children to excel at what they do, American parents prefer their children to enjoy what they do. ""I would practice piano if I liked it,"" Aumer says.

But for her mother, practicing piano is not just a hobby and she demands that it is taken seriously. ""Looking back, I should have listened to my mother,"" Aumer continues. ""I wish I had listened to her and kept practicing and not let my father intervene. I would be much better now.""

Testing the limits

When a bunch of Chinese mothers gather together, they will most likely talk about their children.

""Americans don't usually ask somebody how their child did on a test like the ACT college entrance exam unless they're really good friends,"" Long says. ""Chinese parents fee free to ask such questions.""

Long says Chinese parents will compare their kids, even in front of them, which she believes can be hurtful.

Chinese parents, however, believe it motivates their children.

""Sometimes I will ask my children about their friends' scores when I see their transcripts,"" says mother Zhang Yuping. ""Often they will tell me it is not right to compare them.""

Aumer says she is always being compared with her sisters. Though she is the tallest girl in the family she is also the fattest and she hates being told to lose weight all the time.

""When I tell my friends (about this) they are shocked,"" Aumer says. ""But I don't take offence because I know she (mom) doesn't mean it.""

Confucian culture

""I guess Americans believe a kid should be independent,"" says Chen Tingting, but Chinese families are often dominated by Confucian ideas, which means a child has obligations to the entire family.

Chinese parents want their children to be successful mainly for their children's own good, but they also want their children to bring honor to the family.

""I'm not supposed to be over critical of my son. But sometimes I am still influenced by the Chinese way of thinking, so that I feel I lose face because my son is not behaving well,"" the mother says.

""I try to avoid thinking that my son is part of me,"" she says.

A middle way

Despite the huge differences between American and Chinese parenting styles, when Chinese raise their children in the US, they will gradually incorporate some of their values.

""Before we came here, the way we educated our kids and the way Americans do is like different tracks,"" Chen Tingting says. ""Now it seems those tracks are getting closer to each other.""

She is searching for a middle way between the two cultures and says though she does not want to raise her kids exactly like typical Americans, she is influenced by them.

""We do try to give more encouragement to our kids,"" Chen says, but change is not always easy. ""I am Chinese. Some concepts are deeply rooted.""

Raising kids in another culture, however, does have its benefits. Joyce Long says whenever somebody lives in a new country, they can always pick up some of the good aspects from that culture and at the same time, keep some of the good values of their own culture.

By searching for a middle way these parents search for the right way and the best of both worlds.

943,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Provinces asking feds for $138 million to help buy out flooded properties - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/provinces-asking-feds-for-138-million-to-help-buy-out-flooded-properties-1.4424615,"OTTAWA -- Flood-ravaged provinces are asking the federal government to provide almost $138 million to move or buy out homeowners affected by previous years' inundations, according to new data that gives a glimpse into the national costs of helping residents leave floodplains.

Calculations based on previous experience suggest that the total cost of giving up on 100,000 of the most endangered structures could run into the billions.

Only four times in the past decade have provinces turned to the federal treasury for help to move homes -- twice in New Brunswick, and once each in Quebec and Yukon.

In New Brunswick's case, the federal government picked up more than 80 per cent of the $1.8 million spent to buy out a combined 36 properties after flooding in 2008 and 2010.

Public Safety Canada says provinces and territories have asked for $137.9 million in federal money to help cover costs related to 10 floods, but the dollar figure is only an estimate and doesn't include this year's.

The department says it expects to get more requests for financial help to relocate homes as the frequency of extreme flooding increases and wants to know how much provinces and territories have spent on it without federal help.

All that data will feed into a debate governments are having about whether it's better to move people off floodplains rather than repeatedly pay for repairs.

Federal help for disaster relief kicks in once costs surpass what lower levels of government could reasonably be expected to cover on their own.

Within the program, called the ""Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements,"" is a provision that allows provinces to claim the cost of relocating residents to areas less prone to floods or other disasters. Federal funding can also be used to buy out affected homeowners and dismantle damaged buildings.

How much gets doled out depends on the design of the buyout program, which has become a point in discussions between Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and his provincial and territorial counterparts.

A program could provide money up to a pre-set maximum, which is what Quebec's government is offering this year -- up to $200,000 to anyone with severe damage to their homes. Or it could pay the full estimated value of a home before it was flooded, as Alberta did after flooding there in 2013.

In that case, about one-third of homeowners who were offered buyouts took them within a year of the offer, costing the province $81 million in 2014. Alberta covered the bill itself, without federal assistance.

Based on the data available, the federal government has paid, on average, about $41,000 for each property owner who accepted previous buyouts in New Brunswick.

This year, New Brunswick is offering up to $160,000 for each home where damage exceeds 80 per cent of its pre-flood value. Owners can sell their buildings and have them demolished and levelled but retain their land. They can also sell out entirely, or take up to $160,000 to use on repairs -- in exchange for giving up any future disaster aid.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates about 100,000 homes -- out of the 14 million dwellings Statistics Canada counted in the 2016 census -- are at the highest risk of repeat flood damage. A buyout program for those properties could cost the federal treasury hundreds of millions of dollars based on the limited information available about previous federal disaster help, in addition to what provincial governments put up.

""No government bailout program or insurance program is going to be able to deal with those repeated cases where you're going to have repeated claims in a short period of time. That's where you may focus buyouts,"" said Craig Stewart, vice-president of federal affairs with the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

""In our view, the calculation is buy out a few and then protect and insure the rest.""",2019-05-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['federal', 'properties', 'buy', 'program', 'asking', 'disaster', 'feds', 'provinces', 'million', 'homes', 'flooded', 'help', 'previous', '138', 'insurance']",Canada,news article,English

But there are other places that have also been feeling the wrath of Mother Nature.

We start in east Africa. A place that has been inundated with recently heavy rain. Several countries in this region have been particularly hit hard.

Many have been uprooted from their homes as rivers have been rising. Water-logged farms have considerable crop damage. Unfortunately, the heavy has taken the life of at least 15 in Somalia. Parts of this region are still favored to see above-average rainfall.

There are other regions around the world seeing too much rain… and this time head to Afghanistan. An area known for its dry climate is now dealing with catastrophic flooding. According to the countries disaster agency, at least fifty people have died.

Next, we go from flooding to droughts. Hailed as one of the raniest places on earth, Taiwan is now in a devstating dry spell. Many farmers there have had to give up on farming this year and the water has been rationed for residents and businesses.

Now on to the drought in the U.S. As you can tell by ths colorful map, millions of Americans are affected by the drought Over half of the United States is considered abornally dry or in a drought.



California has been so dry, that recently a giant sequoia tree was found still smoldering from a fire in 2020. Officials are warning that this year’s California wildfire season could be one of the worst on record with already more acreage burned this year over last year at this time with nearly two thousand fires already recorded.

While we’re headed around the globe, a few interesting facts about the last 24 hours… the hottest place on earth was Nuwasib, Kuwait at 117°. The coldest place was Concordia, Antarctica at -105°. If you’re wondering what the wettest place on earth was in the last 24 hours, well that was in Thiruvananthapuram, India with 6.56″

554,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Hydrophobic nanostructured wood membrane for thermally efficient distillation - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw3203,"Current membrane distillation (MD) is challenged by the inefficiency of water thermal separation from dissolved solutes, controlled by membrane porosity and thermal conductivity. Existing petroleum-derived polymeric membranes face major development barriers. Here, we demonstrate a first robust MD membrane directly fabricated from sustainable wood material. The hydrophobic nanowood membrane had high porosity (89 ± 3%) and hierarchical pore structure with a wide pore size distribution of crystalline cellulose nanofibrils and xylem vessels and lumina (channels) that facilitate water vapor transportation. The thermal conductivity was extremely low in the transverse direction, which reduces conductive heat transport. However, high thermal conductivity along the fiber enables efficient thermal dissipation along the axial direction. As a result, the membrane demonstrated excellent intrinsic vapor permeability (1.44 ± 0.09 kg m −1 K −1 s −1 Pa −1 ) and thermal efficiency (~70% at 60°C). The properties of thermal efficiency, water flux, scalability, and sustainability make nanowood highly desirable for MD applications.

In this study, we developed the first robust MD membrane directly from a sustainable wood material. Nanocellulose is an earth-abundant and, oftentimes, waste biomass source that has been used in products with minimal environmental and health impacts such as construction materials, body armor, biofuels, or water filters ( 33 – 39 ). Most nanocellulose-based products, such as paper (fig. S4), are from wood pulp, where degraded cellulose fibers are randomly mixed together to form an isotropic structure with high density (1.20 g cm −3 ) and lower mechanical strength (0.25 to 0.30 MPa) ( 40 , 41 ). In contrast, this new wood membrane was made by directly removing lignin and semicellulose via chemical treatment and freeze-drying, which allowed the preservation of the anisotropic microstructure and hierarchical alignment of wood fibers. As a result, the wood can be prepared into an anisotropic and thermally insulating bulk material with extremely high porosity (~90%), low thermal conductivity (~0.04 W m −1 K −1 ), and good mechanical strength (18 MPa), making it an ideal substrate for MD membrane. In this study, we report a nanostructured wood (i.e., nanowood) from natural American basswood followed by silane coating, which resulted in a hydrophobic nanowood membrane with high porosity yet very low thermal conductivity. The highly porous structure with naturally formed pores either amid the nanofibrils or growing on the wood vessels and fibril tracheid lumens (pits) reduces the water vapor transfer resistance and provides good water flux (20.8 ± 0.8 kg m −2 hour −1 at 60°C) in direct contact MD (DCMD) tests ( Fig. 1 ). The anisotropic property can allow heat to spread along the nanofibril direction and reduce the conductive heat transfer, while the high intrinsic permeability enhances water vapor transfer and, thus, convective heat transfer. Together, these grant the membrane excellent thermal efficiency (71 ± 2% at 60°C) with one of the highest values among all the reported MD membranes in literature ( 22 ). The hydrophobic wood membranes were also compared with commercial membranes in terms of membrane structures [e.g., pore size distribution (PSD) and thermal conductivity] and MD performance (i.e., flux, vapor permeability, and thermal efficiency). Figure 1B shows a large piece of the nanowood membrane with a length of 18 cm, which demonstrates the scalability of the wood membrane fabrication process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a hydrophobic MD membrane made from a sustainable wood material.

Current commercial MD membranes are made of synthetic polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polypropylene (PP) ( 16 , 25 – 27 ). In general, these membranes have porosities lower than 0.80, thermal conductivities higher than 0.050 W m −1 K −1 , and thermal efficiency up to 60% ( 10 , 15 , 16 , 22 , 25 , 28 ). For example, the microporous PTFE membranes are widely used in MD modules owing to their high hydrophobicity and stability ( 26 ), but many of these membranes are typically isotropic (fig. S4) and not ideal for highly effective thermal insulation ( 29 – 31 ). In addition, these polymer materials are derived from petroleum products, and their use and disposal generate environmental concerns due to low biodegradability ( 32 ). Therefore, MD membranes made from natural and low-cost materials with high thermal stability and hydrophobicity are highly desired, yet not available. Recently, Leitch et al. ( 24 ) presented a new bacterial nanocellulose aerogel MD membrane with high porosity (>98%) and low thermal conductivity (<0.03 W m −1 K −1 ), demonstrating how membranes could be fabricated using natural materials.

Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging thermally driven separation process with great potential for high-salinity water desalination using solar, thermal or other renewable sources ( 10 ). Driven by difference in temperature and vapor pressure. Water evaporates at the hot feed side of MD cells and diffuses through a porous hydrophobic membrane before condensing at the cold permeate side ( 14 – 16 ). MD can be operated using low-grade heat such as condenser cooling water from thermal power plants or, increasingly, from renewable sources such as solar thermal or geothermal plants ( 17 – 19 ). During MD, the transport of water vapor leads to the convective heat transfer, where the heat partially conducts through the membrane materials thereby reducing temperature gradient and lowering the driving force for mass transfer across the membrane ( 20 , 21 ). Thermal efficiency is an important parameter in MD and is defined as the convective heat flux across the membrane divided by the total heat flux ( 22 ). Accordingly, an ideal MD membrane would have a desired combination of characteristics, such as large pore size, low pore tortuosity, low thermal conductivity, high porosity, optimized thickness, good mechanical strength, cost competitiveness, and low environmental impacts ( 10 , 22 – 24 ).

Water scarcity is a worldwide grand challenge. The United Nations reported this year that nearly half of the global population (~3.6 billion) are currently living in potential water-scarce regions at least 1 month per year. This number could increase to between 4.8-5.7 billion by 2050 ( 1 ). This problem is exacerbated by climate change and rapid urbanization, evidenced by extensive periods of drought and more frequent wildfires in California and other regions ( 2 – 4 ). Desalination can help alleviate water stress by extracting fresh water from a range of saline or contaminated sources including seawater, brackish groundwater, or wastewater ( 5 , 6 ), and the development of desalination has been greatly boosted by nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing ( 7 , 8 ). However, although reaching its energy efficiency limit (~50%), current water desalination processes such as reverse osmosis are still energy intensive [2 to 4 kilowatt-hour m −3 ] ( 9 , 10 ). However, in many regions that can benefit from the technology, an increasing supply of renewable yet intermittent solar energy in the format of heat or electricity generates great opportunities for solar desalination, which also mitigate challenges in energy storage. By taking advantage of this low-cost and sometimes excess supply of heat or electrical energy, water desalination can become more cost effective ( 11 – 13 ).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The unique porous structure of the hydrophobic nanostructure wood as a highly efficient membrane The hydrophobic wood membranes (Fig. 2, A, B and C and Fig. 3, A and B) were directly derived from natural American basswood, in which amorphous lignin and hemicellulose are intertwined with cellulose nanofibrils (42). After chemical treatment and purification, as described in Materials and Methods, we preserved the wood microstructure and the hierarchical alignment. For the nanowood membrane, lignin and hemicellulose were removed, while the naturally aligned cellulose nanofibrils isolated from each other along the growth direction can be directly observed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2, D to H). The removal of intermixed lignin and hemicellulose for the nanowood membrane greatly reduced the linkage and interaction among cellulose fibrils and the fibril aggregates within the fibril wall, which greatly increased flexibility and porosity (39). The resulting aligned crystalline cellulose nanofibrils were held together by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces (43). Presumably, this aligned structure with weakened interactions would reduce the thermal conductivity in the transverse direction, thereby mitigating the heat loss via the conductive heat transfer during MD.

Hou, University of Colorado. Different from commercial membranes with vertical pores (e.g., finger-like structure; fig. S7) (26), the wood membranes presented a unique pore structure with naturally formed xylem vessels and lumina (channels) in parallel to the membrane surface (Fig. 2D). The channel diameters ranged from 10 to 100 μm, and the channel pores granted the hydrophobic natural wood membrane a porous structure with a porosity of 21 ± 3%. Impressively, the removal of intermixed lignin and hemicellulose contributed to ~70% mass loss in the wood structure and, thus, further improved the porosity more than four times from 21 ± 3 to 89 ± 3% for the hydrophobic nanowood membrane. Note that the porosity of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane was also larger than that of commercial membranes, of which the porosity ranged from 41 to 85% (Table 1) (10, 15, 22, 25, 28). In addition to porosity augmentation, the removal of lignin and hemicellulose greatly shifted the PSD to the right (Fig. 2I) and increased the average pore size by ~56% from 0.18 ± 0.02 to 0.28 ± 0.03 μm (Table 1). We observed the obtained pore structure of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane using SEM (Fig. 2, D to H). Along the cross-sectional direction, we also detected micropores amid the crystalline cellulose nanofibrils (<100 nm; Fig. 2F). Apart from the pores between nanofibrils, we also observed a large amount of mesopores (pits) growing on the xylem vessels and lumina (5 to 10 μm; Fig. 2, E, G, and H), which were used for water and nutrient delivery during tree growth. This study takes advantage of the gas transportation property of these pores located either between the nanofibrils or on the channel walls for water vapor transportation. The unique pore structure of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane resulted in the nonuniform PSD with several peaks, which were totally different from the commercial PP and PTFE membranes with very uniform PSDs (fig. S6). Benefiting from the large porosity, the theoretical thermal conductivity of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane was decreased from 0.210 to 0.040 W m−1 K−1 at 25°C (section S12), which would contribute to conductive heat loss reduction. Moreover, different from the commercial membranes with isotropic structures and intertwined fibers (fig. S7), the aligned and high–aspect ratio nanofibril channels led to anisotropic heat flow along the alignment direction rather than the cross-sectional direction, which can further prevent the heat transfer across the wood membrane (39). In addition, the increased pore size and porosity were hypothesized to improve vapor permeability and enhance water flux (section 12), thereby increasing convective heat transfer (10). Table 1 Characteristic comparisons of the new wood membranes and commercial polymeric membranes. LEP, liquid entry pressure; ECTFE, ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene. View this table: As shown in Fig. 2C and fig. S8, both the hydrophobic nanowood membrane and natural wood membrane had water contact angles greater than 140°, indicating that the initially highly hydrophilic wood substrate (i.e., no measurable water contact angle) was successfully modified to be hydrophobic after surface fluorination. The hydrophobicity of the treated wood membranes was better than those commercial membranes with PTFE or PP substrate, where the contact angles were lower than 130° (Table 1) (22, 26). The excellent hydrophobicity of the wood membranes was attributed to fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) treatment, which has super low surface energy (13.1 mN m−1) compared to PTFE (20 mN m−1) and PP (30 mN m−1) (26, 44). Note that the surface morphologies and pore structure did not change before and after surface fluorination by FAS (fig. S2). Owing to the good hydrophobicity and relatively small pore size, the nanowood membrane demonstrated decent liquid entry pressure (LEP; ~74.7 ± 0.5 kPa), suggesting a better resistance to membrane wetting than the commercial PP membranes. However, it was noted that the nanowood membrane showed smaller LEP than the PTFE membrane (~130 kPa). This is due to the wide PSD of the nanowood membrane, as larger pores (>0.4 μm) may exert negative effects (45).

Thermal conductivity characterization of the nanowood membrane To demonstrate the thermal insulation capabilities of the fabricated hydrophobic nanowood membrane, we tested the specimens under a conductive heat source to simulate the DCMD. We measured the temperature with an infrared radiation (IR) camera (Fig. 3). Five different temperatures were applied, and the results show that the hydrophobic nanowood membrane yielded lower backside temperature than the hydrophobic natural wood membrane, attributed to its low thermal conductivity and anisotropic property (39). The thermal conductivity of both nanowood and natural wood increased gradually from 0.210 to 0.270 W m−1 K−1 and from 0.040 to 0.049 W m−1 K−1, respectively, with the escalation of the heat source temperature from 40° to 60°C (Fig. 3E). This is assumed because of the increase in conductivity of the cell wall substances rather than the increase in gas phase conductivity or the radiative conductivity (46). The trend was more notable for the natural wood (29%) than for nanowood (23%) due to the presence of hemicellulose and lignin, which are of less thermal stability (47). The measured thermal conductivity was comparable to the theoretical values (section S12), which are 0.184 and 0.037 W m−1 K−1 at 25°C for natural wood and nanowood membranes, respectively. The nanowood membrane showed lower thermal conductivity than most of the commercial membranes, whose thermal conductivity is generally higher than 0.045 W m−1 K−1. This lower thermal conductivity was believed to reduce the conductive heat loss during MD and maintain the effective temperature gradient across the membrane. When heated by a conductive heat source at 60°C, it was shown that the stabilized backside temperature of the hydrophobic natural wood was 47°C, whereas that of the hydrophobic nanowood was 43°C, under 200 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3D). This directly indicated that the nanowood exhibited better thermal insulation property or less conductive heat loss than the natural wood. Accordingly, the thermal conductivity of the nanowood membrane was 0.049 ± 0.002 W m−1 K−1 at 60°C (Fig. 3E), which was only 18% of the thermal conductivity of the natural wood membrane (0.270 ± 0.005 W m−1 K−1 at 60°C). This significantly lower thermal conductivity of nanowood membrane was attributed not only to the higher porosity (89 ± 3% versus 21 ± 3%) but also to bigger pore size (0.28 ± 0.03 μm versus 0.18 ± 0.02 μm). Previous study indicated that higher interspacing (pore size) between fibers than the mean free path of air can mitigate thermal conduction through air. The reduction of microsized and nanosized pores is appreciable for further reduction of thermal conductivity (39). Furthermore, hemicellulose (0.34 W m−1 K−1) and lignin (0.39 W m−1 K−1) carried higher thermal conductivity than the nanocrystalline cellulose (0.26 W m−1 K−1). Therefore, the removal of intermixed lignin and hemicellulose greatly reduced the bulk thermal conductivity of nanowood. Note that the hydrophobic treatment with FAS did not result in significant change of the thermal conductivity of the wood (Fig. 3F).",2019-08-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['thermal', 'heat', 'conductivity', 'membrane', 'hydrophobic', 'water', 'membranes', 'nanowood', 'distillation', 'fig', 'efficient', 'thermally', 'nanostructured', 'wood']",Ghana,news article,English

Like many people on New Yearâ??s eve, I was very hopeful that 2021 could bring hope and change especially after a very challenging pandemic year. I was excited at the prospect of leaving my lockdown life behind, to see family and loved ones- to finally live and experience life without fear. Unfortunately, things have not changed much for most of the world. The â??new normalâ?? is normal now.

While Covid-19 remains a threat, many of us forgot about the other bigger threat to humanity. A looming monster that has been around for much longer putting millions in harmâ??s way. Unfortunately, there is no cure yet for this menace and once again, the world needs to tackle this problem collectively, head-on.



At the start of 2021, the world was beset by climate emergencies one after another. We have seen extreme weather events, from the chilling polar vortex in North America, the super cyclones in Africa, to the devastating floods in Australia and parts of Asia. There were also record-breaking sandstorms and unprecedented wildfires.



Scientists have long sounded the alarm on the climate crisis. Until world governments come together and commit to ambitious action for climate and social equity, no one is safe.

Over several days, strong winds and torrential rains caused huge damage, submerging homes, wiping out farmland, killing and sweeping away cattle. The Diocese of H Tinh, along with Caritas and the Catholic Business Association brought donations.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) - Strong winds and torrential rain over several days have caused flooding in central Vietnam, killing at least 37 so far. Qu?ng Tr?, Th?a Thin Hu? and Qu?ng Nam are the most affected provinces.

Heavy rains from 10 to 13 October inundated residential areas, farmland and roads, causing huge damages to people and property.

The General Department of Disaster Prevention reported that, in addition to the 37 deaths, at least 50,000 houses were flooded or wrecked whilst 250 hectares of rice fields and 2,500 hectares planted with vegetables were wiped out. Some 900 hectares dedicated to aquaculture were also damaged; at least 60,000 animals, mainly cows and poultry, were killed or swept away by the raging waters.

Bishop Phaol (Paul) Nguy?n Thi H?p of H Tinh (about 340 km south of the capital, near the coast), decided to visit the flooded areas to bring some help. On Saturday, he led a delegation from his diocese to Trung Qun parish.

The prelate tried to visit every family, one by one, to encourage them and leave them with some small gifts. For those who met him, He is a true pastor. He did not just give us some gifts; he brought us God.

Trung Qun parish, one of the hardest hit, saw homes submerged and streets turned into rivers.

200,FF-2016-000062-IDN,How time-poor scientists inadvertently made it seem like the world was overrun with jellyfish - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/how-time-poor-scientists-inadvertently-made-it-seem-like-the-world-was-overrun-with-jellyfish-61564,"When is a jellyfish plague not (necessarily) a jellyfish plague? When time-poor scientists selectively cite the literature to make it look like the oceans are flooded with jellies – even when it’s far from clear that they really are.

What does scientists being in a rush have to do with jellyfish populations? Let’s start from the beginning.

The identification of patterns and trends in nature happens through the accumulation of consistent observations, published in scientific reports. Once observed, the emerging patterns are usually reported in narrative reviews, which often stimulates a flurry of research activity in that field.

Eventually, the purported patterns are formally tested using “meta-analyses” of the published literature, to either confirm the pattern and establish it as theory, or refute it.

This path from the primary observations to theory can be traced through a network of citations.

Science, however, is done by humans and citation practices are subject to errors of bias and accuracy. Citation practices that are biased in a particular direction have the potential to lead to the identification of false patterns and flawed theory.

Enter the jellies

In the 1990s and 2000s, reports began to appear in the scientific literature of increased jellyfish populations in some parts of the world’s oceans. Various reviews reported the possibility that jellyfish blooms might be increasing globally. Over time, these became increasingly assertive about the existence and extent of the trend, until researchers were asking what to do about the increasingly “gelatinous state” of the oceans worldwide.

The question of whether the global jellyfish boom was real or not was tested by two meta-analyses – which came to opposite conclusions. A 2012 study concluded that populations were increasing globally because they found evidence for increasing populations in 62% of large marine ecosystems tested (although low certainty was assigned to two-thirds of these). The following year, another study found that only 30% of populations were increasing. It concluded that jellyfish populations wax and wane over several decades.

So, in reality, the scientific community is still divided over whether there really has been a sustained global increase in jellyfish numbers.

What about perception?

We wanted to know whether the perception of a global increase in jellyfish blooms was at least partly due to poor citation practices in the scientific literature. Our research, published in Global Ecology and Biogeography, suggests that it was.

Citation practices can be flawed in several ways:

Unsupported citations are when authors cite sources that contain no evidence that could possibly support the author’s claim.

Selective citations happen when a paper is cited to support a claim but contrasting evidence provided in the same paper is ignored, or when authors choose to cite earlier papers that have since been refuted.

Ambiguous citations happen when an author’s sentence contains multiple phrases, but the citations used to support each phrase are clustered at the end of the sentence, preventing readers from telling which is which.

Empty citations are when authors cite a paper that cites another paper as evidence for the claim, rather than the original source (also called “lazy author syndrome”).

We comprehensively searched the literature for papers, published before the two meta-analyses, that issued statements regarding trends in jellyfish populations. We classified each statement according to its affirmation and direction (that is, whether it said jellyfish are “increasing”, “may be increasing”, “decreasing”, or “not sure”), as well as their geographic extent (global, multiple regions, or one region).

We then assessed the papers cited as evidence of the statement, to see whether the citations were accurate or whether they fell into one of the categories of flawed citations outlined above.

A (jelly)fishy tale?

Of 159 papers that had issued statements about trends in jellyfish, 61% claimed that populations were increasing (27% at the global scale and 34% in multiple regions) and 25% asserted that populations may be increasing. Only 10% of papers said the data were equivocal. Just one reported that populations were decreasing (but at a local scale).

Most concerning was that only 51% of papers cited were considered to provide unambiguous support for the statements made by the authors. Almost all statements based on unsupportive citations were those claiming that jellyfish were increasing globally (despite the fact that it would have been impossible to make any claims about global trends before the first global meta-analysis was published in 2012). And in all cases, selective citations were biased towards claims that jellyfish populations were increasing.

Pressure to publish in prestigious journals and win research funds may lead some scientists to make claims that reach beyond the evidence available. In most cases, however, citation errors are not overt attempts to distort the evidence. Rather, they probably arise because increasing academic workloads reduce the time available to evaluate papers accurately and to keep abreast of the almost exponential increase in the volume of literature being published.

As scientists, we need to ensure that our claims are always supported by robust evidence because it is apparent that poor citation practices – and, in particular, selective citation of the literature – can distort perceptions within a research field.",2016-06-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['papers', 'evidence', 'scientists', 'global', 'timepoor', 'inadvertently', 'jellyfish', 'populations', 'overrun', 'increasing', 'literature', 'citations', 'citation', 'authors', 'world']",India,news article,English
1103,FL-2021-000030-IDN,These Carbon-Belching Zombie Fires Just Wouldn't Die—Until Now – Mother Jones - Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/03/these-carbon-belching-zombie-fires-refuse-to-die/,"Humanity’s got a full-tilt zombie outbreak on its hands. As the world warms and certain regions—particularly the Arctic—dry, so does the super fuel known as peat. It’s basically concentrated carbon from dead plants, and it burns not at all like your typical Californian or Australian wildfire. Instead of sending towering flames upward, a peat fire burns in the opposite direction, smoldering deep in the soil. Firefighters often soak the ground with water and declare victory, only for the soil to reignite a surface fire months later. The land might even snow over while the smoldering persists undetected. That’s why scientists dub these menaces “zombie fires.”

Peat fires can release 100 times the carbon that a wildfire does. That’s terrible for both the planet and human health: In Indonesia, which has massive stores of peat that regularly burn uncontrolled, the smoke creates public health crises. Since peat fire spreads down into the soil and across the landscape, they also threaten nearby farmlands and people.

Yet researchers have found a weapon that could help put down a zombie fire for good—the equivalent of destroying its brain instead of just mangling its body. “Smoldering is the most persistent type of combustion on earth, because it’s really easy to start and very difficult to stop,” says Imperial College London engineer Guillermo Rein, co-author of a new paper describing the work in the International Journal of Wildland Fire. “They call them zombie fires, but the equivalent would be like an army of zombies. They are very, very difficult to suppress.”

Just ask the firefighters who battled North Carolina’s Evans Road Fire in 2008, which simmered through swampy peatland. Engineers ended up pumping 7.5 billion liters of water from lakes to flood the area. It took seven months to drown the fire.

If you’ve got a big air tanker that can drop huge amounts of water on a zombie fire, good for you. But it’s not going to work. “No one fights smoldering fires, which are massive, with air tankers,” says Rein. “If they do, they’re doing PR. They’re telling everyone, ‘Don’t worry, we have it!’ But they don’t. They don’t. When I see these airplanes in a smoldering fire, I know they are completely desperate.”

That’s because deluging a zombie isn’t guaranteed to quickly kill it. Say you’re pumping massive quantities across a peatland like firefighters did in North Carolina. That doesn’t mean the water is getting to the right places as it trickles underground. “It creates a channel, and the fire in that channel is suppressed, but then the water doesn’t go anywhere else,” Rein says. Other parts of the fire can fester untouched. And so the zombie lives on.

If firefighters don’t have enough water at their disposal, they may try compacting the soil with heavy machinery in a bid to cut off the fire’s oxygen. But that equipment is not always available to a crew. Even then, such a maneuver is dangerous work since it requires driving over an active fire. Also, these fires can be huge, and heavy machinery can cover only so much ground.

In the lab, Rein and his colleagues experimented with a novel anti-zombie weapon: water mixed with a nontoxic, readily available fire-extinguishing surfactant, also known as a wetting agent or suppressant. “It’s a little bit actually like soap—it just reduces the surface tension of the water and allows the water to penetrate better into a porous medium,” says Rein. “Peat is a porous medium.”

Using a small custom-built “peat reactor,” stuffed with the plant material and lined with ceramic insulators, they could set a zombie fire and monitor it as it burned. Above the box they situated a nozzle to spray either regular water or their special blend on different fires. Compared to the same amount of plain water, the water with surfactant cut the time needed to extinguish the blaze by 40 percent. Thanks to that decreased surface tension, instead of creating channels, the mixture more uniformly penetrated the soil, so little patches of zombie fire had nowhere to hide.

It wasn’t that the surfactant had some sort of chemical effect on the fire—for instance, by decreasing oxygen levels. Instead it was more of a thermal effect, “in the sense that the surfactant allows the water to reach more hot spots and reach them faster,” says Rein.

That’s promising because the less time a peat fire has to burn, the less land it will destroy and the fewer emissions it will spew. “If we have the ability to suppress these peat fires, that will help mitigate not only ground-level smoke pollution impacts but also the potential feedback with climate change where these deep, very prolonged, smoldering peat fires emit tons and tons of ancient carbon back into the atmosphere,” says Sophie Wilkinson, a wildfire scientist at McMaster University who studies peat fires but wasn’t involved in this new work.

For now, researchers have demonstrated the effect in the lab, but the next step is to try it on a controlled outdoor burn. Combined with the researchers’ previous work modeling how peat fires spread, the discovery could give firefighters a powerful weapon for putting down zombie fires. The team can build “what if” scenarios for, say, fighting fires burning in Indonesia, and offer advice on how to distribute resources when quashing a particular fire.

“There is no positive outcome of peat burning,” says Rein. “Now we have an understanding of how to suppress them.”",2021-03-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['rein', 'firefighters', 'peat', 'surfactant', 'smoldering', 'soil', 'work', 'wouldnt', 'zombie', 'dieuntil', 'fires', 'water', 'carbonbelching']",India,news article,English

364,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia: Hirshabelle state hits back at FGS over missing donor funds - Garowe Online,https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/somalia-hirshabelle-state-hits-back-at-fgs-over-missing-donor-funds,"Somalia: Hirshabelle state hits back at FGS over missing donor funds

MOGADISHU, Somalia - Somalia's regional state of Hirshabelle has accused the federal government of acting on ""self-defense"" to distort facts about missing donor funds, which were meant to mitigate floods and drought in several parts of the country

At least $135 million were dispatched to Somalia mainly through World Bank and the Hirshabelle state was set to get $35 million for 2020, but the money is yet to be dispatched, with most proposed beneficiaries shifting their wrath to the federal government.

Finance Minister Abdirahman Beileh and his Planning counterpart Ambassador Gamal Hassan refuted claims that the money is being held, arguing that most of it have been disbursed to relevant agencies and organizations for the tasks it had been allocated.

But in yet another bombshell, Hirshabelle state under President Ali Guldilawe, accused the federal government of ""hiding"" from facts, adding that at least nine months have elapsed since the state signed an MoU with the FGS over the release of the money.

The latest twist could complicate the relationship between Villa Somalia and Jowhar, which has often defended Mogadishu's lame federal policies, that have often put President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo at loggerheads with certain regional leaders.

On Sunday, a number of Senators led by Abdirahman Farole accused Farmajo of being an existential threat to federalism in the country. Farmajo, they said, prefers the centralism approach they insisted will further divide the people of Somalia.

Last week, Mohamed Abdi Waare, a former Hirshabelle president, accused the government of failing to release $35 million, adding that they were meant to mitigate floods along the Shebelle Valley, which is now the worst affected according to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [OCHA].

Although he didn't provide evidence, Waare, a former ally of Villa Somalia, said the money was donated by the governments of Italy, Sweden, the European Union, and the World Bank sometimes back, adding that it's yet to be released.

The money, he added, is held at the ministries of Finance, Planning, and Agriculture. He, however, did not specify when the money was disbursed and why it has taken long to have the money disbursed.

""It unfortunate that more than USD 35 million donated for the floods by Italy in Somalia, Sweden in Somalia EU_in_Somalia and World Bank for the Shabelle Valley alone is blocked at Federal Ministries of Finance, Planning, and Agriculture. Shame,"" he said in a tweet.

The Garowe Online could not establish the claims at that time but Waare, is one of the leaders who closely worked with Villa Somalia. He left his office early this year and was replaced by Ali Guudlaawe, a close associate of President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo.

This comes amid raging floods in the country At least 25 people have been killed in the past seven days due to heavy rains pounding several parts of Somalia, the United Nations humanitarian agency said in a statement on Sunday.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said among the dead include 14 children and seven internally displaced people.

OCHA said riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar in the Middle Shabelle region, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms.

The heavy rains have hit various parts of Somalia over the past week, triggering flash floods that have killed and displaced people, but a forecast suggests the rains will begin to subside from mid-May.

1204,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Lagos flood alert: Heeding the augurs - The Nation Newspaper,https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-flood-alert-heeding-the-augurs/,"By Kayode Ojewale

SIR: Flooding does not just suddenly happen; it is usually preceded by some occurrences hinting its imminent arrival. When the flow of rain water on its way to the drainage channels or river is impeded, then flooding occurs. Flooding is having too much water in the wrong place. The cause of flooding is mainly man-made because of our unclean environmental habits. With just few days of rains, some parts of Lagos are flooded. How will residents of these areas, especially flood-prone areas fare when the peak of rainy season which usually comes with attendant flooding eventually arrives? The omens of flooding are here with us coupled with the warnings issued by appropriate authorities; are we heeding the augurs?

Whats the end gain if the rains, meant to bless us and water our plants, turn out to damage our crops, properties and even destroy lives due to our actions and inactions? Does it appear many have forgotten the losses, pains and agony that accompanied the ravaging heavy rains which caused disasters in different parts of the country in 2012, the year of flood fury?

Of recent, it is observed that sometimes the rains no longer pre-inform or send any signal before its arrival through warnings like cloudy sky, windy atmosphere and dark clouds. Rather, it will just begin to rain suddenly without any pre-notification and it will pour heavily. Thats another indication that the rains this year would be in a different dimension.

On April 14, the Lagos State government predicted high intensity high of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello.

Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm.

It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding, he further added.

As a way of checkmating the looming flood, the state government plans to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72 kilometers spread across all the Local Government Areas of the State.

Flood alerts and warnings are usually issued to sensitize residents and the authorities on the need to prepare. Ignoring these warnings or not heeding the flood alerts may come with deadly consequences. In order to be prepared for the predicted floods, agencies in charge of disaster management and emergencies should be ready to ensure safety of lives during the peak of the rainy season.

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Natures fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.",2021-04-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['residents', 'rainy', 'warnings', 'water', 'flooding', 'flood', 'days', 'heeding', 'flow', 'lagos', 'alert', 'rains', 'state', 'areas', 'augurs']",Nigeria,news article,English

The national team outcast has reacted to the Black Stars failure at the continental showpiece

Ghanaian football player Kevin-Prince Boateng has taken a jab at the Black Stars following their exit from the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt on Monday.

The West Africans' hopes of ending a 37-year trophy drought ended following a 5-4 penalty shootout defeat against Tunisia in the Round of 16, the match having ended 1-1 after extra-time.

Boateng hasn't returned to the Black Stars squad after his behaviour was called into question at the 2014 Fifa World Cup in Brazil. The German-born player, who spent the second part of last season on loan at Barcelona, was snubbed for Afcon after indicating an interest to return to the national team.

""No PRINCE no PARTY, "" Boateng wrote on a Twitter post with the hashtags ""GhanaBlackStars"" and #Afcon.

Ahead of the Egypt gathering, Ghana Football Association Normalisation Committee chairman Kofi Amoah revealed Boateng, together with Sulley Muntari, who was also suspended during the controversial World Cup campaign, had expressed interest to be considered for the competition.

802,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Fears flood water runoff could 'smother' Barrier Reef - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/fears-flood-water-runoff-could-smother-barrier-reef/,"Runoff from recent floods in northern Australia is flowing onto parts of the Barrier Reef, scientists said Friday, starving coral of light and providing fodder for the predatory crown-of-thorns starfish.

Parts of northern Queensland are still reeling after nearly two weeks of unprecedented rainfall that turned roads into rivers and inundated hundreds of homes with floodwater.

Scientists at James Cook University say the floods swelled a number of rivers along hundreds of kilometers of coastline, spilling sediment onto the reef which has reduced water quality and much-needed sunlight.

“Coral reef and seagrass need light to maintain their growth and health,” researcher Jane Waterhouse from James Cook University told AFP.

Calm weather following the extended period of rain means the murky water is yet to disperse.

It threatens to “smother” coral in areas worst hit, like at the mouth of north Queensland’s Burdekin river, where a brown flood plume has spread some 100 kilometres offshore.

“If that were to stay there then eventually, it would not take that long for some of those systems to die off,” Waterhouse added.

The effects will not be fully understood until monitoring was completed over the next few of months after sediment has dispersed and settled.

The 2,300-kilometre (1,400-mile) reef has already suffered from back-to-back coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017, where swathes have been killed by rising sea temperatures linked to climate change.

The predatory crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat coral, have also proliferated on the reef due to pollution and agricultural runoff.

The recent floods have exacerbated the runoff, causing algae to grow in some areas.

“This provides a brilliant food source to allow those populations to thrive,” Waterhouse added.",2019-02-16 08:00:00+00:00,"['smother', 'flood', 'fears', 'floods', 'water', 'coral', 'rivers', 'sediment', 'university', 'waterhouse', 'reef', 'barrier', 'runoff', 'recent']",Egypt,news article,English
1216,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Parents of Pakistani man who died in NSW floods forced to watch burial through car window - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/05/parents-of-pakistani-man-who-died-in-nsw-floods-forced-to-watch-burial-through-car-window,"The parents of a man who died when his car was trapped in New South Wales flood waters have farewelled their son at a prayer service in Sydney after flying in from Pakistan.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was travelling to his first day at a new job on 24 March when his car got stuck in flood waters at Glenorie and he was unable to escape. He was on the phone to emergency services for almost 40 minutes before he died.

His grieving parents were given permission to enter Australia for the funeral. They arrived in Sydney on Sunday and followed strict protocols.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their sons body or coffin and were kept apart from Younuss friends due to Covid restrictions.

Younuss father, Muhammad Younus, was unable to address mourners but in a pre-recorded message broadcast at the service said the family was heartbroken.

When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him, the grieving father said.

I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents. I wished we could have hugged him once more. I wished we could have embraced him and kissed his forehead. But alas it didnt happen. Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.

Muhammad Younus said his son had spoken to his family about bringing them to Australia and showing them his new home.

Australia is a beautiful country and once you come here, Dad, I will show you around. These were the words of my dear son Ayaz whenever he used to call me, he said.

One day before his death, he was talking to his friend and telling him that now he would be doing double duty as a truck driver and also as an Uber driver, so he may bring his parents, brothers and sister here in Australia.

The father thanked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, for helping organise their attendance.

I wished my children could have been here with me also, to say goodbye to their beloved brother. I still hope and pray that one day they will be here to pay their respect and pray, standing at his grave.

Younus had three siblings  two older brothers and a younger sister  who were unable to attend the service and instead watched it on Zoom from Pakistan.

Younuss parents were confined to a car for the actual burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window. Muhammad Younus was briefly allowed outside the vehicle to shovel sand on his sons coffin.

The funeral was held at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australias mosque, the Baitul Huda mosque, in Marsden Park.

The association helped pay for the familys travel, accommodation and funeral costs because Younus was an active volunteer with the organisation.

Younuss coffin was earlier displayed in a hall for his friends and family to farewell him. When his parents arrived, the hall was emptied.

Younus was remembered as an active member of the local community who arrived in Australia two years ago. He had volunteered to help with the flood clean-up before he died.

Younus shared a home with two friends  Imran Ahfad and Atta Sharifi.

Ahfad said they had enjoyed travelling and seeing Australia. We travelled a lot, especially in the past year, to different cities, he said. We would spend time there with friends.

The housemate said Younus loved going to the gym and playing volleyball  he was a very energetic person.

Mirza Sharif, the public relations director at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia, said it had been difficult to arrange for Younuss parents to travel to Sydney for the funeral.

Theyre in quarantine at the moment and an exemption was given only after an intense negotiation, with the immigration department, for them to be released for only a very short period of time, he said. It was a minute-to-minute procedure.

The funeral for Younus was delayed due to a coronial inquiry and because of the complications in obtaining permission for his parents to attend.

178,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Inside Indonesia - Inside Indonesia,https://www.insideindonesia.org/samarinda-s-deadly-mining-pits,"Tessa Toumbourou

On 23 March 2016 two high school students – Noval Slamat Riyadi, aged 16, and Diki Aditya Pratama, aged 15 – were found drowned in an abandoned mining pit in Kutai Kartanegara, East Kalimantan. The teenagers’ deaths bring to 22 the number of children that have drowned in unused, water-filled mining holes in East Kalimantan since 2011. Only three months prior, a 13-year-old, Aprilia Wulandari, was found drowned in a soccer field-sized mine pit on the outskirts of Samarinda, the regional capital of East Kalimantan. Aprilia was reportedly playing with friends on her way home from school when she fell into the unmarked pit.



One hundred-and-fifty such pits scar Samarinda’s landscape, with an estimated 500 in total across East Kalimantan, according to the regional branch of the Network for Mining Advocacy (JATAM). JATAM recently released a confronting YouTube film with interviews of the families who have lost children to mining pits.



Decentralisation laws, particularly the 2009 Minerals and Coal Mining Law, gave district and municipal administrations the authority to issue mining permits. As a result, mining has exploded across Indonesia. In East Kalimantan alone, nearly 50 per cent of the province is now covered in coal mining permits, threatening agricultural land and conservation areas. New powers for allowing district governments to issue permits did not, however, correspond with an increase in budget or capacity for local management and monitoring of mining operations or clean-up activities. The results are devastating.

The costs of a poorly monitored mining industry

Decentralisation and the global mining boom brought chaos to the industry. In many places multiple permits have been issued for the same land area, permits have been allocated illegally in conservation and protected forests and along water catchment areas, and there has been a huge loss of state revenue – official estimates suggest that up to half of Indonesia’s mining companies pay no royalties and are not registered to pay tax. A recent investigation by Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission identified losses of almost US$1.24 billion in public revenue across Indonesia’s mining sector. Of a total of 10,827 mining permits issued across the country, 4563 were found to not meet ‘clean and clear’ standards, which include having a detailed environmental impact assessment and a post-mining reclamation and rehabilitation plan.



The proliferation of mining permits has had a damaging impact on people and the environment, particularly in Samarinda, where mining consumes 70 per cent of the municipality’s land area. Some mines are located within metres of homes and schools. While the industry brought employment and investment, it has also been the source of much angst –landslides and flooding worsened as a result of mining expansion in Samarinda according to JATAM’s research, with the World Wildlife Fund estimating the cost of the resulting damage at around $9 million.



Acids and sulphates from mining have leeched into rivers, contaminating local water catchment areas, fish ponds and wet rice fields according to local farmers in and around Samarinda who have experienced dramatic reductions in yields as a result.





Samarinda from the air - JATAM East Kalimantan

With the boom in coal exports now over, many small and medium-sized mines have closed or remain inactive. But they continue to pose a serious threat to residents. The blue-green colour of the water-filled mine pits lures young people to them, who then misjudge the depth of the pits and the steep sides that make them difficult to escape. Furthermore, Greenpeace researcher Cut Hilda Meutia found that the pits contained high levels of chemicals, including magnesium, iron, aluminium, cadmium and arsenic. As the impact of ingesting or absorbing these chemicals is not immediate, the negative effects accumulate over time.

The community’s right to a clean environment

Civil society organisations (CSOs) have worked hard to push local administrations to clean up abandoned sites. For years, CSOs have advocated for improved management of mining in East Kalimantan, home to 28 per cent of Indonesia’s coal reserves. In 2013, after 11 people had drowned in disused mining pits in East Kalimantan, CSOs decided to pursue legal avenues. A case was submitted to the Samarinda High Court on 25 June 2013, beginning a year-long trial known as the Gerakan Samarinda Menggugat (Samarinda Citizen Lawsuit, GSM). Nineteen plaintiffs impacted by coal mining presented at the trial, including rice farmers and fishermen who claimed that their diminishing water supplies were increasingly acidic due to dust particles released by mining operations.

On 16 July 2014, judges ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, finding that the government had been negligent in fulfilling their obligations under the 2009 Environmental Law, which states, ‘Everyone shall be entitled to a proper and healthy environment as part of their human rights’. By not fulfilling this requirement, the court decided, the local government had denied the people of Samarinda their right to enjoy a clean and safe environment. The court also ordered the government to evaluate all coal mining permits in Samarinda, monitor reclamation and other post-mining efforts, and take action to protect community farming and fishing areas from contamination by coal mining activities. Yet, since then little has improved, and children continue to drown in exposed coal mining pits in Samarinda and in the neighbouring district of Kutai Kartenegara.

Shifting authority and shifting blame

NGOs believe one of the reasons for the sluggish response could be the recent reforms that have shifted authority over mining permits. The Regional Governance Law (Law No. 23/2014) introduced in October 2014 moves authority for coal and mineral mining (as well as forestry and fisheries) from district governments to provincial governments and the central government. Following a transition period, which should be completed by 2 October 2016, provincial governments will be responsible for issuing permits, and also for evaluating the status of problematic mining permits in their jurisdictions. Governors must report the results to the central government, which will decide whether to maintain or cancel the permits.



Muhammad Muhdar, lawyer and researcher at Samarinda-based NGO Prakarsa Borneo, explains that post-mining clean-up and pit closure is the responsibility of companies. District governments – until the introduction of the new law – were tasked with enforcing and overseeing this process. Yet despite the real dangers of leaving mine sites exposed, companies often evade their reclamation responsibilities. Laws require that companies set aside funds for reclamation activities before conducting extraction work, but in practice these obligations are often not met. ‘There are many companies that do not put aside reclamation funds, so the government doesn’t have the resources it needs to close mine sites,’ says Muhdar.



Frustrated with government inaction and excuses, CSOs have tried to find creative responses to the problem. ‘The government always gives the excuse that there is not enough funding for closing mines’, says Merah Johansyah of East Kalimantan JATAM. NGO activists have held actions following children’s deaths in local mining pits, asking fellow Indonesians to donate Rp.1000 to crowd-fund mine closures. ‘When the funds are collected, we’ll give the money to the government. So they won’t have any further excuses for inaction.’





Protestors demand improvements to mining governance in Samarinda - JATAM national

Better late than never

East Kalimantan governor Awang Faroek Ishak has indicated his willingness to reform mining governance. Awang has a chequered past when it comes to the mining industry. During his time as district head of East Kutai, Awang was named by the Attorney General’s Office for embezzling state funds resulting from the sale of a portion of coal company PT Kaltim Prima Coal. But his recent attention to the industry’s problems is welcome, even if it comes late in the day.



In 2013 Awang issued a provincial moratorium on new concessions for mining, plantations and pulp and paper, which was restated in 2014. Awang has issued a statement saying that those companies on whose concessions mining-pit deaths have occurred must submit a mine closure plan and report on reparations paid to victims. Perhaps the most important reform has been the passing of a provincial regulation in 2015 enacting a supervisory commission. The commission will consist of government and civil society representatives tasked with overseeing mining reclamation and clean-up efforts, an important development that will introduce transparency and participation in the mining clean-up process, ensuring that pits are closed safely and in accordance with environmental standards.



An important step for improving mining governance in Indonesia will be ensuring that the shift in authority for mining permits from district to provincial governments does not slow down reforms. In the end it is the central government that should ensure there is no confusion over the division of responsibilities between the districts and the provinces.



President Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, was in East Kalimantan on 23 March 2016, when the bodies of teenagers Noval and Diki were found in mining pits. In response Jokowi has issued an audit of all mining permits issued in East Kalimantan. ‘I order the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to control and check mining [operations], especially small mining sites that don’t prioritise work safety,’ Jokowi told media in Balikpapan.



It seems momentum is finally gathering, and there is now an opportunity to tighten controls and mitigate further losses to human life, and to the ecosystems on which life is sustained. For this to happen, Jokowi needs to ensure that his demand for an audit of the mining sector results in real improvements in mining governance in East Kalimantan.

Egypt has invited Elon Musk to visit its famed pyramids after the SpaceX and Tesla founder posted a satirical tweet stating that clearly extra-terrestrials had built the giant monuments.

""Aliens built the pyramids obv,"" Musk had tweeted, picking up on a theme popular with conspiracy theorists and kicking off a predictable flood of replies ranging from light-hearted to furious.

Among the avalanche of one-liners, memes and potshots were some angry messages from nationalistic Egyptians who demanded the eccentric engineer and high-tech billionaire better check his facts.

Egyptian International Cooperation Minister Rania al-Mashat, a savvy social media user, however, saw a marketing opportunity to help revive the country's pandemic-battered tourism sector.

""I follow your work with a lot of admiration,"" wrote Mashat, a former tourism minister. ""I invite you & Space X to explore the writings about how the pyramids were built and also to check out the tombs of the pyramid builders.

""Mr. Musk, we are waiting for you,"" she added, inviting the entrepreneur to come and see for himself one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, Egypt's enormous tombs built for pharaohs and their consorts.

Musk followed up by posting a link to a BBC article about the history of the giant structures, calling it ""a sensible summary"" of how they were constructed.

The Giza Pyramids on the southwestern outskirts of the Egyptian capital Cairo

The most famous and largest of Egypt's ancient monuments, the Giza Pyramids outside Cairo, reopened to the public last month after a three-month closure forced by the coronavirus pandemic.

Egypt's tourism sector suffered a decade of turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring protests and overthrow of longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak, with militant attacks and political instability keeping many tourists away.

The tourism sector, which accounts for a fifth of the country's GDP and employs some three million people, had recovered to draw record visitors, around 13.6 million last year, when the COVID-19 crisis struck.

On 7 February, a flash flood triggered by a glacier burst in Chamoli killed a large number of people, besides demolishing a 13.2-mw hydel project in the Rishiganga, and caused extensive damage to the 520-mw Dhauliganga hydel project of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).

Here are the updates on the rescue and relief operations

31 of the 58 bodies identified: All 11 bodies retrieved from Tapovan tunnel till now have been identified, informed Deputy Inspector General of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) Ridhim Aggarwal on Tuesday.

""31 of 58 bodies recovered so far have been identified. All 11 bodies retrieved from Tapovan tunnel till now have been identified,"" Aggarwal told ANI.

""Teams of SDRF and NDRF along with dog squads are conducting searches in Raini village, Tapovan, and nearby areas,"" she added.

According to the Uttarakhand Police, 146 people are still missing.

NTPC starts disbursing compensation: State-run power giant NTPC on Tuesday said it has started disbursal of compensation to families of workers at its Tapovan project who lost their lives due to the flash flood in Uttarakhand earlier this month.

The first cheque of ₹20 lakh was handed over to Vimala Devi, wife of late Narendra Ji of Tapovan Vihar on February 15, a company statement said.

A team from NTPC, led by Tapovan project head R P Ahirwar, visited Vimala Devi at her house on Monday.

300 personnel join rescue operations: The rescue operation in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli district has been intensified with over 300 personnel joining the task to search 146 missing people.

""More than 325 personnel comprising engineers, officers, geologists, scientists, security personnel from National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Limited (THDC), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Uttarakhand Purvsanik Kalyan Limited (UPNL) and others are taking part in the rescue operation,"" ITBP said.

'Until last person is found': Uttarakhand director general of police Ashok Kumar has ongoing search and rescue operations will continue till the last missing person is found.

The muck clearing work inside the tunnel is likely to be completed in the nest few days.

Govt says 'will investigate all aspects of glacier burst': The Uttarakhand government will create a department to investigate the cause of the glacier burst that led to flash floods, state irrigation minister Satpal Maharaj has said.

""All angles (related to the Chamoli glacier burst) should be investigated. We will form a department in our ministry to monitor and study all the glaciers through satellite,"" said Maharaj.

45,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"AM4U in Rancho Cucamonga makes clothes without water, pollution - San Gabriel Valley Tribune",https://www.sgvtribune.com/2014/08/10/am4u-in-rancho-cucamonga-makes-clothes-without-water-pollution/,"RANCHO CUCAMONGA >> Bill Grier says the apparel industry is on the cusp of returning to Los Angeles and it is all due to a process he invented called infusion.

Bombarding polyester or nylon with photons releases tunnels of energy deep within the material that draw in the dye from an ink-jet design matched to the back of the fabric. Almost like magic, the material and the design merge and the shirt is ready for the cutter and the sewing machine.

No water. No chemicals. No pollution.

Grier, 67, said he has demonstrated his active-tunnel infusion process to Chinese investors. He has made swimwear, leggings and tops for American Apparel in Los Angeles. And he’s taking orders from apparel companies who want to build his factory as an add-on to their traditional business, or as a new line of on-demand clothing shops that can increase profits while shrinking one’s environmental footprint.

During a hot day in the Inland Empire, Grier invited the press to his prototype factory located in an industrial area of Rancho Cucamonga. The drought, entering a fourth straight year in California, was a topic of conversation. Normally, it takes 80 to 200 gallons of water to dye a shirt, he said. “A shirt like this,” he points to the black golf shirt he’s wearing, “takes 200 gallons of water and 73 cancer-causing chemicals. We use no chemicals and no water. All we use is the frequency of the fiber.”

The waterless, shirt-making process, a critical component of Grier’s AM4U company, received a key endorsement from Cal Poly Pomona’s Apparel Merchandising & Management Department. Peter Kilduff, department chair, showed up along with Los Angeles County Supervisor-Elect Hilda Solis for a tour of his Rancho Cucamonga test factory in July.

By eliminating many steps, Grier says his process can increase profits by as much as 400 percent. And it’s the right time for a sea change in apparel making.

“Smaller dye houses use a million gallons a day of water and they are suffering because of the water shortage. We’ve got to move on this enabling technology,” Grier said.

Solis, who soon will represent the First District which includes East L.A, Boyle Heights and downtown Los Angeles, sees active infusion as a way to create better-paying garment-worker jobs.

Grier starts his employees at $12 an hour with full benefits, he said. The infusion process cuts down on the number of steps used to make garments. He can make a shirt or a pair of jeans in 30 minutes under one roof because he doesn’t have to send out to dye the material, then send designs for assembling to shops in Pakistan or China, then wait for the final product to be shipped back to the United States. Also, since the process makes garments on-demand, it eliminates waste inherent in the clothing business.

“They dump about 30 percent into the landfill,” he said, adding that his process could usher in a new business model for the industry.

“Our process is much more efficient. It allows us to provide high paying jobs,” he said. It only takes 24 people to run each factory, from order, design to manufacturing, assembly and shipping.”

He sees a market both in the United States and overseas.

The potential for clean, non-polluting factories in China is strong, he said. In many industrial cities, waste water laced with chemicals from apparel factories pollute the country’s rivers and drinking water supply.

“They can take all that water they save and use it for agriculture,” he added.",2014-08-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['grier', 'cucamonga', 'angeles', 'process', 'am4u', 'apparel', 'makes', 'dye', 'shirt', 'factory', 'pollution', 'chemicals', 'water', 'rancho', 'clothes', 'los']",China,news article,English

Responding to the emergency appeal of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the Swiss emergency assistance will help the Vietnamese Red Cross to deliver assistance to and support the immediate and early recovery needs of 160000 people for 12 months. The main focus of this assistance will be to provide shelter, livelihoods and basic needs, health, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion.

Central provinces of Vietnam have been hammered by storms, heavy rains and floods since early October. Typhoon Molave (Storm No.9), which made landfall in Central Vietnam on 28 October 2020 is the ninth tropical storm to hit Vietnam this year. This was preceded by weeks of torrential rain and landslides that have disrupted the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 1,7 million people and killed more than 130. With another tropical storm named Goni (Storm No.10) making landfall on 6 November 2020 in South-Central Vietnam, the critical situation will likely be further aggravated.

The Swiss Embassy in Vietnam expresses its deepest condolences to the people of Vietnam for the loss of life and the destruction of property and crops as a result of the flooding in central Vietnam. We stand with the Government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones.

1255,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"In Pakistan, meltwater from glaciers is causing devastating flash floods, and the dwindling of ice-shields affects the entire nation - D+C Development and Cooperation",https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/pakistan-meltwater-glaciers-causing-devastating-flash-floods-and-dwindling-ice-shields,"Flash floods are becoming more common in the Hindu Kush Himalayas. Local communities are most at risk  but glacier melt also affects people who live far away from the mountains.

More than a century ago, a catastrophe struck Barikan Kot. This mountain village was flooded by a sudden outburst of water from the Hinarchi glacier. The reason was the bursting of an ice wall which had held back a lake of meltwater that had formed on the glacier. About 100 families lost their homes and livelihoods as rocks, earth and debris were swept over the village and its orchards and fertile land.

In the past, this kind of flash flood occurred rarely. That has changed. The Bagrote valley in the Karakoram mountain range in northern Pakistan now suffers several of them every year. Global warming is affecting glaciers all over the world, and the Hindu Kush Himalaya is no exception. Especially in the summer months, melting ice leads to new glacial lakes which, in turn, can cause flash floods.

Aisha Khan of the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change (CSCCC)  a private organisation working on climate change  warns that glacial lake-outburst floods are becoming ever more likely. The impacts are catastrophic, she points out. In recent years, several dozens of people have been killed, and many more families have lost their livelihoods. The local communities tend to be disadvantaged and poor. According to Aisha Khan, the challenge is to tell them in simple language why the environment is changing and what they can do to adapt.

The civil-society activist insists that women in particular must be prepared to respond appropriately. They have a crucial role to play in evacuation, first aid and rescue and relief operations, Aisha Khan says. She wants all risk-management measures to reflect both the social conditions in the village and the scientific insights.

Syed Zahid Hussain Shah agrees that the risks are increasing and must be controlled. He was the field manager of a project run by the government of Pakistan and the Pakistan office of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) that served this purpose from 2011 to 2016. He reports that the Hinarchi glacier is only 16 kilometres long today. It was about 12 % longer 30 years ago, and its ice-shield was higher too.

Pakistan has more than 7,000 glaciers. According to an estimate, there are more than 3,000 glacial lakes, of which 36 are dangerous. Some 7 million people are exposed to the risk of glacial lake-outburst floods, which typically occur in July and August, the warmest months.

The project Zahid worked for took several risk-mitigating initiatives in Bagrote valley. A bridge and protective walls were built. Moreover, streams were excavated and made deeper, so they can carry more water. The project set up four digitised weather stations that automatically relay information pertaining to possible glacial lake outbursts. Thanks to them, it has become possible to warn local communities early on.

The weather stations have helped to save many lives. Hussain Ali, who lives in a mountain village, appreciates them: Early warning allows people to shift to safer places. Nonetheless, he says that flash floods have killed more than 20 people in his area in recent years. Moreover, such extreme weather events have killed livestock and destroyed orchards and fields. Several dozen households were therefore forced to move from the mountain villages down into the valley, where it is easier, but nonetheless still quite difficult to eke out a living for people who have lost all assets.

The government of Pakistan and UNDP are now running a follow-up project in the region. It is called the Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) project. GLOF stands for glacial lake-outburst flood. The budget for the years 2017 to 2021 is $ 37 million. The project will cover 15 districts and benefit approximately 29 million people.

The mountain regions of Pakistans neighbouring countries Afghanistan, India and China face the same kind of risk for the same reasons. Irfan Tariq, a former director general of Pakistans Ministry of Climate Change, points out that the entire Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range is a very sensitive ecological system. It is very difficult to control or limit the impacts of climate change on glaciers, he says, so Pakistans government is closely monitoring the glaciers.



The big picture

The melting of the glaciers has impacts far beyond the mountain ranges. Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas feed Asias most important rivers, including the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong and the Yangtse. Hundreds of millions of people depend on these waters. Indeed, Asian civilisations have benefited from the glaciers stabilising water supply throughout the seasons for millennia (see Sheila Mysorekar in the Monitor section of D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2017/09). As the glaciers dwindle, human-built infrastructure will have to serve the functions the glaciers performed naturally in the past.

In this context, dams matter very much. Related infrastructure is vulnerable to glacial lake-outburst floods however. Should a major glacial lake outburst cause a veritable mountain tsunami, the damage may be serious. Syed Mehr Ali Shah from Pakistans Ministry of Water Resources says: We are very much concerned with the bigger glacial lake-outburst flood events, with regards to the safety of our existing hydraulic infrastructures, which include Tarbela dam. This dam is more than 140 metres high and serves the purposes of hydropower, irrigation and flood control.

There are several major dams in northern Pakistan, and a new one is currently being built. The wall of Diamer Bhasha dam will be more than 250 metres high. The safety of these structures is very important, says Mehr: We need to protect them from any kind of dam-break phenomenon. The officer expresses his confidence in the structures being strong enough to withstand typical glacial lake-outburst floods. He says the Diamer Bhasha reservoir has been designed to bear any dam-break wave that occurs due to such flood. At the same time, spillways ensure that excess water can be channelled away.

But even if dams can be built to withstand flash floods, mega dams cause environmental problems in their own right. Experts warn, moreover, that ever more sophisticated and expensive infrastructure will be needed to adapt societies to global warning. If environmental change spins out of control, adaptation will prove impossible for ever more people.

Ultimately, there is no alternative to mitigating climate change. Pakistan, however, only emits about one ton of carbon per head and year, according to Climate Analytics, an independent monitoring initiative. This comparatively small figure means that other countries which emit far more must assume responsibility and assist countries like Pakistan to build their resilience to climate change.

740,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Rural women tackle drought-affected Mozambique's rise in child marriage - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/rural-women-tackle-drought-affected-mozambique-s-rise-child-marriage,"More than 2 million people across Mozambique, especially in the southern and central regions, have been affected by severe drought since 2015. The prolonged crisis has exhausted household food stock, disrupted lives and livelihood. For Mozambican women and girls, who are primarily responsible for managing food and water for their families, the drought has also meant increased work burden and earlier marriages, leading to lost childhood, education and opportunities.

“My wish is to be able to influence other girls so that they don’t drop out of school,” shared Guelsa Chivodze, who was married off at 17 years of age. For years, she took care of the household and endured physical and financial abuse.

“My husband refused to allow me to go to night school because he thought I would meet boyfriends there... After all that I have gone through in my life, I took it upon myself to become an activist in my community and raise awareness of other girls about the need to go to school and defend themselves against child marriage and gender-based violence,” adds Chivodze.

For Chivodze, the chance for a new beginning came after her husband was convicted of criminal offences. Today, at 30 years of age, she has gone back to school. She studies at the Guiljá Secondary School in the Chinhacanine village in Gaza, a southern province of Mozambique, where UN Women has supported efforts that mobilized students, teachers and parents’ associations to end violence against women and girls. She aspires to become a nurse, and help survivors of gender-based violence.

Chivodze’s older brother, Helónio Chivoze, is her hero. He provides financial support for Chivodze and her two boys, and encourages her to complete her education and become self-reliant. “My dream is to have Guelsa become a professional, and stop looking for marriage to sustain her family,” he says. But the drought is making it difficult to meet all the expenses: “I used to farm 2015 cattle before. But since the drought, I am left with only 37 cattle and I lost 12 hectares of crop,” he says.

In a context where early and forced marriages were already prevalent, The prolonged drought and the accompanying economic hardships have led to more parents marrying off their girls early because there would be one less mouth to feed. In Mozambique, 48 per cent of girls are married before age 18 and 14 per cent are married before age 15.

Glória Mabunda’s life was similarly impacted. A survivor of violence from Chinhacainine village, Guijá District, Gaza Province, Mozambique (southern region of Mozambique), she was forced to leave school in grade seven because she was pregnant.

“In my community, men seldom let their women go to school for fear of women’s empowerment and change in the power relations,” said Mabunda, who now empowers girls and young women in her community.

“When they marry a young woman, it is a lifetime of deprivation and abject poverty [for the girl/woman] from the very onset of marriage. Physical and financial violence is the following stage,” she added.

“It is essential that we understand the relationships between the effects of climate change and the persistence of violence against women, including through harmful socio-cultural practices such as child marriage. Integrating these gender issues in our disaster and humanitarian response is about doing our job right,” stressed Ondina da Barca Vieira, UN Women Programme Specialist in Mozambique.

Mabunda and Chivodze are among the lucky few who got a second chance at education and opportunities, after early marriages.

At age 34, Mabunda finally divorced her husband because he wouldn’t allow her to complete her studies. She took over her mother’s poultry farm in 2016, after attending a UN Women-supported training delivered by the Mozambican Institute for Agrarian Research, which taught poultry farming management techniques to rural women. “I want to grow my poultry farming business, be a role model and help other young women and girls in my community empower themselves,” she says.

In 2014, with support from the Government of Belgium, UN Women implemented the project, “Expanding Women’s Role in Agricultural Production and Natural Resource Management,” to combat climate change and improve food security in Mozambique. The project empowered rural women, as well as men, but by providing training and agricultural benefits to women, it challenged the pervasive gender stereotypes that denied women equal opportunities.

As Inês Zitha, a community animal health worker based in Djavanhane, in the district of Guijá, Gaza, explains, women were not expected to work with cattle; it was perceived as a man’s job. In a region where livestock is one of the most valuable assets, it’s an important job.

“They said that women should not get into cattle stables… if a woman entered a stable during her menstrual cycle, it would reduce the livestock’s productivity. After attending the trainings and awareness sessions supported by UN Women, I realized that it was a power relations issue,” says Zitha.

With the revenue from her business, Zitha can now pay for her daughter to attend school, and has started building her own house to replace the one destroyed by a cyclone. She is among 200 rural women from the southern province of Gaza, who directly benefited from the project.

In the course of three years, the project has resulted in more women securing land tenure rights, civil registration and licenses for their businesses. As empowered, economically resilient women, they are setting better examples for girls and women in their communities and showing that early marriage is not the only way out.",2017-11-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['child', 'mozambique', 'rise', 'school', 'southern', 'age', 'mozambiques', 'drought', 'rural', 'droughtaffected', 'girls', 'women', 'marriage', 'gaza', 'tackle', 'violence']",Mozambique,news article,English
692,Drought Sri Lanka,Fluctuating ginger price may stabilise by harvest time - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fluctuating-ginger-price-may-stabilise-by-harvest-time/article4763564.ece,"The price of ginger, which is presently very high owing to shortfall in production, is expected to firm up around Rs. 4,000 a quintal by the harvest season, according to a price-forecast study.

To help farmers decide whether to opt for ginger cultivation this season or not, the Market Intelligence Cell of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, took up an early survey of traders and collected the modal prices of ginger in Bangalore market in the last 11 years besides conducting an econometric analysis to forecast the price of ginger when the crop comes up for harvesting in November-December.

The survey indicates that the kharif season ginger may fetch a modal price of about Rs. 4,000 a quintal during the harvest season against the present price which is fluctuating upwards of Rs. 11,000 a quintal.

C.P. Gracy, who headed a three-member price research team that included Jyoti Naik and Nagashree N., told The Hindu that the normal price of ginger was around Rs. 2,000 a quintal before the price fluctuation.

“The present price level is only temporary and mainly due to the high demand triggered by shortfall in production,” she said while indicating that it may not be appropriate to consider the present range of price for any comparison with future price.

60 p.c. fall

Wayanad and surrounding areas in Kerala, which account for the highest ginger production in the country, reported nearly 60 per cent fall in production in 2012-13, the survey notes.

In Karnataka, ginger is grown in about 29,000 hectares, spread over mainly in Hassan, Kodagu, Shimoga, Chickmagalur, Bidar and Mysore districts. It is cultivated both as the main crop as well as an intercrop in plantations.

India is the largest producer of ginger in the world, with an estimated production of 7,56,000 tonnes in 2012-13 against the global production of about 1.6 million tonnes. About 1,55,000 hectares of land is under ginger cultivation in India with an average productivity of 1,514 kg per hectare.

India accounts for about 21 per cent of the global share of ginger production, followed by China (20.5 per cent), Indonesia (12.7 per cent), Nepal (11.5 per cent) and Thailand (10 per cent). India is also the largest exporter of ginger. India exported about 35,616.4 tonnes of ginger to the United States, the UAE, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Morocco, the United Kingdom, Nepal, Spain, Egypt and other countries during 2011-12.

In India, ginger is cultivated mainly in Kerala, Odisha, Karnataka, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim.",2013-05-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['rs', 'india', 'tonnes', 'cent', 'quintal', 'survey', 'production', 'fluctuating', 'price', 'season', 'stabilise', 'ginger', 'harvest']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
