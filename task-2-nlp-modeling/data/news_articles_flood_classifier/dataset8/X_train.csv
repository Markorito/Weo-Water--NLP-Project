Deaths have been recorded across 13 provinces, with the highest casualties in Fars, Lorestan, Golestan and Hamedan, state-run IRNA quotes the head of Iran's Coroner's Office, Ahmad Shojaei, as saying.

""Over 140 rivers have burst their banks and some 409 landslides have been reported in the country, it reported , adding that 78 roads had been blocked and 84 bridges in flood-stricken areas affected.

Officials on Saturday warned residents in the province of Khuzestan of rising water levels and urged them to take evacuation notices seriously, IRNA reported.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent said it was helping thousands of people affected by the flooding.

""Red Crescent volunteers and staff have evacuated hundreds of people to safety, and have distributed food and items such as tents, blankets and health kits to tens of thousands of people,"" the organization's Middle East and North Africa director, Sayed Hashem, said.

Iran accuses US of hindering aid

On April 2, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement extending condolences to the victims of the flooding in Iran and blaming its government for the disaster.

""The United States stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief.""

""It seems the US Secretary of State is unaware of the mismanagement of natural disasters in the US over the past two years, and hence opines -- in an unprofessional, interventionist and demagogic manner -- on Iran's management of the horrific and unprecedented floods which simultaneously afflicted 24 provinces,"" Zarif said, before referencing Hurricanes Harvey, Michael and Florence and Maria.",2019-04-07 00:00:00+00:00,"['secretary', 'flooding', 'crescent', 'kills', 'regime', '70', 'red', 'thousands', 'rainfalls', 'iran', 'village', 'state', 'reported', 'mismanagement', 'staterun', 'record']",Iran,news article,English
892,FL-2020-000164-IND,"Kharif sowing doubles, thanks to above-normal pre-monsoon rains in central India - ThePrint",https://theprint.in/india/kharif-sowing-doubles-thanks-to-above-normal-pre-monsoon-rains-in-central-india/452730/,"Text Size: A- A+

New Delhi: Thanks to above-normal pre-monsoon rainfall in June in many states, the sowing of kharif crops across the country has more than doubled over last year.

According to estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture, the area sown this year is 315.63 lakh hectares (lha), up 104.25 per cent from last year’s 154.53 lha, because more water-intensive crops like cotton and soybean are being sown this time.

According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the country has received 22 per cent more rainfall than normal between 1 and 26 June — 165.1 mm against 135.66 mm in the corresponding period last year. Rainfall in central India, including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, was 44 per cent higher than last year.

This has resulted in reservoir storage across the country on 25 June standing at 56.72 billion cubic metres (BCM), against 29.16 BCM last year, while in central India, the corresponding figures are 17.21 BCM and 9.10 BCM respectively.

Water-intensive crops

According to Water Productivity Mapping of Major Indian Crops by NABARD, the five crops grown in India that require the most water are cotton, rice, soybean, sugarcane and wheat. Cotton in India uses the most water — 22,500 litres to produce 1 kg — with the drier regions of Gujarat and Maharashtra being its leading producers. Soybean requires 900 litres of water for 1 kg produce, and is grown primarily in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

This year, MP received 162.3 mm of rainfall between 1 and 24 June, more than double the normal 77.3 mm, while Maharashtra received 220.4 mm compared to the usual 147.3 mm over the corresponding period. In Gujarat’s case, the corresponding figures were 106.6 mm and 71.7 mm respectively.

This has resulted in MP’s acreage for soybean increasing to 40.28 lha from nil last year, while in Maharashtra, it has shot up to 18.7 lha from last year’s 0.001 lha.

Cotton sowing has also spiked in Maharashtra to 23.772 lha as on 25 June this year from last year’s 0.194 lha, while in Gujarat, the figures are 11.67 lha this year and 5 lha last year.

Other water-intensive crops like paddy and sugarcane have also seen growth — paddy rising to 37.71 lha from 27.93 lha last year, and sugarcane inching up to 49.69 lha from 49.09 lha.

The sowing of pulses is also up to 19.40 from 6.03 lha, with arhar being grown on 9.87 lha (1.83 in 2019), urad on 2.75 lha (90,000 lha in 2019) and moong on 5.30 lha (last year 2.06 lha) of land.

Experts cautious

Bhagwan Meena, the MP-based convener of farmer body Kisan Swaraj Sangathan, told ThePrint: “The rainfall here is more than anything we have witnessed in the last 10 years. Monsoon has arrived 8 days before normal.”

However, Meena added that the rainfall has also caused a series of problems.

“Many farmers have lost their crops due to waterlogging for days in their field. My 20-acre field is still not ready to sow soybean as there has been continuous rain for the last four days in my area,” he said.

Meanwhile, Arabinda K. Padhee, country director of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, advised caution.

“The sowing of crops, especially the water-intensive ones, might increase with the early rainfall, but the yield and productivity of these crops are really dependent on the rains in July. There is a need to be really careful with the increasing sowing of these crops as both cotton and soybean are commercial crops and their prices depend on the market status, which is really unpredictable these days,” Padhee told ThePrint.

He added: “The sowing of coarse cereals and millets like ragi and jowar should be promoted owing to its nutritional value. The support price of these crops should be raised, as compared to other crops.”

Australia, Switzerland and Thailand have offered aid to victims of multiple storms and floods in central Vietnam last month.

The Australian embassy in Hanoi said on Friday its government will provide an additional AUD2 million ($1.45 million) to help Vietnam respond to the impacts of prolonged floods and landslides in the central region. The country had earlier provided AUD100,000 ($71,300).

The aid money will be used to meet urgent needs like providing clean water and sanitation and hygiene and dignity kits to affected people, and support the restoration of clean water supply to schools.

The Swiss embassy also announced grant of urgent aid worth CHF300,000 ($333,000) to help address the immediate needs of 160,000 people focusing on housing, livelihoods, healthcare, water, and hygiene.

In a phone call to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-o-cha, offered $30,000 toward relief efforts.

The central region was repeatedly hit by torrential rains, widespread flooding and landslides triggered by four storms in October.

So far 235 people have been killed or are missing, almost 390,000 houses were flooded and more than 300,000 families have been evacuated, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority.

Many people have lost almost all their household possessions or had their homes, food stocks, livestock, and crops badly damaged.

Special to Ventura County Star

In the ancient world, one of the many ways kings taxed their subjects was based on the harvest of their subjects’ trees. According to a website sponsored by Ithaka, which describes itself as “a not-for-profit organization helping the academic community…”, sometimes these taxes were comically complicated.

For example, since likely crop yields in ancient Egypt depended on annual flooding of the Nile River, taxes required three tax collectors and two assessment periods. Before the floods, officials calculated taxes based on predicted flood heights.

After each flood, three assessors refined the tax by holding cords, stretching the cords, and recording by the number of cord lengths the extent of cropland watered. These experts then calculated as a tax 10% of the expected harvest.

Eco-tip:Toilet maintenance important for flow to avoid replacement

Ancient commentary on biblical injunctions shows similar procedures elsewhere. The Jewish holiday of Tu BiShvat, linked to the lunar calendar but celebrated this year on Thursday, commemorates the “birthday” of the trees, a demarcation enacted partly for an ancient tax.

Each tree, regardless of when it was planted, was counted as a year older on this date. The “tree year” was initially for Levitical prohibitions on fruit from the first three years, but later used because each year, or partial year, of the tree’s harvest, 10% of crop yield from each tree was owed to the Temple in Jerusalem for distribution to the priestly class and the poor.

Today, many Jews celebrate the birthday of the trees by planting trees. Although figs, dates and pomegranates are the traditional tree crops of the holiday, I will plant a persimmon tree this Thursday.

Bare root tree planting is generally best at this time of year, and in the bare root stage, planting is easier. As noted by University of California Farm Adviser Ben Faber, “In the bare root stage, trees are still dormant, and you don’t need to be as delicate with them” as you would with evergreens, which typically suffer transplant shock.

Although taxes no longer extract 10% of our harvest for a pharaoh, king or priestly class, and tithing to the hungry through organizations such as Food Forward or Food Share is voluntary, endemic to Ventura County are several other entities likely to extract a share of our crops.

Gophers are prevalent, so one measure to protect your new tree is to protect roots with a mesh gopher barrier. I have dug holes deeper than needed for the root ball, lined the bottom of the hole with chicken wire shaped into a basket, and filled the basket partially with dirt before planting the tree at the desired depth.

Read More:Eco-tip: Native plants for their own sake, Growing Works for others

However, Faber warns, “You really need to line up the bottom of the tree ball with the bottom of the hole” because “if you dig it much deeper, the tree settles over time” and if the trunk stem is covered, the tree becomes vulnerable to disease.

Instead, Faber recommends products such as the Root Guard Speed Basket, which fits into the planting hole, preventing gopher attack.

Moles are also eager to extract a portion of your crop. They are not really eating roots, but digging for worms, disturbing the root system. Both moles and gophers can be killed with spear or harpoon style traps, which are better than anticoagulant poison bait traps because the poison may harm non-targeted species, including predators eating poisoned animals.

Ground squirrels eat roots, strip bark, and also take fruits and nuts from trees. You can stop squirrels with metal guards around tree trunks. Some gardeners place poison gas devices inside burrows.

Birds also try to take a share of crops. Screening or netting material tied around the tree is most effective. Sometimes, owl statues, fake snakes or cat statues can scare away birds, but only if these are repositioned frequently.

Tax authorities of the ancient world no longer take a portion of your garden, so non-toxic methods of pest control can help you enjoy the full wealth of your harvest.

943,FL-2021-000021-IND,Fact Check: Avalanche Video From Nepal Goes Viral As Glacier Burst In Uttarakhand - The Logical Indian,https://thelogicalindian.com/fact-check/video-from-nepal-shared-with-false-claims-about-uttarakhands-glacier-burst-26764,"On Sunday (7th February 2020), the Tapovan-Reni area in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district witnessed a huge glacier break which led to massive flooding in Dhauli Ganga and Alaknanda Rivers. Several houses were destroyed and the death toll rose to nearly 31 with over 150 people still missing.

A video is making rounds on social media claiming to show the recently occurred glacier break in Uttarakhand. The 30 seconds long video shows a massive mass of snow falling down a mountain.



It is being shared on Facebook with a caption in Hindi, ""First video of glacier breaking in Chamoli, Uttarakhand which happened this morning.""

The post has been archived here.

The same video was uploaded on YouTube claiming to show glacier break in Uttarakhand.



Claim:

This video shows the glacier burst that happened on February 7, 2021, in Uttarakhand, India.

Fact Check:

By breaking the video from the post into several keyframes and doing a reverse image search, we found out that the video was recorded in Nepal in early January 2021.

The longer version of the same video was uploaded on YouTube on January 12, 2021. The video was titled, ""Massive avalanche at Kapuche Glacier Lake, Nepal.""

Here is the comparison between the video from the viral post and the video uploaded prior to the Uttarakhand tragedy. The location is identified to be the same and confirms the location to be Nepal.

The first image (top) shows the screenshot of the viral video and the bottom one is from the video mentioning Nepal uploaded on January 12.

The original video was uploaded by a user named @naren32 on Instagram in January 2021 which received a lot of attention. Later, the same account posted an over 3-minute long video of the avalanche with a caption that says, ""Huge Avalanche at Kapuche Lake. Here comes a full video of a huge avalanche, had to spend overnight at Kapuche lake (Lowest altitude glacier lake in the world) in order to catch this moment and it eventually paid off.""

The same video was also uploaded on Facebook by an account named Natural Beauty of Nepal on January 13, 2021.



On searching with a few relevant keywords, a news report published on January 16, 2021, also comes up where the same video has been mentioned. The report says, ""Tourists vacationing in the mountains of Nepal filmed a powerful avalanche that hit them, and caused admiration on the network. The group spent the night near Lake Capuche and the next morning captured an unusual phenomenon. The recording shows how a huge avalanche gradually descends from the mountains, raising clouds of snow into the air, and then crashing onto the reservoir.""



Hence, a video of an avalanche from Nepal was circulated with false claims of it being recent and from Uttarakhand.

693,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,The Red Cross helps with climate change preparedness - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/red-cross-helps-climate-change-preparedness,"Extreme weather phenomena and natural disasters are increasing with the rise in global temperatures. These disasters cause the most suffering to the poorest people in the world, who also have the least influence on climate change.

The Red Cross prioritises those who are most vulnerable in its climate change work as well.

The following six examples help illustrate how Red Cross volunteers are helping people and communities prepare for and survive the impacts of climate change and sudden natural disasters in different parts of the world.

1. Drought relief

Climate change is making dry periods more frequent and disrupting annual rains in many areas, thus exposing people, particularly children, to malnourishment. In response, the Finnish Red Cross is helping supply people with clean water in drought-ravaged southern Africa.

In Muzarabani, Zimbabwe, water used to be extremely difficult to come by. Before the construction of a well and water pipeline, the local health station had to administer medication and deliver children without water.

In local schools, children were fainting from dehydration and afflicted with diarrhoea and infections. Running, clean water is a small miracle that is talked about with pride in the area. Now clean water is available at the turn of a tap from two water supply points, which the Finnish Red Cross constructed with funding from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

2. Aid in the midst of a cyclone

Tropical cyclones destroy buildings and infrastructure with increasing force. According to the IFRC Climate Centre, the destructive force of Cyclone Idai, which struck Mozambique in March, was most likely increased by climate change.

Climate change has resulted in a rise in the area’s sea level, and the port city of Beira, which was caught in the middle of the cyclone, is located on low-lying ground. The majority of the destroyed homes were dwellings constructed in low-lying areas.

Intensifying heavy rains are causing increasingly severe flooding and ruining cultivated areas. Contaminated floodwater is also effective at spreading diseases.

After a disaster, people need quick access to clean water and working toilets to prevent the spread of diseases such as cholera. Flood waters also provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which spread malaria and other diseases.

Following the cyclone, the International Red Cross deployed emergency response units to Mozambique, which supply water for up to 15,000 and sanitation for up to 20,000 people per day.

With support from donors and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Finnish Red Cross sent a cholera unit and hospital supplies to Mozambique in cooperation with the Canadian Red Cross.

3. The changing climate also impacts health

Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year due to malnourishment, malaria, diarrhoea and hot weather, for example.

Improving the health of those who are most vulnerable is at the very core of the Finnish Red Cross’s development cooperation.

Drought and poverty are making life more difficult in many countries, such as Somalia. With the support of the EU, the Finnish Red Cross offered cash donations to 1,500 families with malnourished children in the country.

In addition to this, health care services were provided to 28,927 people, of whom 16,438 were children. Thanks to the support, 92 per cent of children received three meals a day and 98 per cent of acute cases of malnourishment were successfully treated.

4. Forecast-based financing under development

Developing early preparedness helps avoid human suffering when disaster strikes. In Zimbabwe, the Finnish Red Cross is piloting forecast-based financing, which the Red Cross movement is among the first to develop.

The hope is that new working methods will improve the efficiency of disaster risk management and help make related efforts more localised.

Forecast-based financing is also being developed in the Philippines, where the Finnish Red Cross has been conducting community-based disaster preparedness work in the slums of Manila and the countryside since 2013 and helped communities recover from the damage caused by storms.

5. Support for the elderly suffering from hot weather

The impacts of climate change are also being felt in Finland, where winter storms and summer heat waves are threatening the older population in particular.

Warmer summers increase the risk of premature death, especially among the elderly. According to the National Institute for Health and Welfare, the summer 2018 heat wave caused 380 “additional” deaths in Finland. During summer 2018, Red Cross volunteers supported the home care of the elderly in Sotkamo.

Winter storms are also predicted to become increasingly fierce. The Finnish Red Cross helped people and supported the authorities during blackouts caused by crown snow in Kainuu in 2018. People over the age of 75 were visited by volunteers, in addition to which the Red Cross’s logistics supplied the area with generators, water canisters and accommodation supplies.

6. Climate change can cause conflicts

Research shows that climate change can escalate or serve as one of the initial causes of conflicts and migration movements. The Red Cross’s basic work includes responding to the humanitarian consequences of both phenomena and people’s needs.

The range of impacts can be wide. When people flee from conflicts or disasters escalated by climate change, hot weather can prove fatal for the people forced out of their homes, for example. In these situations the Red Cross helps people at refugee camps.

Preparing for climate change and repairing the damage that it causes will require additional resources in the coming years.",2019-06-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'change', 'children', 'climate', 'support', 'health', 'helps', 'cross', 'impacts', 'finnish', 'red', 'preparedness', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
743,FL-2016-000114-EGY,EGYPT: Government to launch more water-efficient irrigation system - AFRIK 21,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/egypt-government-to-launch-more-water-efficient-irrigation-system/,"The Egyptian government is continuing its policy of rationalising water consumption. It will simply replace the irrigation system currently in place. The Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture will soon launch a new “modern” irrigation system.

This is a change of method recommended by the experts. It involves replacing flood irrigation practises, such as runoff, used to grow cereals such as rice. Instead, the government advocates drip, bubble irrigation and mist spraying.

These new systems should enable Egyptian farmers to work without depleting water resources. For several months, the Egyptian government has been engaged in a plan to rationalise water consumption. The decrease in the flow of the Nile River is partly responsible for this new policy. According to the government, the amount of rainwater entering the Nile from Ethiopian mountain ranges is below seasonal standards.

As a result, the flow of the Nile will decrease by 5 billion m3. “This deficit represents 10% of Egypt’s share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic metres of water, as established in a 1959 agreement allocating Nile water rights,” the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources recently stated. In response to this situation, in August 2019, the Egyptian government decided to amend Law 53/1966 on agriculture. Restrictions are now imposed on the cultivation of rice, sugar cane, bananas and all crops with a high water content.

Other alternatives

After having long played the role of the first source of surface water in Egypt, the Nile is no longer able to supply the entire country of the Pharaohs. The current government is relying on new water supply resources, including seawater desalination. A few days ago, the government announced that it had received an offer from an Emirian company for an investment of $800 million to build several desalination plants. They will produce 500,000 m³ of water per day. A committee has been formed at the Ministry of Housing to study in detail this major offer.

The company, whose name has not been revealed, wants to take advantage of the opening of desalination to private companies. The Egyptian government’s goal is to commission 21 new desalination plants by the end of 2022. Currently, 19 factories with a capacity of 400,000 m3 per day are under construction in the coastal governorates. These facilities will be in addition to the 63 desalination plants located in the governorates of North Sinai, Matrouh, the Red Sea and South Sinai.

Conservationists have worked around the clock for more than a year to save them. Now, the last two, a mother and calf, are the final pair to be rescued from the island.

The rescuers constructed a special steel barge â?? â??The GiRaftâ? â?? in order to carry the giraffes to safety a mile away. Now, with the transfer of the calf named Noelle and her mother Ngarikoni, all the animals are safe.

The giraffes have been moved to a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland.

David Oâ??Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, which works on over 20 giraffe conservation projects in nine African countries, said: â??We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue.

â??With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.â?

Park rangers had to lure the animals onto the barge using food they were fed on the island, including pellets, acacia leaves, seed pods and mangos.

Each time a giraffe joined the barge, it was sealed, and they were driven to the 4,400-acre fenced sanctuary within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

The towermates (as groups of giraffe are called) are together again and safely exploring the Ruko Conservancy, where they have plenty of food and securty.

Approval to move the giraffes was needed from Kenya Wildlife Service. The first giraffe, named Asiwa, was moved in December without incident.

Rothschildâ??s (Nubian) giraffe are a dwindling subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and Uganda. Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya.

631,Drought Sri Lanka,World Diabetes Day: The effect on older people in Africa - HelpAge International,https://www.helpage.org/blogs/gacheru-maina-20/world-diabetes-day-the-effect-on-older-people-in-africa-484/,"Quick link to further information

World Diabetes Day: The effect on older people in Africa

14 November is World Diabetes Day, a disease which according to the World Health Organization (WHO), affects more than 180 million people worldwide. WHO also estimates that the prevalence of diabetes in Africa varies between one and 20%. The global spread of diabetes has given it all the characteristics of a pandemic.

WHO projects that the number of people with diabetes is likely to more than double by 2030. In 2005, an estimated 1.1 million people died from diabetes, almost 80% of them occurring in low and middle-income countries. Diabetes is no longer a disease of affluent countries; it is affecting people all over the world.

Global health problem

Diabetes is particularly serious due to its complications: cardiovascular ailments, cerebral vascular accidents, renal insufficiency, blindness, sexual impotence and gangrene of the feet which can lead to amputation. Diabetes and associated chronic conditions are rapidly emerging as major and global health problems.

Research also shows that diabetes affects older people disproportionately. For example, in developing countries, the majority of those with the disease are aged between 45 and 64.

My parents are both diabetic. Most of their friends and relatives the same age have diabetes. I have watched relatives succumb to diabetes-related complications. The increase in the number of cases of people living with diabetes in Africa is truly shocking.

In fact, I almost expect most of the older people I meet to be diabetic and am often surprised when I find out they are not! In the past, it was rare to find older people suffering from diabetes. My paternal grandparents are the only people I knew of their age at the time who were diabetic.

The costs of diabetes

Due to the hereditary factor, I expect that I will become diabetic. This scares me tremendously. I have watched my parents work their day-to-day schedules around doctors' appointments, buying expensive medication and visiting their friends who are ill and even attending funerals. The financial costs of living with diabetes is daunting, especially in Africa where older people do not have a steady income and medical insurance.

My parents are the luckier ones. In fact, they and most of their friends are lucky to have some income and family support during their illness. I dread to think of older people, the urban and rural poor, who cannot afford the medication, who do not have money to visit medical facilities and who die because they did not know enough about their condition or were not even diagnosed.

I need to work hard to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. That is the challenge that younger people and governments need to embrace. While diabetes may not be reversed, it can be contained. The need to focus on non-communicable diseases is now, more than ever before, important for the African continent. The cost of illnesses such as diabetes is high. Just ask my parents.

992,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Can Myanmar's Protesters Win? – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/can-myanmars-protesters-win/,"They are up against a ruthless, entrenched military. But history tells us not to underestimate the power of the people.

Nobody – least of all the Tatmadaw, Myanmar’s military – could have imagined that the February coup in Myanmar would trigger such a flood of outrage, mass civil disobedience, and the forging of a multi-ethnic alliance across the nation.

Most Myanmar experts from the region’s plethora of think tanks would have scoffed at the suggestion that even two months after the coup, Myanmar’s military would not have been able to crush the revolt.

The heady days of the protest are best described by long-time analyst and ex-political prisoner Dr. Khin Zaw Win, writing for openDemocracy: “The protests are marked by their size as well as diversity. It is truly amazing to witness people from different ethnicities, faiths, and occupations from everywhere in Myanmar coming together in a single purpose – to bring down the dictatorship.”

Khin Zaw Win, the director of the Tampadipa Institute in Yangon, also observed that even the much-persecuted Rohingya are included in the movement: “Long-suppressed voices like those of the Rohingya and Muslims are now being seen and heard prominently, and women are participating in strength.”

The regime has unquestionably been weakened by the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) that mushroomed all over the country after the coup. The nationwide non-compliance has throttled almost all sectors, from government administration to banks and the rest of the economy.

The military has responded with force. A brutal crackdown has turned parts of Yangon and Mandalay into war zones in the last two weeks. The civilian death toll of both protesters and hapless bystanders has surpassed 536, with 2,600 people detained.

A Myanmar specialist at Chiang Mai University, Dr. Ashley South, told The Diplomat that, despite the repression, “It is impossible for the junta to normalize this coup. Schools have closed down. It is amazing the only functioning schools in Myanmar today are in the liberated zones of ethnic armies such as the KNU [Karen National Union] and parts of Kachin, Mon, and Shan States.”

On the day of the coup, most the senior National League for Democracy (NLD) leaders were detained, but a number of members of parliament escaped from the capital, Naypyidaw, and set up a an anti-coup Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), as Myanmar’s parliament is known. The committee claims to be the legitimate government as a representative of the NLD government that was re-elected in a landslide in the 2020 polls.

Amid the brutal crackdown, thousands have left the cities and headed for ethnic states. The CRPH has joined thousands of urban activists in fleeing from the military raids in urban areas on a mission to develop a parallel clandestine government, now being set up in under the protection of the ethnic peoples’ movements.

However a series of air strikes on Karen villages near the Karen National Liberation Army’s 5th Brigade sent more than 5,000 villagers fleeing to the Thai border seeking aid and sanctuary. This raises serious doubts as to the degree of protection ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) can provide against a major Tatmadaw offensive.

The KNU has also recommended that urban activists who wish to take up arms do not visit their areas, as they are already stretched to supply Karen people with food, shelter, and security, now with the additional influx of over a thousand refugees from the cities.

General Min Aung Hlaing’s regime has struggled to establish a functioning administration at home, while on the international front few countries have so far formally recognized Naypyidaw’s new regime.

The U.N. secretary general has strongly pledged to work for the restoration of democracy. His special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, has warned that no country should recognize or legitimize the junta

However the warning did not stop the representatives of eight countries from attending a Myanmar Armed Forces Day parade on March 27 – the same day the nation mourned the killing by police and military of 114 people, including bystanders and children.

Russia and China, major arms suppliers to the Tatmadaw, attended the event, along with India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Among Myanmar’s nine fellow member states of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN), only Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam attended. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, which have expressed alarm over the shooting of unarmed demonstrators, were conspicuously absent.

Meanwhile, a major international lobbying battle over which government will represent the people of Myanmar is likely unfold in the coming months leading to the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting in September.

Myanmar’s current ambassador to the United Nations, Kyaw Moe Tun, has lambasted the regime back home, making a passionate speech urging the U.N. to use “any means necessary to overturn the military coup.”

Despite being fired by the junta, Kyaw Moe Tun continues to work for U.N. recognition of the CRPH government. Many Myanmar diplomats abroad have also affirmed their allegiance to the ousted democratic government that appointed them.

There are various precedents for recognizing the CRPH as the legitimate government. The U.N. credentials committee will no doubt be reminded of the U.N. General Assembly verdict on the Cambodia seat in 1979 after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, and its ongoing recognition of a Cambodian coalition government in exile. This controversial precedent could be adapted to deny the U.N. seat to a regime that is driving Myanmar toward civil war.

However the clinching argument should be that the new head of state in Myanmar, Sen. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was cited as the general who ordered the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar’s west, according to a U.N. Fact-Finding Mission report published in 2018.

The U.N. report stated that “Myanmar’s top military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan States.”

If the junta cannot persuade the U.N. General Assembly to accept its credentials, that will be a huge victory for a CRPH parallel government. Even if China and Russia try to block this move, there could be a compromise option of leaving the seat vacant until democracy is restored.

The hopelessly unrealistic expectations of a speedy U.N. intervention or ASEAN pressure to halt the bloodshed are fast fading. The R2P (responsibility to protect) slogans seen on many protest posters and placards in the streets of Yangon represent a desperate appeal for U.N. humanitarian intervention, but so far the protocol has never been used to prevent to prevent crimes against humanity from taking place.

However, South argues that R2P status could be applied to the only organizations currently protecting civilians in Myanmar – the EAOs. “As the U.N. seems unable to protect the people of Myanmar,” South proposes, “it is imperative to recognize and support EAOs, who are struggling to provide assistance and protection both to ethnic nationality civilians targeted by the Myanmar Army, and to those fleeing from the SAC junta’s murderous violence in the towns and cities.”

As the killing continues unabated and U.N. action is blocked by Russia and China, this idea could have a special relevance as Myanmar moves dangerously close to civil war. A new humanitarian crisis is looming along the Thai-Burmese border after a several air force planes bombed Karen villages in zones patrolled by ethnic soldiers belonging to the Karen National Liberation Army. Thailand accepted 3,000 refugees on a temporary basis, but turned back another 2,000.

Western analysts and risk consultancies have generally concluded that despite the bravery and tenacity of Myanmar’s People Power, their struggle is doomed to defeat, given they are pitted against a ruthless military caste that has run the country for the last 70 years.

I recall how many diplomats and analysts routinely expressed the same attitude toward East Timor’s demands for independence, as if ending the Indonesian occupation was some absurd fantasy. I was told it would never happen. But by 2000 it had happened, and East Timor – now Timor-Leste – became the first new state of the 21st century.

Long–running dictatorships in Indonesia and Philippines were also overthrown by a combination of “people’s power” and other factors.

In the case of the Philippines, the defection of Gen. Fidel Ramos and the defense minister expedited the downfall of the dictator President Ferdinand Marcos. The United States then crafted the end-game. Marcos and his family were extracted from Manila in a U.S. helicopter, providing a safe exit to Hawaii.

Clearly a precise replica of that end-game is not possible in the case of Min Aung Hlaing and his junta. However, the defections of more than 600 police officers to the side of the CDM offers evidence that demoralization can happen side-by-side with brutal repression.

In just two months it is hardly surprising that the protest movement, despite massively successful boycotts and a general strike, has yet to topple one of Asia’s most entrenched and feared armed forces. But what they have achieved is the isolation of the regime, which is now floundering in a post-coup quagmire and hoping to somehow shoot their way out of the crisis.

No one knows if there are army captains or colonels who enjoyed Myanmar’s period of opening up and the economic growth of the last decade from 2011 until the coup – and are now seething with a secret anger. Are they quietly calculating the right moment to join the Spring Revolution, either as defectors or leaders of a mutiny?

What will be the end-game in Myanmar? It’s too soon to tell, but history has taught us not to count out the determination of the people, whether in Myanmar, the Philippines, or Timor-Leste. It could still be that Min Aung Hlaing is the one left scrambling for an exit strategy when all is said and done.",2021-04-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['win', 'min', 'protesters', 'karen', 'coup', 'ethnic', 'general', 'myanmar', 'military', 'myanmars', 'regime', 'crph']",India,news article,English
932,FL-2021-000021-IND,Glacier Outburst Flood: What Is It And How Does It Occur - NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/glacial-outburst-floods-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-occur-2365224,"The incident in Uttarakhand happened Sunday morning when a glacier burst in the Tapovan area.

A glacier break in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district triggered huge flooding on Sunday followed by the evacuation of thousands - living near Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers - to safety. The flooding damaged nearby Rishiganga and NTPC power plants. Officials said over 100 labourers working in the power plant are feared dead.

Five NDRF teams - one from Dehradun and four from Delhi - have been mobilised for the rescue operation. The Army has committed six columns, each with 100 soldiers. In addition, one Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) and two Cheetah helicopters are also operating.

But what is a glacier outburst? What causes this disaster?

Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occur from an unstable natural dam formed from a glacial retreat.

Glaciers are large bodies of ice moving slowly. So, when a glacier retreats, it leaves behind a large impression in the ground, filling it with water and a lake is formed. This is known as a moraine, which can be impounded by precarious pile of debris and buried ice, according to the encyclopedia maintained by the Canada-based University of Calgary.

The moraine dammed lakes weaken as the water level rises and the glacier retreats. They might crumble under pressure from the swelling lake, leading to massive floods, it says.

Glacial lakes may vary in volume but may hold millions to hundreds of millions of cubic metre of water, say experts.

The outburst of water can also happen due to erosion, an avalanche of snow or rock, an earthquake or volcanic eruptions under the ice.

""In the Hindu Kush Himalaya, moraine-dammed glacial lakes are common and numerous GLOF events have been traced back to the failure of moraine dams. A moraine-dammed lake forms as a glacier retreats, and meltwater fills the space between the proglacial moraine (in front of the glacier) and the retreating glacier"", reads the description of GLOFS on the official website of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. ICIMOD is an intergovernmental knowledge and learning centre working on behalf of the people of the Hindu Kush Himalayas.

The glacial outbursts are also related to global warming. As the temperature soars during summers, the glaciers retreat, leaving behind water-filled, unstable moraine dammed lakes.

The incident in Uttarakhand happened Sunday morning when a glacier burst in the Tapovan area. The avalanche also brought with it muck and debris in the river.",2021-02-07 08:00:00+00:00,"['working', 'glacier', 'flood', 'moraine', 'lakes', 'water', 'glacial', 'does', 'lake', 'occur', 'retreats', 'uttarakhand', 'outburst']",India,news article,English

GATINEAU, Quebec — Along the coast of the United States, people who lost homes to Hurricane Dorian are preparing to rebuild. But Canada — which has faced devastating flooding of its own — is testing a very different idea of disaster recovery: Forcing people to move.

Unlike the United States, which will repeatedly help pay for people to rebuild in place, Canada has responded to the escalating costs of climate change by limiting aid after disasters, and even telling people to leave their homes. It is an experiment that has exposed a complex mix of relief, anger and loss as entire neighborhoods are removed, house by house.

“Canadians are stubbornly beginning to reconsider the wisdom of building near flood-prone areas,” said Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor of environment and business at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. “It’s taking government action to obligate people to make better decisions.”

The real-world consequences of that philosophy are playing out in Gatineau, a city across the river from Ottawa that has been hit by two 100-year-floods since 2017. Residents here are waiting for officials to tell them if the damage from the latest flood, in April, exceeded 50 percent of the value of those homes.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Indus Water Commission (PCIW) will raise the issue of delaying flood data by India during the annual meeting of the commission on March 23-24.

The meeting is taking place after a hiatus of nearly three years, with the last being held in Lahore in August 2018.

Last year's meeting, which was earlier scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2020, was cancelled in view of the pandemic situation.

As per the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty, both the commissioners are required to meet at least once a year alternately in India and Pakistan.



Speaking to Geo News on Tuesday, Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehr Ali said the Pakistani delegation will leave for New Delhi on March 22 where the meeting would take place.

What will be discussed in the meeting?

Shah will lead the Pakistani delegation whereas the Indian side will be headed by PK Saxena.

Controversial projects of 1000 MW Pakkal Dal and 48 MW Lower Kalnai will be discussed during the two-day meeting. Pakistan has already raised objections on the design of these projects, he said.

The top official of the Indus Water Commission said two more water projects -Darbuk and Nemochaling  will also come under discussion, adding that the issue of delaying flood data will also be raised with New Delhi.

India has been violating the Indus Basin Agreement in providing flood data for 2 years. Pakistan wants daily flood data from July 1 to October 10, Mehar noted.

Source: ghananewsagency.org

The government of Ghana is determined to retool and reposition the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet), to become the best meteorological institution in the sub-region.



""The government has demonstrated this commitment by procuring a number of equipment such as automatic weather stations, calibration equipment, vehicles and a number of others”.



Mr Vincent Sowah Odotei, Deputy Minister of Communications, said this in Accra on Wednesday, at the opening of a National Consultative Workshop for the establishment of a National Framework for Climate Services in Ghana.



He said Ghana, is a Co-Chair of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Advocacy Group, was particularly keen on empowering the GMet, to take the needed climate action, in pursuance of the attainment of SDG 13.



""It is important for Ghana to tailor our climate services to the needs of end-users, and climate information should respond to the specific needs of users through the relevant forecast, based on advisory services and decision-making tools,"" said the Deputy Minister.



Mr. Odotei noted that the implementation of Ghana's National Framework for Climate Services required strong partnerships and collaboration with international organisations and user groups such as sectorial experts, government agencies, the private sector and the academia.



He said the government would support GMet, which was the lead agency in the implementation, to ensure that climate services were efficiently provided for the improvement of climate information products, predictions and outlook.



The Deputy Minister said the government through the Ministry of Communication would ensure that the framework was implemented to the letter.



He said flagship programmes being implemented by the government, such as the Planting for Food and Jobs, One village one Dam and One District One Factory were all climate reliant, which made the establishment of the national framework timely.



""The Ministry through GMet, would promote and strengthen public education campaigns to all end-users, on how climate plays a key role in their activities and informs their activities,"" Mr. Sowah said.



Dr. Michael Tanu, the Director-General of the Ghana Meteorological Agency, who chaired the programme, said climate change and the increase in the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, flash floods, landslides and rising temperatures in the midst of massive urbanization, ""threatens our very survival.""



He said National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, therefore, needed to develop early warning systems, to help mitigate the impact of these disasters as a matter of urgency.



Dr. Tanu added, ""though some work on this has been done in various agencies and institutions in the country, there is the need for collaboration and coordination for resilience.""

The north eastern and central parts of the country remained dry.

The cumulative rainfall forecast for this week indicates significant spread of the rains to the central and northern parts of the country starƟng from 18 to 20 April, this will mark the start of the rains in these areas. Some parts of Awdal Region may experience high localized rains of up to 50mm on 19 April 2020, according to the forecast. Similarly, moderate rains are expected over the southern and central parts of the country. In the Ethiopian highland, whose rainfall is largely responsible for increase in river flow along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers inside Somalia, moderate to high rainfall is foreseen in the coming one week.

It is worth noting that, the foreseen rains in the coming week are not sufficient to alleviate the current drought conditions in the country, more rains with good temporal and spatial distribution are required during the season in order to improve the situation.

River levels along the Shabelle have increased slightly at Belet Weyne over the last few days, but remains low and below the normal for this period of the year. Along Juba River the levels are within normal for this period. Given the rainfall forecast, a slight increase in the levels for both rivers is expected with no risk of flooding over the next seven days.

1009,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Global warming's extreme rains threaten Hawaii's coral reefs - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/global-warming-s-extreme-rains-threaten-hawaii-s-coral-reefs-1.5388981,"HONOLULU -- As muddy rainwater surged from Hawaii's steep seaside mountains and inundated residential communities last month, the damage caused by flooding was obvious - houses were destroyed and businesses swamped, landslides covered highways and raging rivers and streams were clogged with debris.

But extreme rain events predicted to become more common with human-caused global warming not only wreak havoc on land - the runoff from these increasingly severe storms also threatens Hawaii's coral reefs.

“These big events are the ones that have the greatest damage because they are the ones that put the most sediment and nutrients out onto the reef,” said C. Mark Eakin, senior coral advisor to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the former director of the agency's Coral Reef Watch program.

A warmer climate tends to amplify existing weather patterns, said Hawaii's state climatologist, Pao-Shin Chu, noting the islands have an overall wet climate and that powerful storms are expected to become more frequent.

“Given this climate change or global warming, as we have seen over the last hundred years, the atmospheric water vapour pressure is increasing,” said Chu. “We have some evidence showing that we already have some increasing, very intense rain.”

Coral reefs make up much of Hawaii's nearshore ocean ecosystem and are critical to the state's economy.

Hawaii's reefs protect populated shorelines from massive ocean swells and storm surges from tropical storms - a benefit the U.S. Geological Survey valued at more than $860 million a year.

Adding tourism, fishing, cultural value and other factors, the state's reefs are worth more than $33 billion, according to a NOAA-funded study.

March's flooding was caused by a weather system that stalled over the islands and brought two weeks of rain, much extremely heavy.

On Oahu's North Shore, “a very large flood wave” rushed down from the mountains and flooded the town of Haleiwa, said National Weather Service hydrologist Kevin Kodama.

“That's a big challenge in Hawaii, where we have small, steep watersheds,” Kodama said. “Most of the basins in the state will produce flash flooding.”

Last month had 11 flash flood events and was the wettest March in 15 years, he said.

The runoff problem is multifaceted. Deforestation and grading on construction sites and farms lead to increased runoff. Feral animals such as goats, pigs and deer clear vegetation, causing erosion and excessive sedimentation on reefs. And constant, low-level runoff carries gasoline and oil from roadways, household chemicals, trash and pesticides into the ocean.

Any significant change in ocean conditions, such as an influx of fresh water alone, can harm coral health. Contaminants and soil from land accumulate on reefs and can smother and kill the coral. Scientists say suspension of material in the water can also block sunlight coral needs to survive.

One of the biggest problems for Hawaii reefs is sewage. There are about 88,000 cesspools throughout the islands, many in coastal areas.

“Cesspools are essentially a hole in the ground where there is no treatment prior to wastewater entering the environment,” said Jamison Gove, a research oceanographer with NOAA who lives on Oahu's North Shore.

Cesspools leak into groundwater - and with heavy rains, they overflow and send pathogens and other harmful contaminants into the ocean.

In the town of Pupukea, where professional surfers compete at the famed Banzai Pipeline reef break, more than 330 million gallons (1.25 billion litres) of wastewater enters the ocean each year - enough to fill hundreds of Olympic size swimming pools.

On the North Shore during the recent flood, “brown, polluted water just blanketed the entire town,” Gove said. “You could just smell it everywhere.”

More than half the state's cesspools are on the Big Island, home to some of the state's most expansive and pristine coral reefs. And Gove said some areas have shown a clear decrease in coral cover where sewage routinely enters the ocean.

A reef off the town of Puako - an extensively monitored location - has seen significant losses, he said. Coral cover there has declined by about 70% since 1975.

“This is probably one of the more dramatic examples since coral cover is not this high in a lot of places,” he said. “But since we don't have this type of data everywhere, we can't say for sure this isn't a more common story.”

NOAA is providing data on the issue to the state, and efforts to remove cesspools and change infrastructure to slow and distribute floodwater could help Hawaii's reefs.

The state has banned cesspools in new construction and is attempting to remove the existing ones by 2050.

Although coral reefs worldwide face threats from global warming, including marine heatwaves that bleach and kill coral, storm runoff could prove a more serious and immediate threat to reefs in Hawaii.

“In Hawaii, I would rate runoff much higher than marine heatwaves in driving coral decline,” said Greg Asner, director of the Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science at Arizona State University.

In 2019, Asner and his team used imaging technology on aircraft coupled with satellite data to create new detailed maps of all living coral in the Hawaiian Islands. The data, now being used by federal and state scientists, shows a correlation between land-based pollutants from runoff and coral health.

“More runoff impacts reefs, mostly by mobilizing more chemicals and sediment on land,” Asner said. “Increased chemical pollution and sedimentation is a major driver of coral decline.”

March's floods were not the first of their kind.

A 2018 rainstorm on Kauai caused widespread flooding that cut off a community for weeks. The storm set a new U.S. record for rainfall in a single day with nearly 50 inches (127 centimetres).

Ku'ulei Rodgers, a coral reef ecologist at the University of Hawaii's Institute of Marine Biology, studied that 2018 flood as well as a 2002 flood in the same area. The 2002 rains swept earth from a construction site into the sea and “killed almost an entire reef,” Rodgers said.

After the 2018 flood, a review found fish abundance on a nearby reef had been reduced by 20% and urchins, which help clean reefs and keep coral healthy, were reduced by 40%.

When making policy decisions about how to safeguard reefs, Rodgers said, it's important to understand that land and oceans are intertwined.

“(Native) Hawaiians knew there was a connection between the two because whatever they did upland would affect their fishing downstream,” she said. “The better the watershed, the better the reef and vice versa.”",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'water', 'warmings', 'global', 'runoff', 'threaten', 'extreme', 'reef', 'reefs', 'state', 'rains', 'coral', 'states', 'town', 'hawaiis']",Kenya,news article,English
815,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Report: Basement flooding is the top climate change cost in Canada - Insurance Business Canada,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/flood/report-basement-flooding-is-the-top-climate-change-cost-in-canada-165200.aspx,"Citing data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the report said that the average cost to repair and remediate a flood basement in 2018 was $43,000 – a figure that could rise even more over time as basement flood incidents across the country continue to rise with the changing weather and climate.

According to the report, the most common factors that increase the risk of flooded basements in homes include ground level windows (82% of homes assessed), downspouts that deposit water less than two metres from the foundation of the structure (78%), basement drains with poor grading that directs water into the foundation (69%), and cracks in basement windows that allow seepage (63%).

The report also found that many Ontario households did not do enough to prevent water damage in their homes. Eighty-five per cent (85%) of Ontario households did not have a backup sump pump or backup power; 71% had furniture or electronics at risk of water damage; 53% had a lack of maintenance of backwater valves; and 40% failed to maintain their sump pumps.

Intact Centre discovered that 60% of participants would take action to reduce flood risk if the actions were simple, cost under $500, and could be completed by a homeowner in less than a day. Acting on that observation, the research centre has suggested 10 actions homeowners can carry out to reduce flood risk – all while costing under $250 (or even nothing at all, in some cases):

Remove debris from nearest storm drain

Correct grading around foundation

Clean eaves and extend downspouts

Install window wells ad covers

Keep floor drains clear

Store valuables in watertight containers

Test sump pump and install backup power

Install and maintain backwater valve

Repair or replace deteriorating pipes and appliances

Install and maintain flood alarms

“For many Canadians, their home is their biggest asset and ultimately their retirement fund,” said Intact Centre head and University of Waterloo professor Blair Feltmate in a statement. “To protect that investment, any homeowner who lives where it rains can easily and cost-effectively deploy simple measures to lower their chances of experiencing basement flooding.”",2019-04-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['change', 'report', 'water', 'centre', 'risk', 'maintain', 'canada', 'homes', 'sump', 'climate', 'cost', 'basement', 'flood', 'flooding', 'backup']",Canada,news article,English

KARACHI, Pakistan -- Three days of heavy monsoon rains triggering flash floods killed at least 58 people in various parts of Pakistan, as troops with boats rushed Sunday to evacuate people from flood-affected districts in the country's southern Sindh and southwestern Baluchistan provinces.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September, during which swelling rivers cause damage to crops and infrastructure.

According to Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority, 19 people were killed in rain-related incidents in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 12 in southern Sindh province, eight in Punjab province and 10 in the country's scenic northern Gligit Baltistan region in the past three days.

Rains also partially damaged about 100 homes and caused a breach in a flooded main canal, inundating villages in Sindh province. In a statement, the military said troops used boats to rescue stranded people and move them to safety. It said a medical camp was also established and food was being provided to the rescued people.

Heavy rains also lashed many districts in the southwestern Baluchistan province, killing eight people, damaging homes and inundating many villages in the district of Jhal Magsi, according to Saleem Zakir, spokesman for provincial disaster management authority. He said rescuers with the armys help were still trying to evacuate people from the district's flood-hit villages.

He said floods damaged a bridge and a gas pipeline and destroyed coastal roads on the Arabian Sea, severing links to the port of Gwadar, part of Chinas multi-billion dollar one-road project linking south and Central Asia to China.

According to local media reports, hundreds of people moved to nearby hills when the floodwaters entered their villages in remote areas of Baluchistan, and the military used helicopters and boats to move them to safer places. Authorities were dispatching tents and food for the flood-affected people.

Heavy rainfall began last week and continued Sunday, flooding streets even in the eastern city of Lahore. It especially disrupted normal life last week in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's commercial hub, where sewage flooded most of the streets, prompting Prime Minister Imran Khan to order the army to assist authorities in handling the situation.

According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue next week.

In Pakistan and neighboring India, deadly floods occur regularly during the monsoon season.

633,Drought Sri Lanka,New U.S.-Mexico agreement promises to restore water to Colorado River delta - Public Radio International PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-11-27/new-us-mexico-agreement-promises-restore-water-colorado-river-delta,"The Colorado River is just a dry mud bed where it once met the Gulf of California, in Mexico. (Photo by Peter McBride.)

The Colorado River runs 1,450 miles. It starts in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, then winds its way through Utah, Arizona, Nevada and California.

It crosses the border into Mexico and ends at the Sea of Cortez. Or more accurately, that’s where the riverbed ends.

The water stops flowing about 75 miles shy of its natural conclusion.

As urban areas and agricultural demands have increased up river, both in the United States and Mexico, the area down river, a vast expanse called the Colorado River Delta, has paid the price.

“The delta at one time was enormous. If it were in existence today I would speculate that it would be one of the eight wonders of the world, it was that massive and impressive a place,” said Patrick Graham with The Nature Conservancy in Arizona. “Today, it’s basically a dried mudflat.”

It’s been like this for nearly a half century, since the Glen Canyon Dam began holding back water in Arizona in 1960. Since then, only the wettest years have allowed some water to reach all the way to the delta.

Under a new agreement reached last week, the United States will get more water during times of drought. And in times of plenty, Mexico will be able to store excess water north of the border. But the Colorado River Delta also stands to benefit.

That’s welcome news to people like Francisco Zamora, who directs the Sonoran Institute’s Colorado River Delta program. He said when his group planted trees last year on 50 acres in the delta and provided a tiny amount of water for irrigation, the trees quickly bloomed.

“It’s really amazing how fast they grow and how quickly they produce habitat. We’ve seen many species of birds using the habitat, and other wildlife,"" he said. ""Mammals and the bobcat, and there are a few beavers we’ve seen along the river.""

Al from a tiny amount of water. Under the agreement reached this week, more than a thousand times as much water will be added to the delta, over a five-year period.

This water will come from Mexico’s share of the river. Or more specifically, from Mexican farmers who are willing to sell back some water on the open market. Overall, the plan calls for Mexican farmers to give back about three percent of their water allocation.

This loss should be offset by planned improvements to irrigation canals in Mexico.

There’s another source of water that’ll be coming to the Delta. Under the five-year agreement, there will also be a special, one-time only burst of water sent down river. This water is being collected and stored north of the border. And when it is released, all at once, it will mimic a natural springtime flow from a wet year.

Zamora says it’s not hard to predict what will happen.

“It will create a functional ecosystem that will benefit the species. And that’s what we learned, the delta is very resilient,"" he explained. ""You add water and the habitat comes back, the birds come back, the wildlife comes back. And that’s why the delta is a good example of hope.”

Zamora talks optimistically about the regeneration of endangered birds and fish in both Mexico and the southwestern United States. He also talks about the resurgence of commercial fish and recreational opportunities in the Delta.

“The way I describe it is we are kind of reconnecting the people with the river,"" he said.

And while this is undoubtedly good news for the conservation movement in Mexico and the southwestern United States, the amounts of water being restored to the Delta will be far smaller than what would’ve happened naturally 150 years ago.

The magnificent delta of old will likely never be restored, as least as long as people are around.

Graham said the new agreement is just a first step.

“But it’s a good first step, because for the first time the environment has been factored into these water management decisions at this scale,"" he said. ""And it’s not only important ecologically, but I think symbolically to provide the opportunity to restore the river, the delta.”

The new agreement could begin delivering additional water to the delta as early next spring.",2012-11-27 08:00:00+00:00,"['river', 'times', 'colorado', 'delta', 'water', 'mexico', 'usmexico', 'states', 'way', 'promises', 'restore', 'united', 'agreement']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The municipal authorities claim that compared to the original plan, the pre-monsoon desilting of major nallahs and rivers has reached 116 per cent with 2.94 lakh metric tonnes of silt removed from major nallahs. The Mithi river, which was the cause of major flooding in 2005, has also been desilted properly.

However, the Leader of Opposition in the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) Ravi Raja believes that the desilting process has been hampered due to the lockdown and only up to 30 per cent of the work has taken place. Since the city receives maximum rains in July, the people of Mumbai should brace for severe flooding, he cautioned.

The whole of Mumbai city has roadside surface drains of about 2,000 km. The underground and lateral drains measure 440 km.

Raja, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of MCGM, told BusinessLine that he has surveyed majors nallahs in the city and based on his assessment only 30 per cent desilting has been done. Therefore, the figure of 116 per cent declared by MCGM Commissioner IS Chahal needs to be explained further, he said. Every year, the process of cleaning is held for three months but still it gets flooded in the city, he added. But this year the contracts were awarded in February and the actual work started in March, but then the lockdown happened.

The contract labourers required for tough jobs started returning to their hometowns. Then how was this work achieved, he asked?

He said that rather than floating big contracts before the monsoon, MCGM should ask the contractors to keep the nallahs, small rivers and stormwater drains clean round the year; only then can the rain water movement remain obstruction-free and there would be no flooding in the city. The sites in the city where major civil works for metro rail is taking place is also expected to flood, Raja claimed.

Additional Municipal Commissioner (Project), P Velrasu, in a WhatsApp message said that MCGM contractors mainly used heavy machinery for cleaning and desilting of rivers, major and medium nallahs. So, they did not face any problem in cleaning. Labour is intensively used in minor nallahs. The work of cleaning them is taken up by ward offices. There are some issues but progress is satisfactory in all except five municipal wards. For metro rail works, a special meeting was convened at the level of the Chief Secretary and instructions were given to keep their sites safe from the monsoon perspective.

BusinessLine also reached out to MCGM Commissioner IS Chahal about the status of desilting and the claims made by Raja, but till the time of going to press there was no response from his office.",2020-07-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['city', 'municipal', 'greater', 'cleaning', 'original', 'desilting', 'rivers', 'mumbai', '116', 'mcgm', 'plan', 'work', 'major', 'nallahs', 'flooding', 'premonsoon']",India,news article,English
825,FL-2019-000179-CAN,What is flood insurance? | Insurance Business - Insurance Business,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/guides/what-is-flood-insurance-117640.aspx,"Types of water damage

There is an important distinction between the main types of events causing water-related losses: flood (explained above), sewer backup, and water damage. Sewer backup can happen when sewer systems experience an influx of high volumes of water from snowmelt or rainstorms, and as a result, wastewater or freshwater then backs up into a home through toilets or drains. Most home insurance policies offer coverage for damage related to sewer backup, though it may also need to be added. Customers can be confused by the difference between sewer backup coverage versus overland flood, which brokers can help address during conversations with insureds about their home insurance policies.

Water damage refers to the sudden or accidental flow of water into a property, and is caused by events not related to flooding or sewer backup, such as a pipe bursting, an overflowing tub, or a windstorm ripping a roof off a structure, causing rainfall to enter. Most home insurance policies also offer coverage for this type of damage, though policies tend to not include water that leaks into a structure, which can, for example, come from cracks in a foundation.

Causes of flood damage

While home insurance policies have not tended to cover the risk of overland flood, an increase in severe weather is causing more water-related damage and insurance claims, and has encouraged the insurance industry to re-evaluate its role in mitigating this risk. In September 2018, a thunderstorm brought 72 millimetres of rain to Toronto with over 70% of it falling during one hour, causing $80 million in insured damage from extensive flooding. The flood event in Windsor in August 2017 was, meanwhile, the largest catastrophic loss for Canadian insurers that year, with insurers paying out claims worth $165 million to those affected and the province of Ontario paying out close to $1.5 million through its Disaster Recovery Fund.

“Water has become the new fire,” said IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations for Ontario Pete Karageorgos. “There’s now more payouts for water than fire, which used to be the top source of claims. We’ve seen this across the province and the nation.” Climate change along with the disappearance of wetlands, aging infrastructure, and unfinished basements have contributed to the surge in claims, added Karageorgos.

From all of the extreme weather events that impact Canadians, flooding is currently the costliest, ringing up millions of dollars in property damage, according to a study from the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo. Using data from IBC, the study also outlined that 58% of catastrophic insurable loss claims from 2008 to 2015 were a result of water damage, demonstrating the rising threat that flood waters pose to Canadians.

What coverage is offered by home insurance policies?

An IBC public opinion poll in 2018 found that almost 45% of homeowners in Canada who have a ground-level home believe they have flood insurance included in their regular home insurance policy, while 26% don’t know if they have it or not. Adding to this, only 37% say they feel confident in their understanding of what is covered in their home insurance policies.

“The fact is that most Canadians are not financially protected against flooding, and they may not realize it,” commented Craig Stewart, IBC’s vice president of federal affairs. “Climate change is not a future threat – it’s happening now. Over the past three decades we have seen an increase in insured damages, and it is up to all of us – the insurance industry, governments and citizens – to do our part in responding to the effects of climate change.”

Brokers can help educate policyholders by first outlining the type of insurance they have in place for their home, condo, or rented property. All-risk or comprehensive policies will protect against all losses except for what’s excluded, which commonly lists flood. If that’s the case, brokers can guide insureds to purchase additional protection for water damage stemming from flooding. Allstate, for instance, offers an enhanced water damage endorsement that includes sewer backup as well as water overflow from a freshwater source, rainfall, or accumulation of ground or surface water.

These add-ons also often take into account the location of a home. Desjardins’ base policy includes protection for water damage events and optional coverage with ground water losses or sewer backup. Customers in low-risk areas can also receive protection for damage caused by overflowing waterways or dam breaks, but those located in medium-risk areas will have to purchase coverage for an added premium. IBC estimates that more than 1.7 million Canadian homes are at risk of flooding, and has worked with the provinces to provide a complete list of flood maps to help consumers and insurers understand the level of flood risk facing properties.",2018-11-30 08:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'coverage', 'claims', 'sewer', 'flood', 'damage', 'flooding', 'policies', 'insurance', 'backup']",Canada,news article,English

The two German giants and last season's title rivals go head-to-head in the tradtitional season curtain-raiser

The 2019-20 German football season begins on Saturday with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich taking on runners-up Borussia Dortmund in the DFL-Supercup at Signal Iduna Park.

The two sides were involved in a thrilling title race last time out as Dortmund led for much of the campaign only for a late collapse to allow Bayern to seal a seventh successive Bundesliga title on the final day of the campaign.

It has been a summer of change though for Niko Kovac’s side as they begin a campaign without both Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben for the first time in nearly a decade.

Dortmund have also been busy reshaping their squad with the likes of Thorgan Hazard and Julian Brandt bolstering an already fearsome-looking forward line as they look to win the title for the first time since 2012.

Match Preview

Borussia Dortmund boss Lucien Favre insists “there are no more friendlies” as his side prepare to take on Bayern Munich in the traditional German season curtain-raiser.

Last season’s runners-up Dortmund will again be expected to challenge Bayern for the Bundesliga title this time around so will be looking to lay down a psychological marker for the title race ahead with victory on Saturday.

Dortmund have won all five of their pre-season matches so far, scoring 24 goals, including a 3-2 victory over European champions Liverpool.

And though there are still two weeks to go until the Bundesliga kicks-off, Favre is demanding his side treat Saturday’s game as a competitive fixture.

""There's currently no team out there that can be ready (for the season),"" he told the club’s website.

""(But) we still need to prepare ourselves well for this match. The Super Cup is the Super Cup. There are no more friendlies.”

Those thoughts have been echoed by Favre’s opposite number Niko Kovac as he begins his second season in charge at the Allianz Arena.

Kovac found himself under pressure in the early months of his tenure in Bavaria as a poor start to the season saw Bayern fall behind in the title race. However, a mid-season revival allowed Bayern to claw away at Dortmund's lead before ultimately claiming the 28th Bundesliga title in their history on the final day of the campaign.

Bayern have won three, lost one and drawn one in pre-season so far – with that draw against Tottenham leading to a penalty shoot-out defeat as the Premier League side claimed the Audi Cup earlier this week.

891,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Floods on record-high Lake Victoria expose need for water cooperation - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-floods-environment-trfn-idUSKCN25F1YU,"BUDALANGI, Kenya (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenya’s western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called “backflow”.

“We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,” said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

“There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,” said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lake’s water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

“Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Uganda’s Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Uganda’s environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the “speedy movement of water into the lakes and rivers” feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoria’s shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

“While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,” Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenya’s government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

“The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,” Opere said.",2020-08-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['floods', 'school', 'rainfall', 'recordhigh', 'water', 'rivers', 'uganda', 'dams', 'flooding', 'lake', 'expose', 'climate', 'need', 'victoria', 'cooperation']",Egypt,news article,English
745,FL-2016-000114-EGY,What Causes Flash Floods in the Middle East? - Eos,https://eos.org/research-spotlights/what-causes-flash-floods-in-the-middle-east,"Across the vast expanse of the Middle East, the climate varies with the terrain, but it is typically hot and dry throughout most of the region. Extreme precipitation events, although rare, are a crucial part of the region’s climate. These sporadic storms recharge the area’s freshwater stocks, supporting agriculture in the otherwise dry environment. But they can also cause deadly and economically devastating floods. Researchers have long sought a better understanding of the factors driving extreme precipitation events in the Middle East to improve our ability to predict major storms. This endeavor has been made both more complicated and more urgent by climate change.

Previous studies have linked heavy-rainfall events to two atmospheric features. Stratospheric potential vorticity (PV) intrusions, which occur when air from the stratosphere invades the upper troposphere, have been shown to precede extreme precipitation events in, for example, the Alps, southern Africa, and northwestern Africa. Atmospheric rivers, in which moisture travels along plume-like tracks, have been linked to rain and flooding in North America and Europe. Atmospheric rivers are often detected using vertically integrated water vapor fluxes (IVT), but few studies have looked at data on both IVT and PV intrusions.

Here de Vries et al. combined both into a single algorithm to detect extreme precipitation in an area covering eastern Egypt, southern Israel, Jordan, and parts of Saudi Arabia—all regions with low annual rainfall that have, nonetheless, been hit repeatedly with devastating rainfall events. The authors used data from a global reanalysis project, Interim-ERA, to identify stratospheric PV intrusions and IVT structures from 1979 to 2015 as well as extreme precipitation events, defined as days with rainfall that exceeds the 97.5th percentile.

First, the team demonstrated the success of the algorithm for four major precipitation events that inflicted severe damage in the Middle East: a 1979 storm that killed 50 people and displaced over 66,000, a 1994 storm that killed 600 people, another in 2005 that killed 29 people, and another in 2009 that caused 161 deaths and $900 million in damages. The authors found that in all four cases, stratospheric PV intrusions and IVT structures were clearly apparent. Next, a climatological analysis showed that PV and IVT features coincided with nearly 90% of all extreme precipitation days over the 37-year study period. Both PV and IVT occurrences were highly associated with the precipitation severity and mirrored seasonal rain trends, frequently appearing in October and tapering off around May. The longer the features persisted, the farther south the PV intrusions extended; the larger the IVT values were, the more extreme the rainfall was. IVT incursions were a particularly strong predictor of extreme precipitation days.

False alarms—or days in which both IVT and PV intrusions were present but the weather was dry—were not infrequent, but the authors found that in many of those cases, a key ingredient for extreme rainfall was missing: high tropospheric moisture content.

Finally, the authors evaluated the performance of the algorithm against precipitation observations. PV and IVT features contributed to about 40%–70% of the annual rainfall amounts and 50%–90% of the extreme precipitation days. This result provides strong evidence of the importance of PV and IVT in extreme precipitation events in the region.

Ultimately, the algorithm allows researchers to identify local-scale extreme rainfall events on the basis of large-scale meteorological features. The tool could help to improve both weather forecasts and warning systems and could help researchers evaluate how extreme precipitation events respond to a changing global climate.

Under the noonday sun, Alimatu Alidu uses a stone to grind tomato, red pepper, and small crayfish into a red paste. Drops of sweat collect on her forehead, just below her black headscarf. She adds the paste along with other ingredients into a cooking pot balanced upon a make-shift stove, consisting of two uneven rocks with a small fire burning between them. Once her mixture is sufficiently heated, she adds the final element: boiled cowpea beans. Known as poor people’s meat, these faded yellow legumes with a big black dot along the curve are ubiquitous throughout West Africa, including here in Ghana. Other days, Alidu prepares cowpea fritters, or koose, whipping ground cowpea and water into a batter, adding spices, then frying individually rolled balls to be served for breakfast. She can make five different dishes from cowpea beans, which grow in green pods that are up to 12 inches long. Soon the spicy dish, known as red-red, is fully cooked and ready for Alidu’s 16-person family, which includes herself, her husband, their six children, and her husband’s second wife and their seven children. Together, they live in thatch huts that surround this open-air kitchen in the northern village of Zinindo.

Cowpea is a staple in Ghana and other parts of West Africa, where it is believed to have first been domesticated. The legume is a favorite among farmers and laborers, who consume it in the morning before leaving for work and don’t feel hungry until sundown. At her doctor’s request, Alidu increased her own consumption when she was pregnant, and she used the ground seeds to wean her children. Cowpea is a mainstay of school lunches in Ghana. Because the crop can be harvested within two months of sowing, it fills the “hunger gap” for poor families between May and August when other crops, such as maize, are still young in the field. And cowpea tolerates droughts, which are increasing across sub-Saharan Africa. Every woman in Zinindo keeps some cowpea in her home, says Alidu. But cowpea has been under attack for years. A winged pest, Maruca vitrata, bores into the pods and nibbles away at the seeds, destroying anywhere between 20 and 80% of West Africa’s cowpea crops every year. In response, scientists have genetically modified cowpea plant lines to resist the pest, and advocates for the technology—which involves altering an organism’s DNA in ways that aren’t possible through traditional breeding—believe that genetically modified (GM) cowpea can help feed the fast-growing population on a warming planet. It can also help reduce the use of pesticides, they say, freeing up land for other uses, providing enough surplus for regional market opportunities, and giving farmers an additional choice about what to grow. Ghana plans to release GM cowpea sometime this year or next, which would make it the third sub-Saharan African country, after South Africa and Nigeria, to approve the local production and sale of GM food.

advertisement

What worries some critics is that all of Africa’s genetic-modification projects are closely tied to Western organizations. Licenses for the patented genes that African scientists use to modify cowpea crops, for example, were provided royalty-free by biotech companies such as Monsanto (since acquired by Bayer)—inviting questions about whether their goals are purely humanitarian. Further, social scientists warn that GM seeds are being pushed by international donors without fully taking into account the agriculture practices of poor farmers and the specific crop characteristics that they most want and need. While some African scientists are working tirelessly to reassure laypeople that GM foods are safe, it’s clear that safety concerns, however unfounded, are not the only challenge standing in the way of GM cowpea in Ghana. Here in this rural village, Alidu and other poor farmers have not been following these controversies. But they say they are open to new approaches that would minimize pests, allowing them to grow enough cowpea to feed their families with a surplus to sell. In the wake of outcry, an effort to restore their public image The roots of GM cowpea date back to the 1990s, when the Rockefeller Foundation, a New York-based philanthropy, entered into a series of conversations with companies that own many of the genes used to modify food, including Monsanto, DuPont, and Syngenta. Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation believed that biotechnology could help poor countries grow more food. But they understood the companies were unlikely to invest in genetically modifying so-called orphan crops such as cowpea, cooking banana, and cassava, which aren’t traded internationally and are often grown and eaten by farmers without the financial means to purchase expensive GM seeds.

advertisement

Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation proposed that the companies donate the genes to research institutes in developing countries. Researchers at those institutes would then use the genes to develop seeds for orphan crops that could resist pests, tolerate drought and excess salt, and enhance nutrition. A humanitarian organization would be created specifically to facilitate a partnership between the companies, philanthropic and governmental organizations, and the local scientists. The companies initially rejected the proposal, but ultimately accepted the plan after internal discussions about how the partnership could restore their public image. Across the globe, the anti-GM movement had accused the biotech industry of monopolizing the world’s seed supply. Amid this and other criticisms, the companies agreed to an alliance. But they had conditions. The biotech companies wanted Asia and Latin America “off the table” because business was thriving in these regions. The companies also wanted strict licensing contracts that specified where, when, and to whom they would make the genes available royalty-free. These historical details were published in a paper by University of Minnesota sociologist Rachel Schurman, who had interviewed employees of the Rockefeller Foundation, biotech companies, and scientists in Africa.

advertisement

The Rockefeller Foundation agreed to these terms and soon found an additional partner—the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which at that time was also trying to forge partnerships between U.S. universities, biotech companies, and research institutions in developing countries to increase the global acceptance of biotech products. USAID representatives say that their agency promotes biotechnology when conventional breeding is too slow or ineffective to improve a given crop. Over time, other big donors such as UK Aid, and corporations such as PepsiCo, joined the coalition. These groups reached out to African scientists, many of whom believe that biotechnology can solve some of African agriculture’s problems. In 2004, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation was launched. This Nairobi-based nonprofit now coordinates many of the GM research projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Two years later, it formed the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB), an advocacy arm tasked with changing the public’s negative perception of GM products. Today, with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, OFAB organizes meetings between scientists, farmers, and the media. In Ghana, supporters of GM cowpea welcome Western support and believe the international partnerships serve the interests of local farmers. Anti-GM groups, however, don’t trust the companies or their technology. “There is no free lunch,” says Edwin Kweku Andoh Baffour, a spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, the most active anti-GM group in the country.

advertisement

For now, OFAB appears to be making inroads. A number of Ghanian journalists said that after attending its workshops, they felt better equipped to address misconceptions. For example, doctored images of animal-shaped fruits—supposedly created by inserting animal genes into fruit seeds—had been making the rounds on social media. “More scientists are coming forward to change public perception,” says Joseph Opoku Gakpo, an Accra-based journalist who has attended GM workshops. A mother’s skepticism One day in January, Alidu joins a small group in a prayer led by an old man under a grass-thatched shed near her house. After the prayer is finished, the old man introduces Mohammed Adams Nashiru, head of a farmers’ group in the region. Ghanian scientists have improved cowpea to fight off one of its pests, explains Nashiru. This could benefit local farmers, some of whom see half their cowpea destroyed by field pests in a given year. With this new cowpea, farmers will be able to grow more using less insecticide.

advertisement

Alidu is skeptical. For one, she and some of Zinindo’s farmers already intercrop cowpea, which lessens pest infestation. Further, though the farmers’ group leader assures the group that the seeds will be available soon, he is one of many government officials, traders, and researchers who have visited the village with promises to improve farmers’ lives. According to Alidu, none of them have ever returned. In stark contrast to his work today, roughly three years ago, Nashiru was leading marches in northern Ghana against GM crops. He says he had a change of heart in 2014 at an OFAB workshop where Walter Sandow Alhassan—former head of Ghana’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research—told an audience of farmers and journalists that GM food has been rigorously tested and is safe to eat. People in the United States, he noted, have been eating genetically modified food for many years. “He said that nothing happened to them,” says Nashiru. “There is no need to worry.” Two years later, a report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that there is “no substantiated evidence” that GM crops are less safe than non-GM crops.

advertisement

Although scientists and the OFAB are working to get that message out—with some scientists even asking their pastors to let them speak about GM food after Sunday prayers—changing public perception “is extremely challenging,” says Vivian Oduro, a plant scientist with the Biotechnology and Nuclear Agriculture Research Institute in Accra. In Ghana, the debate around GM food is highly polarized, as it is elsewhere in the world, even in the U.S., where resistance has paralleled a growing demand for organic foods and clear labeling of genetically modified products. “This is a very connected movement,” says Mark Lynas, a former anti-GM activist turned science writer. “I often see European and U.S. themes quickly picked up by anti-GM activists in Africa.” But Lynas also notes that as people are exposed to a wider variety of facts and opinions—beyond the simple anti-GM narrative—their own views tend to become less entrenched. Many now say they don’t know enough about the technology to be for or against it. Oduro remembers a debate organized by a government ministry in Accra last year, where the audience was asked to vote on the introduction of GM foods. After Oduro explained the science of genetic modification, a different speaker quoted a controversial 2012 study by French scientist Gilles-Éric Séralini. The study showed Séralini’s lab rats developed cancer after eating GM corn. (The paper was retracted the following year after a review found that “the conclusions described in the article were unreliable.”) The speaker also announced that waakye, a popular cowpea delicacy slow-cooked with rice, would be made using that same technology.

advertisement

That made Oduro furious. In her next turn to speak, she appealed to the audience as a fellow Ghanian and as the daughter of a farmer. She and her family eat cowpea, she said. Why would she promote something she believed to be harmful? In fact, experiments show that GM cowpea is not just safe, it also yields about .85 tons more per acre than conventional varieties. And although the GM seeds will be about 50% more expensive than conventional seeds, according to one estimate, they will require just two rounds of pesticides, rather than the current five to six. That will cut overall production costs by 5 to 10%. But, says Oduro, once someone has stirred up fear, it is difficult to convince people not to be afraid. That day, the audience voted against genetically modified crops.

advertisement

A couple days later, the aggregated online news site GhanaWeb posted an article about Oduro’s public statements. In the comments section, somebody called Oduro a “dirty bitch.” Someone else called her a “foolish woman.” Alhassan has even been the target of online death threats. In 2015, an Accra-based newspaper ran an article that quoted him saying genetically modified food is safe. “Shoot alhassan on the throat. IDIOT!” wrote one commenter after the article was posted on GhanaWeb. “Prof. Walter Sandow Alhassan must die now,” wrote another. Baffour, the spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, says that he doesn’t believe studies such as the ones analyzed in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report. He maintains that other studies show GM crops are not safe, because they have “unintended risks,” though when questioned he didn’t explain what those risks might be. And when asked for examples, he was not able to provide any that were published in peer-reviewed journals. According to Baffour, organic food is “natural” and “obviously the future of the world.” Organic food, however, is expensive to grow because it requires more labor and costly herbal insecticides, which farmers like Alidu cannot afford. This is why biotech scientists say it’s best to offer choices and let farmers decide which seeds best meet their needs.

advertisement

Anti-GM marches have occurred across Ghana, with many of them centered in Accra. But Nashiru characterizes the marches as a “show for media.” When he used to help organize them, he says he would call village farmers, hand them placards they couldn’t read, and pay them for their efforts. The farmers didn’t even know what they were marching for. Interviews with a wide range of Ghanians revealed some reservations about genetically modified foods. Wouldn’t there be something wrong, they wondered, with a crop that even insects won’t eat? Some maintained that the foods looked “too clean,” though few had actually seen these foods. Richard Ampadu-Ameyaw, Ghana coordinator for OFAB, thinks it is best to train leaders like Nashiru, whose community ties and farming background lend him credibility in the eyes of local community members. Yet there are notable differences between Nashiru’s life and the lives of the poor farmers. For one, he has traveled internationally. He also owns 250 acres of land, much more than a farmer like Alidu, who owns just five acres.

465,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,THE LAST WORD: The problem with term limits - Independent,https://www.independent.co.ug/last-word-problem-term-limits/,"As Sierra Leone’s president seeks to amend the constitution and extend his presidency, it is time for Africa to pause and reflect

By Andrew M. Mwenda

The president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, wants to amend the constitution and remove term limits on the presidency. Koroma is not the first and will not be the last president of an African country to attempt this. Many others have done it with success while a few have failed. Yet each time a country attempts to remove term limits, we have a standard explanation: the leader is greedy for power. Since the 1990s, we have regurgitated this explanation, reducing a social issue to the character of an individual.

Term limits were entrenched in the constitutions of many nations of Africa in the 1990s and 2000s. From thence, the efforts to remove them have been widespread in many countries regardless of how the government that seeks to remove them came to power: whether it was through an election victory by an opposition party, a military coup, an armed struggle, a popular insurrection or a peaceful succession after the death of an incumbent president.

The countries that have attempted it have different regime types in different regions of the continent; different bases of power, their leaders have different age, the colonial masters were different, etc. So why does this diversity produce the same politics? Anyone can infer from this that the problem is not leaders but term limits. Theoretically, term limits are an attractive innovation but they seem not well suited to the political circumstances of some nations. Hence, each time to respect term limits comes; the political elite seek to remove them.

Africa needs to think! Term limits may be too much ado over little or nothing. Most of Europe does not have them. Some leaders of Western European democracies in the post-World War Two era have served for long: President Urho Kekkonen of Finland did 26 years, Prime Ministers Tage Erlander of Sweden and Ainar Gerhardsen of Norway did 23 and 17 years respectively. Therefore, long tenure by leaders is not distinctly African. But all too often poorly performing governments get voted out of office.

Even Africa does not need term limits to change governments. In Senegal, presidents Abdou Diouf and Abdoulaye Wade were both defeated by rivals as happened in Benin against Mathieu Kerekou and Nicephore Soglo, Madagascar against Didier Ratsiraka, Congo Brazaville against Denis Sassou Nguesso, Malawi against Kamuzu Banda and Joyce Banda, in Zambia against Kenneth Kaunda and Rupia Banda, in Nigeria against Goodluck Jonathan, most recently in Ghana against John Mahama and in Gambia against Yahya Jammeh. In all these cases, poorly performing incumbents were shown the exit by irate voters without need for term limits.

Secondly Africans are not passive victims of manipulative leaders. Some leaders in Africa tried to remove term limits and failed – Frederick Chiluba in Zambia, Bakili Muluzi in Malawi and Olusegun Obasanjo in Nigeria. Blaise Compaoré in Burkina Faso was in 2015 chased out of power by angry youths for attempting to remove term limits. In DRC, the opposition last year succeeded (at least for now) in stopping President Joseph Kabila from amending the constitution to remove term limits and he has agreed on a retirement timetable.",2017-04-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['constitution', 'africa', 'does', 'term', 'leaders', 'president', 'limits', 'word', 'remove', 'problem', 'power', 'different']",Ghana,news article,English
452,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Transforming The Society Through Education - GNAT - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/transforming-the-society-through-education-gnat/,"GNAT is the biggest public sector union in the country, and her mission and visions are collectively achieved through the efforts putten into doing hard work.

In her speech delivered at the Kumasi Metro’s 5th quadrennial Delegates Conference held at the GNAT Hall on 12th April, 2017, the acting national president of GNAT, Mrs. Philippa Lawson said, teaches are wonderful people whose contributions towards national development cannot be over emphasized.

Saying that, the teacher at all times influences the lives of people positively. ” Our job cuts across all facets of life, for the dedication and meritorious services we render in and outside the classroom, I say AYEKOO to all teachers for your tireless efforts in making the country what it is and what it will be in the future.”

According to Mrs. Lawson, the association does not take unilateral decisions. Decision making starts at the grassroot level which is the basic unit through all the levels. And said since the delegates are representing their various districts, they would be able to come out with the best resolutions that will benefit all teachers.

The theme for the conference, “Transforming Society Through Education : The Role Of The Teacher Towards Agenda 2030”, is appropriate. “The world is changing at a very fast pace and therefore, there is the need for us to change our way of doing things and for that matter, teaching. Bearing in mind that, we are the pivot around which transformation and development revolves.

That is why GNAT is an association prioritizing the professional developments of its members. Even though, it’s the duty of the Ghana Education Service to retrain teachers to sharpen our skills, GNAT in collaboration with Canadian Teachers Federation, organises workshops for it’s members in three regions across the country for free. And this year the GNAT/CTF program will be organized in Accra, Central and Western regions.” Mrs. Lawson noted.

Hinting on the role of the teacher towards agenda 2030, she outlined the following;

* There is the need for them to adapt to change and be ready accept new views, methods and techniques, move away from traditional waysof doing things and use scientific methods.

* The teacher should be a facilitator and not a lecturer.

* Should have in depth knowledge on the learners and how fast they are growing in terms of technology.

* Teacher must be curious in acquiring professional knowledge of education framework and curriculum learners, identify gaps in knowledge and go beyond textbooks.

* Exhibit professional attitudes and values, knowing very well that, they are role models for the children and to name a few.

She continued that, their major pressing concerns as teachers, are the issues of validations of their promotions, Tier two pension, Souvenirs and salaries. But their officer have met her for a lengthy discussion and the details will be made known to the national council in order to address all their concerns.

Present at the gathering was the former regional director of education, Mr. J. K Onyinah, to grace the occasion.

537,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Community Mining Programme Must Halt 'Galamsey' Activities - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907290364.html,"THE PRESIDENT, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo, on Wednesday, launched the Community Mining Programme (CMP), at Wassa Akropong, in the Western Region.

According to the aim of the programme, mining in communities will now be formalised across the country.

Under the programme, at least one community mine is expected to be set up in each of the mining districts in the country.

The community mines are expected to provide employment to more than 4,500 miners who have been trained by the government at the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT) at Tarkwa.

According to the President, the programme will ensure that ""mining will be done the right way, within the tenets of the law, and will not destroy our natural resources.

""Today, we are launching a type of mining that will benefit all of us. I am here to plead with the young men who are participating in the community mining to do their best to adhere to all the laws and do a good job, so that money will return to Wassa Amenfi,"" he said.

President Akufo-Addo assured that the programme would be replicated in other towns in Ghana by September this year, and would be closely monitored to ensure that the standards that have been set for the CMP were adhered to.

The Ghanaian Times commends government for the establishment of community mines, which is part of efforts to stop galamsey in the country.

Indeed, it is an important step taken by the government, not only to regulate small scale mining and offer secure jobs for small scale miners, but also to prevent destruction of the environment.

As a matter of fact, many Ghanaians have been worried over the impact of galamsey on the environment, particularly on water bodies, farms and the forest and have advocated for a complete ban on illegal mining activities.

It is, therefore, welcoming news that the community mining programme would be replicated in other towns across the country.

Although the government has assured that the programme would be monitored, we call for stringent supervision and policing of the activities of the miners who would be engaging in the CMP.

We say so because of the difficulties we face as a nation, in the fight against galamsey.

The country is yet to stop illegal mining in spite of all the efforts that have been made through the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on illegal Mining.

We hope that the community mining concept would eventually become the attraction for the illegal miners and drive them away from galamsey.

We urge the youth to embrace the new programme and support the government strategy to stop illegal mining, so that we can all save the environment.",2019-07-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['wassa', 'miners', 'mining', 'community', 'mines', 'halt', 'illegal', 'small', 'activities', 'galamsey', 'programme', 'towns', 'ghana', 'stop']",Ghana,news article,English

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have been displaced as a result of heavy rains, which triggered floods and landslides and caused havoc in several parts of Uganda, a top government official said on Sunday.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

""This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,"" said Ecweru.

""We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,"" he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

""We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,"" said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

He spoke at the public presentation of 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) tagged Managing Flood for Sustainable Development in COVID-19 Era organised by NIHSA, yesterday, in Abuja.

Adamu said that 302 local government areas in 36 states, including Federal Capital Territory ( FCT), would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 councils in 28 states would be within the highly probable risk areas.

This year, like 2020, we will be grappling with the two threats of the COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene challenges as well as the impending floods as predicted in the AFO. The 2021 floods levels will be higher than in the previous years but will not attain the levels of the 2012 that was devastating, he said.

The minister also warned that states contiguous to Rivers Niger and Benue, including Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nassarawa and Kogi, are likely to experience river flooding.

Others are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and Bayelsa states. Coastal flooding is expected to affect Rivers, Cross River, Bayelsa, Delta, Lagos and Ondo states.

Flash and urban floods from heavy inundation are predicted to occur in some major cities. The severity would depend on availability and adequacy of drainage systems and adherence to urban planning regulations.

Adamu, therefore, called on all stakeholders, including policy makers and agencies, to rise up to the challenge of impending floods and threats of COVID-19.

Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nzeh, said: States and relevant authorities as well as farmers must take the flood outlook serious by putting in place measures to mitigated its impact.

There is a greater awareness for this years outlook in terms of the level of participation and political will, looking at representation, including governors, senators and key agencies. I believe they are going to cascade this to the grassroots.

The ceremony, according to President Akufo-Addo, was in fulfilment of one of the campaign promises he made to the chiefs and people of Axim in 2016.

The President who was on his second day tour of the Western Region said he promised the chiefs and people of the Axim area during his campaign period that if he was voted as the president, he would make sure the landing beach was built for the fisher folks to have a good place to bring their catch on land.

The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Mrs Elizabeth Afoley Quaye, thanked the chiefs and people for their collaboration for a successful close season, saying the start of the project showed that the government was very much concerned about the fishing industry and the coastal areas.

She indicated that the project would bring about job creation and increase the food and nutritional values of the people of the area and the country at large.

According to her, infrastructural development was key to the development of the fishing industry, and advised the people to put an end to the use of wrong fishing gears and light to bring sanity to the industry.

The Omanhene of Axim, Awulae Attibrukusu III, noted that the project had been on the drawing board for years, adding that the ground breaking showed that President Akufo-Addo came to fulfil his campaign promise.

He bemoaned the state of the Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital, which never befitted the region, and pleaded with the president to build a new regional hospital for the Western Region.

President Akufo-Addo used the occasion to register his displeasure at the attack on the Omanhene of the Lower Dixcove Traditional Area, Nana Kwasi Agyemeng IX, by some unknown assailants, stressing it was most unfortunate, and asked the security agencies to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to book.

In a related development, the Chief of Sekyere Hemang, Nana Kwedukyerefuor II, thanked the president for the implementation of his government's Free Senior High School policy.

The policy, which was implemented in September 2017, had seen some 270,000 more students enrolled into senior high schools across the country in two academic years, with all students in senior high schools, from September 2019, set to be covered by the policy.

At the time of the accident, the train was passing a section of the tracks between a rocky hillside and the Rhine River, near the small town of Bacharach. Parts of the railway were also underwater due to heavy rainfall in recent days.

The rain caused several minor landslides in the area, leaving debris on the tracks. Both the tracks and the overhead power cables will need to be fixed before traffic can continue, Deutsche Bahn said.

Police stated that the cliff side also needed to be secured. Trains are running again on the right side of the Rhine river, but parts of the left side are still blocked.

25,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Population explosion - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/08/14/population-explosion,"HAOWA was already struggling to feed five children before she gave birth to triplets in the Gabi region of southern Niger 19 months ago. Now, when her babies scream for food she often finds herself helpless. “If they cry and I have nothing to give them, then I must let them cry,” she says, cradling two infants who bear the hallmarks of malnutrition. Their hair is yellowing, their bellies are distended and their expressions glazed. They lack the energy to shake the flies from their faces. It is a dismal but depressingly common picture in west Africa’s largest country.

Niger is, by the reckoning of the UN’s Human Development Index, the poorest place on earth. Most of its inhabitants eke out a living growing subsistence crops on small plots of dusty, infertile land. Despite this agricultural bias, the drought-stricken country cannot feed itself, even in good years. An estimated 2.5m people out of a total of 17m have no secure source of food. When harvests fail, which they do almost annually, that number shoots up. In 2012, when the worst of the recent food crises ravaged the Sahel region, almost a quarter of Niger’s population was said to be going hungry, prompting desperate relief campaigns by international donors.

This perpetual food crisis is compounded by doggedly high fertility rates. With an average of 7.6 children per woman, Niger has the world’s highest rates. Poverty, ignorance and poor access to contraception are contributing factors, as are cultural issues like competition between wives. Men in Niger tend to be polygamous, and local doctors note that their spouses often try to prove their value by outdoing each other in child births. This contributes to Niger having the highest population growth rate on earth. At current projections, the number of inhabitants will more than triple between now and 2050 to 55m.

In such circumstances, demographers mostly agree, family planning is key. Two years ago, only 12% of women in Niger professed to use modern contraceptive methods. That is a reasonable increase on rates of 5% in 2005 but dismally low by global standards. About 50% of women of child-bearing age use modern contraceptives in Rwanda and Zimbabwe.

The improvements that have been registered are, in large part, the work of donors. Across the country, foreign-funded health centres are promoting long-term options like contraceptive implants; local health workers are being trained to distribute other prophylactics. At present the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the only importer of contraceptives, flying in millions of dollars’ worth this year. It runs a “school for husbands” which teaches men, who traditionally tended to obstruct women seeking birth control, about family planning. The schools hope to dispel wild rumours about contraception. One woman living outside of Zinder, the country’s second-biggest city, used to believe the pill would cause haemorrhages or make her unborn child anaemic. “I was scared for the first two months,” she says.

The political will to improve things is weak: the government professes support but allocates only a tiny proportion of its budget to family planning. And the appetite for change among the population is limited. Only about a quarter of women express any desire to space out their births, let alone reduce their number. More than 20 years ago Niger identified population control as a priority in the fight against poverty. But birth rates are still rising.",2014-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['rates', 'ago', 'niger', 'planning', 'number', 'birth', 'family', 'women', 'population', 'explosion', 'food']",China,news article,English

KOCHI: As they returned to their homes to take stock of the situation after three days at various relief camps, the sight that welcomed them is not pretty: refrigerators taken over by African snails, television sets and washing machines water-clogged and the floors that are filled with water and dirt.

""We are here for cleaning the house. We will return back to the relief camp in the evening,"" said Ambika Anandan, who complains that she's yet to get the washing liquid and the bleaching powder from the local authorities.

Her husband T S Anandan, a lottery ticket seller for the last 30 years, says a fortune has been lost in the rains and the consequent opening of the Idamalayar and Idukki dam last week. ""Our washing machine, fridge and several other electric equipments were lost in the flood. We have to rebuild everything from scratch again,"" he says.

Further down the road, C P Usha, chairperson, Eloor Municipality and her team including M A James, vice-chairperson and Chandramati Kunjappan, health chairman, were on the field overseeing the cleaning and rehabilitation drive. ""A team led by CPM workers have been involved in distributing bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) and quicklime to households. It will take several days for the situation to return back to normal,"" said Usha, adding that nearly 86 per cent of the water has receded in the area.

Shivan R, joint secretary of CPM Eloor East Zone, who lives in the area, has been volunteering along with 400 DYFI comrades from Thrikkakkara to help the people in cleaning up their houses, besides distributing bleaching powder to the households.

A clutch of the houses at the 15th ward of Eloor belongs to Tamils, who have made this their home some 42 years back. ""We have faced even harsher floods during 2013. We had lost everything then. Though the government had promised all help then too, nothing came in our way,"" says Periyaswamy, when told about the government promise of Rs 10 lakh for those who have lost their houses, and Rs 6 lakh for those who have lost their land.

56,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Five Risks to ASEAN Growth - Global Risk Insights,https://globalriskinsights.com/2015/10/five-risks-to-asean-growth/,"Last week, the Asian Development Bank downgraded the 2015/2016 growth rate forecasts for most ASEAN countries, and the region as a whole. The latest revised figures revel some of the risks that continue to challenge growth prospects in the region.

Sub-regional growth has been revised down to 4.4 percent from an initial forecast of 4.9 percent, owning to various domestic factors such as disappointing growth in Thailand, slow government spending in Indonesia and the Philippines, wavering business confidence in Malaysia, and external shocks such as falling global energy prices and slowing growth in China.











(Source: Asian Development Outlook Supplement, July 2015, Asian Development Outlook 2015 Update: Enabling Women, Energizing Asia. Key: yellow: initial forecast in March, green: forecast unchanged, red: downward revision, blue: upward revision)

The latest cut in growth figures underlines the major risks and uncertainties that continue to weaken growth prospects in Southeast Asia. Five risks in particular will threaten growth in the ASEAN.

Internal political struggles

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has reported slowed government spending in the region, as well as waning business confidence. For instance, Indonesia is dealing with a political struggle between the ruling coalition and opposition camp in the House of Representatives. This in turn has hampered projections for government infrastructure spending for much of 2015.

Similarly, public spending will gradually accelerate but is expected to miss government targets. Furthermore, due to lack of unity within his administration, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has reshuffled his cabinet.

Thailand’s level of public spending is recovering from the political disruptions in 2014, and has started to pick up this year, but projections still lag behind goals. The 1MDB corruption scandal in Malaysia has led to a deprecation of the Ringgit, and has undermined business confidence.

Elections generate post-election uncertainties

November elections in Myanmar and 2016 elections in the Philippines also add uncertainty to the growth prospects in those countries. The ADB sees greater than usual uncertainty for the Philippines; business is concerned as to whether a new administration would continue with the current economic reform agendas. Particular concern exists in the infrastructure, social welfare, and education sectors, where the current administration has made significant progress.

In the case of Myanmar, businesses are concerned about who will be president following the historic election in November this year. The role of the military is expected to remain dominant, while Aung San Suu Kyi, though constitutionally barred from the highest post, is expected to see her party (NLD) perform well.

Hence, the power struggle between the military and pro-democracy political parties will persist.

Droughts and floods hurt agriculture

Southeast Asia is one of the world’s most disaster prone regions, yet is also heavily reliant on agriculture. Floods and droughts caused by El Niño in several Southeast Asian countries have hurt the agricultural sector. Myanmar has experienced the worst floods in decades this year, and is expected to see both production and export reductions for rice and other crops.

In Thailand, drought has hit agricultural output hard. With declining rural incomes and high household debt, private consumption in 2015 will be slow. Similarly, Indonesia is suffering its worst drought since 2010; with as much as 80% of the country affected. The Philippines also saw no year-on-year growth in agricultural production in the first half of 2015. Drought conditions in Vietnam have also damaged coffee and rice production and if prolonged could further weaken growth in the agricultural sector while pushing up food prices into 2016.

Low energy prices retard government revenues

Falls in prices for energy and other commodities have also hurt the growth of some ASEAN countries. Low oil and gas prices have crumpled government income in Brunei, which relies on hydrocarbons for two-thirds of its GDP. The ADB has reported that export revenue for crude oil, refined petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas in Malaysia plummeted, the result of the steep drop in oil and gas prices.

Slow growth in China hurts ASEAN

ADB has also cut down the growth forecasts for China from 7.2 percent in March down to 6.8 percent for 2015, and from 7 percent to 6.7 percent for 2016. China is the largest trading patenr of many Southeast Asian countries, and the largest partner of ASEAN, as a whole. Weak demand from China has undermined exports performance in many Southeast Asian countries.

Optimism remains

While the ADB has slashed growth forecasts for the region for 2016, it expects growth to rebound in 2016 to 4.9 percent with improvements in exports and accelerated infrastructure spending.

The inauguration of the ASEAN Economic Community at the end of this year will also see a strengthening of trade links between member countries and a step towards an integrated market.

Tourism, one of the vital industries of many SEA countries, has also remained resilient and continues to drive growth, particularly in Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines.",2015-10-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['risks', 'growth', 'philippines', '2015', 'prices', 'political', 'southeast', 'business', 'countries', 'asean', 'spending', 'asian']",Somalia,news article,English

June 30 (UPI) -- As June winds down, the Southwest monsoon is in full force across India, and rainfall totals are climbing to staggering levels as rising floodwaters leave thousands stranded.

During a five-day stretch from June 23-28, Cherrapunji, located in a region of India to the northeast of Bangladesh, reported 77.51 inches. Around 22.52 inches of that total fell in the last 24 hours of that stretch, stated AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jim Andrews.

As of Friday, the leading edge of the monsoon advanced through the country and moved into Pakistan.

Widespread rainfall totals of 8 or more inches have been measured along the western coast of India, across the center of the country and into northeastern regions since the monsoon arrived throughout the month, according to the India Meteorological Department.

RELATED India moves air defense missiles to Chinese border

In addition to impressive rainfall totals, runoff from northern India has caused multiple rivers across Bangladesh to rise over 30 inches above dangerous levels on Monday, Bangladesh Water Development Board Northern division chief engineer Jotiy Prasad Gosh said.

Gosh added that the rise in water levels flooded 19 upazilas, or regions, leaving 200,000 people stranded and thousands of hectares of farmland submerged under floodwaters.

Many in the region are still waiting for relief as officials process the requests for help from the upazilas, reported New Age Bangladesh.

The wet season will remain in full swing across the region as occasional showers and thunderstorms persist in much of India and Bangladesh each day through midweek. However, parts of extreme northwestern India will remain largely dry, including New Delhi, which had the onset of the monsoon last week.

The areas most at risk for flooding through the middle of the week will be areas that have already been hit hard by monsoon rain this month.

Heavy thunderstorms are expected to unfold in parts of northeastern India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan each day this week, with some locations potentially receiving 12 inches of rain through Friday.

Meanwhile, drenching downpours will remain across southwestern India from around Mumbai to western Karnataka in the coming days.

The heaviest rain in southwestern India will fall from near the coast into the Western Ghats.

Daily rainfall totals of 2 inches to 4 inches are expected for areas that receive the heaviest rain into the end of the week. An AccuWeather Local StormMax of 8 inches will be possible, especially in the rugged terrain.

By the end of the week and into the weekend, a monsoon low can develop in northeastern India and lead to locally heavy rainfall in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. This low may eventually bring the return of rain to National Capitol Region later in the weekend and early next week.",2020-06-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['rainfall', 'totals', 'bangladesh', 'torrential', 'severe', '200000', 'rain', 'strands', 'produces', 'inches', 'region', 'week', 'india', 'monsoon', 'western', 'flooding']",India,news article,English

Local authorities patrolled the streets in cars equipped with loudspeakers, urging those who live on the alluvial fans (soil deposits from the Nile river) to evacuate.

Governor Hisham Amna sent a letter to the heads of the local cities located on the Nile, urging them to ready themselves for the possibility of flooding throughout the next three days.

The letter was issued to the cities of Kom Hamada, Itay al-Barud, Shoubrakhit, Rahmaniyah, Mahmoudeya, and Rashid.

The governor called on the cities to immediately evacuate all at-risk buildings — including houses, farms, retail stores, and fish cages — located on the river’s soil deposits.

Additionally, Amna prompted the cities to inform all citizens of the risk of possible property damage and/or loss due to the floods.

The rights to the land surrounding the Nile in these cities are held by the government, however, many people living in these cities build agricultural, livestock, and fish farms as well as housing on the areas.

Better.,https://eatdrinkbetter.com/articles/hersheys-chocolate/,"Tens of thousands join campaign calling on Hershey’s Chocolate Company to refund fees foreign students paid for cultural exchange program they claim was “captive labor.”

More than 55,000 people from across the U.S. have joined an exploding campaign on Change.org calling on Hershey’s Chocolate Company to refund the program fees of foreign exchange students who claim they were held captive and exploited in sweatshop-like conditions at a Hershey’s factory.

Hundreds of foreign students paid to come to America this summer as part of a cultural exchange program promising opportunities to learn English and experience American culture while working. Instead, the students claim they were forced to work in back-breaking, round-the-clock production lines packing chocolates at the Hershey’s Chocolate Company Packing Plant in Pennsylvania for wages as low as $1/hour after mandatory deductions. When the students complained, they claim factory managers threatened to have them deported.

“We did not plan to become organizers in America,” said Decebal Bilan, an economics student from Romania. “But now it is our responsibility to bring Hershey’s to justice – for ourselves, for future students, and for Pennsylvania.”

The students organized with the help of the National Guestworker Alliance, and on August 17, they staged a sit-in at the plant. The students asked Hershey’s to end the exploitation of student workers at its packing plant, return the money they paid for the cultural exchange program, and make these jobs living wage jobs for local Pennsylvania workers. They also launched a petition on Change.org, the world’s fastest growing social action platform, which has gathered over 55,000 signatures.

“The immense outpouring of support on Change.org has been a tremendous morale boost for the students and an indication of the severity of the injustices they have faced,” said Saket Soni, executive director of the National Guestworker Alliance, which helped the students organize. “We hope the massive public support for these students will demonstrate to Hershey that they must make amends and commit to making these jobs living wage jobs for local workers, with rights.”

Hershey has offered the students free bus tickets and paid vacation time but has yet to respond directly to any of the students’ demands. If you want to let Hershey’s know how you feel, you can sign the Change.org petition demanding that these students get their fees back.

""In the Financial Year 2020-21, Rs 1,041 crore has been allocated to Uttarakhand under the SDRF fund. The first instalment of Rs 468 crore, has already been sanctioned to the state. We are taking all necessary precautions to step up safety and rehab work,"" he added.

12 people from the NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation), along with 15 people from Rishi Ganga projects have been safely evacuated from a tunnel in the affected area, Shah further informed,

""About 25-35 people could be stuck in a tunnel of a different NTPC project. Rescue efforts are underway to evacuate them,"" he said, adding that one NTPC hydropower project that was under construction on the Dhauliganga River in the lower area was damaged by the flash floods.

The Home Minister further informed that the Uttarakhand government has said that the floods no longer pose a threat to the low-lying areas and the water level is receding.

After his address, members of Rajya Sabha observed a moment of silence to pay tribute to the victims of the incident.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Tuesday conducted an aerial survey of areas affected due to the glacier burst and visited the ITBP hospital in Joshimath, Chamoli where injured people have been admitted.

Hundreds of people have been killed by floodwaters in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia which have also displaced hundreds of thousands across the region.

Heavy overnight rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in Western Uganda after the River Nyamwamba burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, a senior government official said.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, said by telephone.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also overrun by the gushing waters despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

In Ethiopia, the Somali region in the east of the country has borne the brunt of the floods, which have displaced more than 100,000 people, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

In neighbouring Somalia, an unspecified number of people were killed when floods washed away an entire small town in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Nairobi-based Kenyatta University, said.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

Nearly 200 people in Kenya have been killed by the floods, which have also displaced 100,000 more.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman told a news conference.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

A top source speaks to Goal about how late paperwork will deny regular first-team players action against the Porcupines

Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) side, Kano Pillars may not be putting their best foot forward when they begin their quest in the Caf Champions League against Asante Kotoko this weekend.

A top source from the club informed Goal, due to late paperwork, about five first-team players won’t be taking part in the preliminary first-round fixtures.

“Almost four to five first-team players will not be available for the games against Kotoko because they just got their international passports and were not registered for the game,” the club source revealed to Goal.

Even though the identities of the affected players were not revealed, Goal understands David Ebuka, the breakout star of the 2018 Higher Institution Football League (Hifl) will not feature in the two games against Kotoko.

Ebuka was in action for Pillars in their last friendly on Sunday in which the 2019 Federation Cup champions defeated local side Sosso FC 3-0. The young striker got one of the goals in the big win.

Meanwhile, after initially staying in Kaduna to prepare for the crunch tie with Kotoko, Pillars returned to Kano on Monday to round off their preparations for Saturday's tie at the Sani Abacha Stadium.

But getting people to actually do something about it may be the next phase in the battle to prevent catastrophic warming.

Over the course of the last year, I’ve spoken with people in different communities around the world who are trying to do what they can to make a difference, even if they can’t see the effects.

In a small village in the English countryside, residents have been working for 10 years to make their community carbon neutral — they’ve insulated their homes, hung laundry out to dry and installed solar panels. Part of their success has been in their approach: This should be fun, and it should involve all of us, because all of us stand to benefit from staving off the worst effects of climate change.

They have tried to connect the global problem of climate change to normal life, because it’s not always about the melting polar ice caps or apocalyptic drought. Yes, climate change is about those things, but it is also about the ways that life in the 21st century makes most people, especially those in the developed world, part of the problem.

How are your own habits connected to larger environmental problems? How much power are you still using even when you’ve switched off your devices? How many plastic bottles of water do you drink every week, and how does that affect the environment and other people around you?

Andi Jatmiko, The Associated Press





JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian navy divers have recovered the cockpit voice recorder of a Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in January, killing all 62 people on board, officials said Wednesday.

Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said divers retrieved the cockpit recorder at about 08.00 p.m. Tuesday local time, near where the flight data recorder was recovered three days after the accident.

The contents of the recorder were not immediately available. However, the device could help investigators determine what caused the Boeing 737-500 to nosedive into the ocean in heavy rain shortly after it took off from Jakarta on Jan. 9.

If the voice recorder is undamaged, it might tell investigators what the pilots were doing - or failing to do - to regain control of the plane during its brief, erratic flight.

Searchers have recovered plane parts and human remains from an area between Lancang and Laki islands in the Thousand Island chain, just north of Jakarta. The flight data recorder tracked hundreds of parameters showing how the plane was being operated.

Most retrieval efforts ended about two weeks after the crash, but a limited search is continuing for the missing memory unit of the cockpit voice recorder, which apparently broke away from other parts of the device during the crash.

The bright orange voice recorder was taken to Jakarta and given to the National Transportation Safety Committee, which is overseeing the accident investigation.

“We hope the KNKT could share information about what is contained in this VCR to improve our aviation safety,” Sumadi said, referring to Indonesian acronym for the transportation committee.

The KNKT chairman, Soerjanto Tjahjono, said the device will be taken to the investigators' “black box” facility. It will take five to seven days to dry and clean the device and to download its data, he said.

“Without the CVR . . . it would be difficult to determine the cause of the plane crash,” Tjahjono said, “We would disclose it transparently to avoid similar accidents in the future.”

Rear Adm. Abdul Rasyid Kacong, the navy's western region fleet commander, said the voice recorder was buried under 1 metre (3 feet) of seabed mud at a depth of 23 metres (75 feet). Divers removed debris and carried out “desludging” operations to reach the voice recorder, he said.

Data from a preliminary investigation report, which didn't state any conclusions, showed that the plane's left engine's throttle lever moved backward on its own while the autopilot was engaged, reducing the power output of that engine before the jet plunged into the sea.

That report provided new details on persistent problems with an autothrottle on the 737-500 Sriwijaya Air jet and the airline's efforts to fix them. An autothrottle can be used by pilots to set the speed automatically, thereby reducing workload and wear on the engines.

It also might help answer questions for those who lost people in the disaster.

“I warmly welcome the CVR finding . . . this is some relief from our despair,” said Rafik Yusuf Alaydrus, whose wife Panca Widia Nursanti, a teacher, died in the crash.

“We hope this could answer what caused the crash, especially for us who lost our loved ones,” he said.

The 26-year-old jet had been out of service for almost nine months because of flight cutbacks due to the pandemic before resuming commercial flights in December.

The disaster has reignited concerns about safety in the aviation industry, which has grown quickly along with the economy since the fall of dictator Suharto in the late 1990s. The United States banned Indonesian carriers from operating in the country in 2007 but lifted that restriction in 2016, citing improved compliance with international aviation standards. The European Union lifted a similar ban in 2018.

Sriwijaya Air had had only minor safety incidents in the past, though a farmer was killed in 2008 when a plane went off the runway while landing due to a hydraulic issue.

Roger Federer attempts to return a shot between his legs to Argentina's Juan Monaco during their US Open match on Monday. Emmanuel Dunand / AFP

NEW YORK - Roger Federer waited at the US Open for hours, eager to get on court for his fourth-round match. Once he finally started playing, shortly before midnight, he didn't take long to win.

Still, Federer enjoyed each of the 82 minutes he needed to hit 14 aces - including four in one game - and generally overwhelm 36th-ranked Juan Monaco of Argentina 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 in a match that ended shortly before 1:15 am local time on Tuesday.

""Other sports start at 8 in the morning, like golf. It's crazy how our schedules change all the time. As tennis players, it makes it extremely difficult to be on your 'A' game every single day,"" said Federer, whose record 16 Grand Slam titles include five at the US Open.

He watched some of the match before his in Arthur Ashe Stadium - No 1 Caroline Wozniacki's victory over No 15 Svetlana Kuznetsova, which lasted 3 hours, 2 minutes - and also warmed up several times, grabbed a bite to eat, and tried to relax.

""Your body is also jumping out of your skin because you want to go, then you're held back again,"" he said. ""It's tough.""

There was also the matter of the mist that started falling early in the third set, raising the possibility of a rain delay - or even a suspension of the match, with a resumption on Tuesday afternoon.

""There was not much margin there for us because it was already so late,"" Federer said. ""So one rain delay and probably they would have sent everybody home.""

The third-seeded Swiss had 42 winners and only 21 unforced errors against Monaco in a match that took 1 hour, 22 minutes, less than half the time it took Wozniacki to get through.

As late as Federer-Monaco ended, it doesn't even rank among the 10 latest-finishing matches in tournament history. The record is 2:26 a.m., for a Sept 4, 1993, match in which Mats Wilander beat Mikael Pernfors.

Given all the time-wasting before he got on court, Federer liked the way he played.

""I'm extremely pleased with my reaction out there,"" he said. ""I played really well, crisp, nice. I felt fantastic.""

Federer played brilliantly right from the start, taking the first five games - and 20 of the first 25 points - in only 12 minutes. He didn't miss a beat in the second set, hitting four aces in his opening service game.

""Roger was playing unbelievable. I didn't have time to play,"" Monaco said. ""The ball was coming very fast, he was serving unbelievable and I couldn't be quick like I can be in most of my matches.""

But he also blamed himself for not preparing properly.

""Maybe I made a mistake: I warmed up about five hours before the match. We'd been waiting for four hours in the locker room,"" Monaco said. ""I got on the court, I'm feeling a little tight. Then during the match, it takes me some time to feel my legs.""

Federer reached his 30th consecutive major quarterfinal.

He also earned a rematch against 11th-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who pulled off a stunner in the Wimbledon quarterfinals two months ago by becoming the first man to beat Federer in a Grand Slam match after dropping the first two sets.

""It's sure something I'm looking forward to. Look, I live for the big matches, live for playing a guy who is explosive, has got some firepower,"" Federer said. ""I like to play those kind of players, especially now that we're in the deeper stages of the tournament.""

1250,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil's Bem Querer dam: An impending Amazon disaster (commentary) - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/11/brazils-bem-querer-dam-an-impending-amazon-disaster-commentary/,"Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has announced his administration’s priorities for Amazon dams, including the planned Bem Querer dam on the Rio Branco in the far-northern state of Roraima.

Bem Querer is primarily intended to increase the energy supply to industries in locations outside of Amazonia, rather than for residents of Roraima.

Probable environmental impacts include blocking fish migrations and flooding a riparian forest that possesses extraordinary bird diversity. Downstream flow alteration would impact protected areas, including two Ramsar wetland biodiversity sites. Riverside dwellers would also be impacted.

Sediment flow blockage would impact fisheries and the unique Anavilhanas Archipelago, a spectacular Brazilian national park. These adverse impacts need to be fully evaluated before a decision to build is made. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

The text of this commentary is updated from an earlier Portuguese-language version of the author’s column at Amazônia Real.

Brazilian Amazonia already has more than a dozen large hydroelectric dams, and their development history is not good: severe human and environmental impacts, and benefits far below those envisaged by the proponents at the time decisions were made to build the dams. The lessons of this history have not been learned, and today the government is moving fast in its preparations for yet another dam facing serious questions — the Bem Querer Dam, proposed to block the Rio Branco in Roraima state, to become operational in 2028 with 650 MW installed capacity (EPE, 2020, p. 71) (Figure 1).

President Jair Bolsonaro has announced his priorities for building more Amazon dams, including Bem Querer (Figure 2). Bem Querer is one of three large dams to be built under Brazil’s current 2020-2029 ten-year energy expansion plan, although more dams could be added to the list if the Bolsonaro administration succeeds in its declared objective of removing restrictions on building dams in Indigenous areas.

The Bem Querer dam’s socio-environmental impacts would be large indeed. It would flood a 130-kilometer stretch of the Rio Branco, eliminating the aquatic ecosystems in this high-biodiversity river (Figure 3). The flooding would also eliminate riparian forests upstream of the dam. Downstream of the dam, flow alterations and other effects would directly impact three conservation units (Viruá National Park and the Niquiá and Caracaraí Ecological Stations); Viruá is a Ramsar wetland biodiversity site. Blockage of fish migration and other impacts would indirectly affect almost all conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity) in Roraima (ICMBio, 2013, p. 64).

The dam would impact an especially great diversity of birds in the areas sacrificed to flooding. It would emit greenhouse gases, especially methane. It would alter the hydrological regime downstream, an effect that has killed large areas of flooded forest downstream of the Balbina Dam in the neighboring state of Amazonas.

The human population along the river below the Bem Querer dam will suffer from the change in the hydrological regime, as well as from the decrease in fishing caused by the blockage of fish migration and the decreases of both oxygen and nutrients in the water.

The decrease in nutrients will occur due to sediment retention in the reservoir because the nutrients are associated with the sediment particles. The Rio Branco has a lot of sediments, which is why it got the name “Rio Branco” (meaning “white river”). The decrease in sediments downstream of dams causes erosion of the stream bottom and of the river banks, as is now occurring in the Madeira River, where sediments decreased by 30% after the Santo Antônio and Jirau Dams were built. The decrease in nutrients caused by sediment retention undermines the entire food chain that supports fish populations (Figure 4).

The Rio Branco’s sediments are also essential for maintaining the ecosystems of the Anavilhanas Archipelago (Figure 5) that was formed from these sediments in the Rio Negro, just downstream of its confluence with the Rio Branco. In fact, the Bem Querer dam threatens several jewels of the Brazilian national park system. The Anavilhanas and Jaú National Parks, as well as the Rio Negro State Park, are all in the impacted stretch of the Rio Negro and are part of both the Rio Negro Ramsar wetland biodiversity site and UNESCO’s Central Amazon Biosphere Reserve. Anavilhanas and Jaú are also part of the Central Amazon Conservation Complex, recognized since 2003 on UNESCO’s World Heritage list.

Almost the entire length of the Rio Branco between the proposed dam and the river’s confluence with the Rio Negro is composed of conservation units, including “sustainable use” conservation units. This is also the case for the Rio Negro between the Rio Branco confluence and the outskirts of Manaus (Figure 6). All would be impacted.

Roraima does not need the Bem Querer dam. The state’s population is small and it has the best potential for solar energy among the nine states in Brazil’s Legal Amazon Region. The dam does not eliminate the planned transmission line to Manaus, which requires consultation with the Waimri-Atroari Indigenous people whose territory it would traverse. That line is officially justified as a means of transmitting electricity from Manaus to Roraima. Manaus is already electrically connected to the Tucuruí Dam in the state of Pará, from which this city of 2.2 million currently receives power via a transmission line completed in 2013.

Most of the energy that would be generated by Bem Querer is not intended for the people of Roraima, but rather for other parts of Brazil. The electricity would be transmitted to Manaus to allow more of Tucurui’s power to be transmitted to Brazil’s industrial southeast region, or if joined by other planned dams, to transmit power from Bem Querer via Manaus to the rest of Brazil.

A representative of Brazil’s Energy Research Company (Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, or EPE), which is a part of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (Figure 7), explained this energy transmission scheme at a public event in Boa Vista in July 2018. Since Roraima is in the northern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed in relation to the rest of Brazil. Therefore, the energy generated in Roraima — when there is a lot of rain there — can be transmitted to the south of the equator when water is lacking to use all of the hydroelectric capacity there. This logic is explained in detail on the EPE website.

The EPE representative at the Boa Vista event concluded that Roraima had received a lot of support from the federal government over the years, and so “Now is the time for Roraima to make [a sacrifice] for Brazil.” This viewpoint represents yet another example of the impact of Amazonian dams in terms of environmental justice.

To reach sensible conclusions about major infrastructure projects like the Bem Querer dam, the impacts, benefits and alternatives need to be surveyed and considered before the initial decisions are made. This information needs to be collected and presented without bias and should be disseminated and debated democratically as part of decision making.

Such critically important decisions cannot be made — as it is done today in the licensing process — as a mere formality to legalize a decision already taken.

Amazonian dams have much greater impacts than other energy alternatives such as wind and solar power. Brazil has an extraordinary potential for both of these alternative sources, as confirmed by the country’s recently released 2050 National Energy Plan, but the priority continues to be for building more dams.

At least 18 people died in the disaster.

Teams are trying to free 37 workers trapped in a tunnel.

More than three dozen people remained trapped Monday in a tunnel filled with debris and mud after it was slammed by a wall of water unleashed when part of a glacier broke free in northern India.

The flood happened Sunday morning when part of the Nanda Devi glacier snapped off and released the water trapped behind it.

The tunnel is at one of two power plants damaged when the floodwaters roared down a mountain in the northern state of Uttarakhand and smashed through two dams and inundated villages.

At least 18 people were killed in the disaster and 165 are missing in the Chamoli district, according to the Associated Press.

In addition to the two hydroelectric plants, an unknown number of houses were destroyed and several bridges were washed away, the Indian Express reported.

About 13 villages have been cut off because of the destroyed bridges, the Times of India reported. Helicopters are flying supplies to them.

Advertisement More than 2,000 rescuers were taking part in the operation to free 37 workers at the Tapovan-Vishnugad power plant, which was under construction at the time of the flood.

The teams, including members of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the National Disaster Response Force, have cleared about 425 feet of debris and muddy slurry in the tunnel but still have two to three hours to go, the Times of India reported.

Teams also are searching for bodies downstream along the banks of the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers.

Experts said the disaster could be linked to global warming.

Melting can cause lakes to form on glaciers. Rising temperatures can speed up that melting and the trapped water can rise to potentially dangerous levels, AP reported.

The increasing water pressure or seismic activity can cause the glacier to burst and unleash the water.

“There are many glaciers and glacial dammed lakes across the Himalayas, but most are unmonitored,” Sarah Das, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, told AP. “Many of these lakes are upstream of steep river valleys and have the potential to cause extreme flooding when they break. Where these floods reach inhabited regions and sensitive infrastructure, things will be catastrophic.""

1259,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Brazil Has Weakened Dozens of Environmental Laws During the Pandemic - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/digest/brazil-has-weakened-dozens-of-environmental-laws-during-the-pandemic,"Since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, Brazil has approved 57 pieces of legislation that weaken environmental laws, from relaxing forest protections to declassifying the toxicity of dozens of pesticides, according to a new analysis published in the journal Biological Conservation. Almost half of this legislation, 27 bills, was passed during the height of Brazil’s Covid-19 pandemic, from March to September 2020.

The study also found that the issuing of environmental fines for illegal deforestation dropped by more than 70 percent during the pandemic. This is despite a 9.5 percent increase in deforestation in the Amazon over the past year. The research was led by scientists in Brazil, Britain, and the United States.

“The current administration is taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to intensify a pattern of weakening environmental protection in Brazil,” the study authors wrote. “This has the potential to intensify ongoing loss of biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and the likelihood of other zoonotic disease outbreaks, and inflict substantial harm to traditional and indigenous peoples.”

The study authors used data from the Official Gazette of the Union, the legal newspaper of Brazil that publishes records of all decrees and changes in legislation. They also examined monthly deforestation data from Brazil’s National Institute for Spatial Research (INPE) and records of environmental fines from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA).

In April 2020, Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told other government ministers at a meeting to take advantage of how “the media attention is almost exclusively on Covid… to open the flood gates and change all the rules and simplify the norms.” In the months following Salles’ statement, Brazilian lawmakers and officials did just that. In July, 47 pesticides had their toxicity classifications either lowered or eliminated, the study found. In June, another piece of legislation made it “no longer necessary to restore all permanent environmental conservation areas, even if they are illegally deforested,” SciDev.net reported. The amount of biodiesel added to Brazilian diesel was decreased, from 12 to 10 percent. Laws began allowing mining permits in designated areas even before final authorization and environmental reviews were complete. And several military leaders were appointed to environmental agencies.

Ayaz Younus, 25, died on the way to his first day at a new job when his car became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on March 24.

The Australian resident was the first victim of the floods that ravaged parts of Sydney's west, and had been on the phone to emergency services before he died.

He was a software engineer who had recently completed his masters degree. He was to start his job as a driver for a multinational company.

The funeral for Mr Younus was delayed because of a coronial inquiry as well as efforts to have his family attend the funeral from Pakistan.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia has helped pay for the family's travel, accommodation and funeral costs.

It said a request for Mr Younus' three siblings to fly from Pakistan had been denied by the Australian government.

His parents arrived in Australia on Sunday and immediately went into quarantine.

The association said the man's parents had been given an exemption by the Australian government to attend part of the funeral, and it hoped it could negotiate for the parents to be able to attend the burial site.

Hamad Chaudhry, who knew Mr Younus through the association, remembers him as a keen sportsman who was very involved with the community.

""Ayaz was a very happy and friendly person who loved his sport and was extremely community-minded. He is deeply missed,"" Mr Chaudhry told AAP.

""It's been very important to help get his parents out to Australia, and his siblings will be watching the funeral virtually.""

656,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,6 months after cyclone Idai: farmers are fainting in fields because of hunger - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/6-months-after-cyclone-idai-farmers-are-fainting-fields-because-hunger,"Six months on from the devastation wreaked by Cyclone Idai in which more than 1,000 people were killed in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, hunger is escalating as the United Nation’s humanitarian response in Mozambique is less than half funded, warned Oxfam. Only 45% of Mozambique’s humanitarian appeal has been funded, while the number of people in need of food aid has risen by 25% since April 2019 – up from 1.6 million to 2 million as the impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth has been compounded by drought in the South and unrest in the North.

Farmers are fainting in the fields along the southern shore of the Buzi river because they have nothing to eat but tomato soup, one of the few fast-growing crops people could plant after the extensive flooding damaged their lands, wiped away their harvests and destroyed their seed stocks.

In dozens of resettled communities, relocated to mitigate the risk of future floods, people are not getting enough food and with the lean season approaching, there will not be a harvest until next year.

Rotafina Donco, Oxfam Country Director in Mozambique, said: “Things are taking an ominous turn, regardless of our efforts to provide resettled communities with essential aid: women are skipping meals so that the little food there is can be given to children. Families are foraging for wild plants as there’s not enough or very little to eat. Hunger risks becoming the silent killer of those who survived Idai.”

10 per cent of Mozambique’s population is now in need of food assistance and levels of food insecurity are rising to crisis threshold in hard to reach areas in Sofala, Zambezia, Manica and Tete provinces, affected by Idai, as well as Cabo Delgado where Kenneth struck.

“Today, the emergency phase ought to be over but those who survived Idai are on the brink of a food insecurity crisis” says Donco. “Despite sustained aid efforts, the demand is outstripping supply: entire communities in Buzi district are facing shortages of food, clean water, shelter and access to livelihoods.”

Food insecurity is hitting women hardest, as even before the cyclone, poverty rates in the areas affected by Idai were higher than the national average, and the lack of recovery risks pushing them even deeper into deprivation. Aid donors and the government must prioritise the needs of women and girls.

José Mucote, Director of AJOAGO, said: “We were still grappling with a biting drought in the South, when Cyclone Idai and the floods struck central Mozambique. Each disaster is making people poorer by the day and more vulnerable to whatever may come next. Every day we’re supporting people who were already living in extreme poverty and had coped with a more and more crises over the past two decades.”

The Sofala region in central Mozambique was heavily hit by the Cyclone and flooding which, partially or totally, destroyed lands and crops of over 433,056 families. In dozens of displaced peoples’ sites where entire communities were relocated to mitigate the risk of future floods, thousands of people are relying on aid to survive. The lean season is now approaching, and the next harvest will only be ready by March/April 2020: until then, almost 2 million people will remain at risk of food insecurity.

As the intensity and frequency of natural hazards has increased because of the climate crisis, the people of Mozambique are left wondering whether the next rainy season will bring more flooding or another drought and how they can ensure the safety of their families and protect their livelihoods.

Notes to editors

In response to Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, COSACA humanitarian consortium consisting of Oxfam in Mozambique, Save the Children International and Care International have to date reached over 600,000 people in Sofala, Manica, Tete, Zambezia, and Cabo Delgado provinces. COSACA response teams are ensuring the needs of women and girls are prioritised in the areas of nutrition and livelihoods, health, shelter, water and sanitation, child protection and education.

According to the revised UN Humanitarian Response Plan, which was released this week [12 September] 2.6m people still need humanitarian assistance in Mozambique and in particular 2m people are food insecure after Cyclones Idai and Kenneth. The figures are an increase from the previous Plan, released in March, which reported 1.6m facing food insecurity. In addition to the cyclones and floods, the analysis takes into account drought in the south and growing insecurity in the north of the country.

462,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"As tensions rise with Russia, U.S. colleges still pay for Snowden speeches - Yahoo Finance",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snowden-paid-speeches-colleges-amid-russia-tensions-103054930.html,"A poster for the Ohio State University event.

Last November, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden was beamed in from somewhere in Russia to address a crowd of Ohio State University students.

“Democracy only works for all of us when we all work to uphold the system,” Snowden, appearing on a giant video screen, told the sold-out crowd of about 1,700. “The letters of the constitution are not going to jump off the page and protect your rights. People give those letters strength.”

The university paid $30,000 through an American speakers’ bureau to digitally host Snowden, one of his largest known contracts to date, according to documents obtained by Yahoo Finance. The Ohio State event was one of a series of speeches that have netted Snowden — who is still a fugitive in the eyes of the U.S. government — well over $200,000 in the past two years, as Yahoo News first reported last year. He has continued to give paid speeches, including at U.S. colleges, in 2017.

The ongoing speaking contracts come at a time when Snowden’s fate and influence are more uncertain than ever. A campaign by Snowden’s supporters to win him a pardon was rebuffed by the outgoing Obama White House, and new President Donald Trump previously labeled him a “terrible traitor.”

Moreover, Snowden’s efforts to present himself as an Internet privacy pioneer are now complicated by an American political environment colored by increasing wariness and hostility toward Snowden’s host since June 2013: Russian President Vladimir Putin.

‘It definitely looks bad’

In January, U.S. intelligence agencies publicly asserted that the Kremlin executed an elaborate influence campaign aimed at hurting the candidacy of Putin foe Hillary Clinton and boosting the candidacy of Putin admirer Donald Trump. (U.S. agencies are also investigating contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials.)

“There is no question that there has been a dramatic shift in the surveillance debate in the U.S. since the Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election,” Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University, told Yahoo Finance in an email.

Story continues

EPIC is currently attempting to compel the office of the director of national intelligence to release its complete assessment on Russia’s election interference. Rotenberg noted that the debate ignited by Snowden’s advocacy has given way to considerations of Russian meddling.

“Snowden raised important questions about the scope of U.S. government surveillance,” Rotenberg said. “And his efforts led to reforms, including passage of the Freedom Act. And he continues to make good arguments for legal control of surveillance authority. But now the focus is on understanding and preventing cyberattacks on democratic institutions. Without democratic institutions, it is not possible to enforce the rule of law.”

Snowden’s speaking events highlight his peculiar situation as a 33-year-old former U.S. intelligence contractor being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars from speaking contracts — some from public American colleges — while living under guard at an undisclosed location in the territory of a resurgent adversary.

“It definitely looks bad that he’s over there in Russia,” Chris Weber, a cybersecurity expert who co-authored the 2002 book Privacy Defended and supports more transparency about government surveillance, told Yahoo Finance. “It could be damaging to privacy advocates and to all of the progress that has been made since his original revelations, because he is still in Russia and there’s a lot of tension.”

Weber, who has been writing about U.S. government surveillance since before the 2001 passage of the Patriot Act, which expanded the government’s authority to conduct the kind of surveillance Snowden exposed, noted that it’s reasonable to wonder whether Snowden could be manipulated as part of a larger game.

“He turned the lens around for a brief period so that we could look in the mirror,” Weber said. “Now that lens has been turned back around,” Weber added, noting that Snowden’s mysterious living situation “kind of invalidates things for a lot of people.”

‘Foreign interference is a common thing’

Snowden, for his part, has given mixed messages about his view of political tensions between Moscow and Washington.

He has sometimes been publicly critical of the Kremlin’s invasions of Internet privacy and its crackdowns on dissidents through tweets sent out to more than 3 million Twitter followers. Snowden and his supporters contend that these comments show he is not a Russian tool, as some critics claim.

But he has also downplayed Russia’s election meddling, taking a “so-what-if-they-did” attitude toward the Russian activities.

“All countries are doing this,” Snowden told the CeBIT technology conference in Germany on March 21. “The Russians are interfering in our elections. The Chinese are interfering in our elections. The Germans are interfering in our elections! In a very light, very polite way in their case. … Foreign interference is a common thing.”

Snowden later asked: “If elections have been interfered with throughout history, why did it actually matter this time?”

Snowden’s CeBIT talk also included praise of WikiLeaks, which published emails during the US presidential campaign that were stolen by Russian hackers and published CIA hacking tools in early March 2017. Russian state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik used Snowden’s comments to argue that the U.S. lacked evidence of Russian election tampering and to promote WikiLeaks’ actions.

Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating the Russian activities connected to the election, called them an “assault on our democratic institutions.” The House intelligence committee released an unclassified report on Snowden in December that called him “a serial exaggerator and fabricator” and alleged: “Since Snowden’s arrival in Moscow, he has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services.”

On March 22, Snowden signaled support for claims by the Trump White House that incidental collection of Trump transition staffers’ communications amounted to spying by the U.S. government under former President Barack Obama. Ironically, one of Snowden’s tweets on the subject was retweeted by Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer.

‘Compelled to support his livelihood’

Ohio State University paid Gotham Artists $30,000 to host Snowden via video chat for 90 minutes on Nov. 30, 2016. Emails obtained by Yahoo Finance do not show exactly how the event came about.

The Ohio Union Activities Board “brainstorms ideas and receives suggested speakers, events and activities from a number of agencies that they work with regularly,” Ohio State Public Relations Director Benjamin Johnson told Yahoo Finance. “Our students became interested in Snowden in connection with the movie starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt.”

The money came from the student activity fee, a fund that charges $37.50 each semester to all undergraduate, graduate and professional students enrolled at Ohio State’s Columbus campus. At least one Ohio State student disagreed with the arrangement.

“What bothers me the most is having no choice but to be put in the unethical position of paying someone with … criminal charges pending against him,” fourth-year student Robin Smith wrote in a letter to the school paper. “OSU students, whether you agree or disagree with Snowden’s actions, we all have been compelled to support his livelihood.”

On June 14, 2013, Snowden was charged in a Justice Department criminal complaint with theft of government property and two violations of the U.S. Espionage Act for disclosing classified communications. Thus far, the U.S. has chosen to refrain from targeting his financial livelihood through actions such as sanctions by the U.S. Treasury, executive orders, or specific law enforcement mechanisms.

“It appears that so far the U.S. government’s approach has been one of diplomacy and a focus on extradition as opposed to traditional legal weapons that might be used against criminals in other cases,” Jonathan Schanzer, a former U.S. Treasury analyst and current vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Yahoo Finance.

‘Social engineering the next generation’

Snowden began speaking at U.S. colleges with a video chat at Harvard in January 2015. Promotional material from Open Mic Productions, an events production company that promotes Snowden speeches exclusively on YouTube and Twitter, touts the positive receptions he has received on college campuses.

“At campuses across North America, including Harvard, University of Chicago, McGill, University of Arizona, Columbia, University of Iowa, Stanford and others, he has received rave reviews and standing ovations,” the brochure states.

Snowden is the only speaker that Open Mic Productions lists as a client.

A person close to Snowden previously told Yahoo News last year that the American made more than $200,000 between September 2015 and August 2016 through digital appearances organized by the American Program Bureau. Three contracts during that time were signed with public U.S. colleges — the universities of Iowa, Colorado, and Arizona — totaling $79,000.

“There is nothing remotely improper about Edward Snowden making a living by speaking to global audiences about surveillance and democracy,” Snowden’s primary US lawyer Ben Wizner, who coordinates the appearances, told Yahoo last fall.

Jeremiah Talamantes, president of the cybersecurity company RedTeam Security, sees a clear strategy in Snowden speaking to colleges (beyond the lucrative contracts).

“There’s a reason he’s speaking at universities,” Talamantes told Yahoo Finance. “It’s almost as if … he’s social engineering the next generation.”

Talamantes, an expert on social engineering to target specific people with influence operations, said American students are an ideal audience for Snowden.

“Who are you targeting? … He’s talking to these very impressionable folks,” Talamantes said. “If I were to inspire a movement, the first place I would go to is universities and start from the grassroots. It’s pretty clear to me in terms of what he’s trying to do.”

So far in 2017, Snowden has spoken to three colleges — the University of Waterloo in Canada, the University of Pittsburgh, and Middlebury College in Vermont — in addition to addressing several tech conferences. Amid the geopolitical tensions, Snowden’s statements about U.S. surveillance are especially provocative to Washington.

“These programs were never about terrorism,” Snowden told Middlebury students on March 16, repeating a line he first used in December 2013, referring to the mass surveillance programs he exposed. “They are about economic espionage, diplomatic manipulation and social control. We should never permit them to say they are saving our lives if they can’t show evidence that they are.”

The University of Pittsburgh paid an unspecified amount to host Snowden, emphasizing that payment was “provided to the agency representing Snowden rather than directly to the speaker.” The Middlebury Student Government Association, which invited Snowden, told Yahoo Finance that the organization is “obligated by contract [to] not share any information about our agreement with Mr. Snowden.”

1103,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Why is Karachi drowning and could we have prevented it? - Euronews,https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/09/07/why-is-karachi-drowning-and-could-we-have-prevented-it-,"Anmol Irfan is a writer, feminist, and founder of Perspective Magazine. Here she shares her views on how the largest city in Pakistan should not have ignored warnings about the climate crisis.

Karachi is drowning.

Over the last week, torrential rains have ravaged Pakistans cosmopolitan hub. Breaking records of over 90 years, the city has been flooded as its systems and infrastructure find themselves unable to cope with the unprecedented amount of rainfall.

But how much does this have to do with climate change?

The citys inability to deal with rain isnt exactly a revelation - previous years have seen monsoon seasons cause substantial damage. But this year, its a crisis like never before. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has reported 63 deaths in rain related incidents already, while entire residential areas and markets have been submerged, causing millions of rupees worth of damage to houses and businesses.

The onslaught of such a disaster has come as a shock to locals who wonder why officials didnt put preventative measures in place, with full knowledge that the rainy season was coming.

Its not something thats happened recently. This has been 30-40 years in the making, explains Vice Chairman of the Lahore Development Authority, SM Imran. The neglect of Karachis development is cited as the main reason behind the citys current crisis. Despite the citys importance to Pakistans economy and development, sustainable growth of the city has never been a political priority, he adds.

As roads collapse and sewage systems overflow, questions are arising as to where years worth of taxpayers money has gone. Residents of various areas in the city are experiencing three-day long power shortages and stagnant water blocking the streets.

Did Karachi ignore the warnings?

Karachis situation is a glaring example of what can happen when climate change warnings and sustainable growth are neglected - in favour of political optics and superficial development.

In a country that has faced significant damage in the past due to droughts, this influx of rain could have been a game changer. But instead, a lack of preparation has turned what should have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster.

To make matters worse, the drainage system which collapsed in DHA, supposedly the posh area of the city, was built in 2007 and residents were charged for it.

A lack of preparation has turned what could have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster

Moving forward, it is imperative we understand exactly where the problem lies. The lost lives and flooding are horrific enough - but the damage they have caused may not be fixed for years to come.

Pakistans already debt-ridden economy will now have to face the harrowing consequences of redoing entire sewage systems, rehabilitating thousands of people and businesses and possibly risk losing their main port city.

How will the city recover?

This years disaster has proven that there is no time to be lost. Priorities need to be set in order for changes to be made. Instead of focusing on other aspects of infrastructure that contribute very little to the citys growth, Imran believes the focus now needs to be on water conservation and treatment.

For Imran, Israel is a good example we can learn from. Its Ashkelon facility provided for 70 per cent of the countrys water demands through a process of seawater desalination. A city that craved rainfall is now richer in water resources. This just shows that we can harness the effects of climate change in our favour, if we know how to. Whats needed now is a complete overhaul of what we thought our future would be, explains Imran.

Karachi has been labelled resilient many times over the years. But as the city descends into worse conditions, its resilience is no longer a compliment but an excuse. No longer can this idea of resilience be used to ignore its exacerbating problems.

One possible solution is for local governments to do more than just pass bills. Many now believe that programmes should be put in place to teach employees how best to reuse water and treat rubbish.

Currently though, political solutions seem too little too late, and citizens are stepping up to rehabilitate the city themselves.

Citizens are coming to the rescue

Among the many initiatives taken over by relief workers and organisations, is Saturday Welfare Group (SWG). What started as a group of friends wanting to provide rehabilitation to marginalised communities in Pakistan has grown into a powerful initiative that steps up in times of crisis.

Everyone is equal who is contributing to or working for welfare, is their motto.

It's a motto that couldnt be more fitting with the situation Karachi now finds itself in. Both within the country and among the Pakistani diaspora, fundraising is at an all-time high. Its a testament to the idea that there are people who want change, and are ready to work for it - they just need an opportunity. Development in Karachi should be carried out on a much more equal scale, and perhaps those truly working for change will finally get the attention they deserve.

Recovery will be a long road, and hopefully when political action begins to reflect the needs of the hour, it will be up to residents to play their role as well. Pollution and littering is a major problem the city struggles with. As trash from the streets finds its way into drainage pipes, it blocks the very waterways that are meant to save the city from such disasters. Conservation initiatives need to be better understood.

This is a responsibility that lies with the educated strata of society, who have the power and resources to implement these initiatives and make them accessible to the masses. Feigning ignorance over harmful habits and actions is no longer a valid excuse.",2020-09-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['development', 'political', 'city', 'climate', 'change', 'water', 'damage', 'worth', 'drowning', 'karachi', 'prevented', 'citys']",Pakistan,news article,English

The storm also set off landslides and knocked out power lines, leaving 1.7 million people in the dark.



Storm Molave, the ninth storm this year in the South China Sea and the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years, struck coastal provinces on Oct. 28 with heavy rainfall and winds as high as 115-135 km per hour, according to data provided by Vietnams National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting on Wednesday.



Landslides in central provinces have killed at least 19 people and buried more than 40 others, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, adding that the bodies of 12 fishermen missing since the storm hit on Wednesday were recovered on Thursday, leaving another 14 still unaccounted for.



Around 56,000 houses were stripped of their roofs in Quang Ngai, where a massive blackout from downed power lines left more than a million people trapped in darkness as high winds tore through the province, according to state-controlled Vietnam News, AP said.



Wednesdays storm hit central regions already devastated by weeks of heavy rains, floods, and landslides beginning Oct. 6 that left at least 130 dead and thousands displaced. The floods and landslides also wrecked highways and roads, blocking efforts to rescue and bring supplies to many cut off from help in remote areas.



Speaking to RFA on Thursday, residents in storm-hit provinces described fast-rising waters and devastated fields, with one saying that floodwaters had risen more quickly now than they had during the storms that battered the area earlier this month.



During previous storms and floods, the water rose only to the height of my hand. But now the water rose so high that my house was submerged, Hien Thao, a resident of Quang Tri province, speaking to RFA on Oct. 29.



I lost 500 kg of paddy rice, and many of my household belongings were washed away, he said.



Yesterday, the water rose up to the yard of my house, added 40-year-old Phan Quoc Vu of Truong Xa commune in Cam Lo districts Cam Hieu village in Quang Tri. But luckily it began to recede today, he said.



In the opinion of my 80-year-old father, this was the worst storm flooding that he can remember, Vu said.



Calls for help



At the height of the flood, Vu called unsuccessfully to local authorities for help, and even posted calls for help on social media, but finally had to hire canoes to help evacuate elderly people and young children to safer ground, he said.



In Ninh Thuan province, villagers had made their living mainly through farming and raising shrimp, said Tran Thanh Truc, a resident of the provinces Hien Luong commune.



But the floodwaters washed everything awaypigs, chickens, and shrimp, she said. We are glad to receive whatever help others can give us, but it will be difficult to make up for everything that was lost.



In Quang Tri, supplies including large quantities of rice have been received so far only from volunteers, Hien Thao said, adding that the local Peoples Committee has promised to bring relief goods soon.



I also learned that the government will provide us with seeds for farming our next crop in the winter and spring.



We would like them to also give us boats and other equipment we need, along with rice that will help us while we wait for our next crop to be ready for harvest, he said.



In Truong Xa commune, officials have cared so far only for their own relatives, though, Pham Quoc Vu said.



They are not impartial, which is causing much suspicion, he said.



Heavy rains, flooding in Laos



In Laos, heavy rains and flooding from Wednesdays storm damaged or destroyed around 51,000 hectares of agricultural production, including more than 23,000 hectares of rice fields, across 13 districts of Savannakhet province, state media sources said on Friday.



Total losses in farm production and livestock from flooding in the storm are now estimated at 283 billion kip (U.S. $6,257,968.), Keoodom Souliyaan official from the provinces Agriculture and Forestry Departmentsaid on Thursday.



In the southern province of Champassak, strong winds toppled power lines, while in Borikhamxay province, Khamkeut districts Napae village was completely destroyed by floods, a video obtained by RFA showed on Friday, with a narrator on the video saying Napae had now become a sea of water.



The video also showed floods and landslides blocking the road leading from Napae to the Naphao International Border Checkpoint with Vietnam.



A rice paddy being harvested was also under water, Phetsamai Xayaathichak told local media. We will announce the exact amount of local damage later, once we know what it is, he said.



A total number of deaths in Laos resulting from the storm was not immediately available.

And to provide a taste of what’s to come in 2022, as well as unveiling the new brand and vision for the Games, a free community festival of sport, culture and food – the Commonwealth Social – will see thousands of residents coming together with Team England athletes, local business and community leaders, and Games representatives, to celebrate the countdown to the Games.

The event includes a series of live performances from regional dance and musical groups and the chance to try Commonwealth cuisine, thanks to local street food traders from Digbeth Dining Club. Budding young sports stars will also be given the opportunity to take part in demonstrations, receiving advice and encouragement from 15 Team England athletes, including five Commonwealth Gold medallists: boxer Galal Yafai, netballer Ama Abgeze, para athlete Katrina Hart and gymnasts Dominick Cunningham and Alice Kinsella.

In 2022 the Games will see 6,500 athletes from 71 different nations flocking to Birmingham and the West Midlands, to rewrite the region’s sporting history but Birmingham 2022 is already proving to be a catalyst for transformation across the West Midlands, attracting new investment and funding, creating jobs and apprenticeships for local people and new opportunities for local businesses, as well as accelerating projects that will ensure the region is ready to host a world-class celebration of elite sport and dynamic and innovative culture.

Ian Reid, Birmingham 2022 chief executive officer, said: “On this day, in three years’ time, millions of people from across the globe will join us in celebrating the opening of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, which is why it will provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to truly put this city and vibrant region on the map.

“The idea behind today’s Commonwealth Social event is that we wanted to celebrate this major milestone and to give people an indication of what to expect in three years’ time, when the eyes of the world will be focused on Birmingham and the West Midlands region.

“Just like the Games, sport is at the heart of today’s event, but Birmingham 2022 will also be a showcase for everything that’s great about this region; the culture, the food and, most importantly, the people that live here. We’re creating the Games for everyone and we’re already collaborating with local people to help make that vision a reality.”

The setting for today’s Commonwealth Social, Birmingham’s newly redeveloped Centenary Square, is just a stone’s throw from Arena Birmingham, the venue for gymnastics during the Games and local gymnast, Team England’s Dominick Cunningham, is delighted to be attending today’s festivities.

Dominick said: “It’s so exciting that it’s now three years to go until the Commonwealth Games come to Birmingham, my hometown. Competing for Team England in Australia last year was an amazing experience and to get to do that again in front of a home crowd full of all of my friends and family would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I’m not stopping now, I want that gold for Birmingham!”

With so many people gathering together, today’s Commonwealth Social was identified as the perfect opportunity to introduce the new Birmingham 2022 brand, which was co-created with people from the region through a series of roadshows, workshops, focus groups and conversations held last autumn and winter.

The brand connects key West Midlands destinations – many of which will host events during the Games – bringing their locations together to create a truly unique ‘B’ shaped design.

The new logo has in fact been the subject of speculation in the West Midlands this week, after a series of mysterious tape art installations appeared across the region without explanation, but today it was finally revealed that Birmingham 2022 was behind this artwork, after a giant installation at New Street Station was unveiled this morning.

Birmingham 2022 is already demonstrating its commitment to involving residents across the region in everything they do and its recent research project, Common Ground, has visited communities across the West Midlands, speaking to people about how they think the Games can transform the region and the lives of people that live here.

Local people will also feature in a new advertising campaign, launched today to raise awareness and excitement for the Games. The adverts put local people at the heart of Birmingham 2022 and will be appearing across the city and online.

Commonwealth Games Federation President Dame Louise Martin said: “With three years to go to the Opening Ceremony of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, the excitement is already palpable.

“Preparations are well underway for the delivery of a spectacular multi-sport event for the people of Birmingham, the West Midlands, England and the Commonwealth.

“Launching the new brand on this special day will also ensure the identity of Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games lasts forever.

“I do hope that everyone who is able will join in the celebrations at the Commonwealth Social in Birmingham’s iconic Centenary Square. Enjoy!”

Nicky Morgan MP, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said:

“With three years to go until Birmingham 2022, this event marks an important milestone in the lead up to what will be a fantastic Games.

“It is great to see people are coming together to celebrate this moment. Harnessing this kind of strong community spirit will help us showcase the best of Birmingham, the West Midlands and our entire country when we welcome our friends from across the Commonwealth to the Games.”

Cllr Ian Ward, Leader of Birmingham City Council, said: “With just three years to go, we are at the point when everything about the Commonwealth Games is becoming much more tangible.

“The council-led projects that are enabling the Games, including the development of the Commonwealth Games Village and refurbishment of the Alexander Stadium, are progressing on budget and on schedule, with activity set to significantly increase in the coming months.

“Enthusiasm and interest in Birmingham 2022 is bubbling and will continue to grow as we get even closer to the staging of the biggest event in the city’s history and the long-term benefits the city and its people will gain in the years to come.”

About the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games

The Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, which will be held from 27 July until 7 August 2022, will be a once in a lifetime opportunity to put the city, the region and its people on the global stage.

The Games is already proving to be a catalyst for transformation across the West Midlands, attracting new investment and funding, creating jobs and apprenticeships for local people and new opportunities for local businesses, as well as accelerating projects that will ensure the region is ready to host a fantastic sports and cultural celebration.

Planned housing and transport schemes have been brought forward and will happen sooner as a result of the Games, with 1,400 new homes being built in Perry Barr. Initially, these will be the Athletes’ Village but are then part of a wider regeneration plan for the whole area.

The Alexander Stadium will also be overhauled, whilst a new Aquatics Centre in Sandwell will be built for the Games.

Birmingham 2022 will be the Games for everyone, bringing people together from across Birmingham and the region, to provide a warm welcome to its millions of visitors during the summer of 2022. Find out more at www.birmingham2022.com

749,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Residents of flood-ravaged Wharton County feel forgotten in Harvey's wake - Houston Chronicle,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Residents-of-flood-ravaged-Wharton-County-feel-12199385.php,"WHARTON - Kenneth Pospisil saw the flood coming in the city of Wharton, while he and his neighbors grilled ribs on their Freedom Road lawn.

Sharon Thyssen noticed it in the town of Glen Flora, where she'd planned to celebrate her 62nd birthday with her husband and friends.

Linda Holmes spotted it in her country home, when she looked out a window and saw her yard shining.

For residents of rural Wharton County, located some 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston, the floodwaters came quickly - in a matter of hours, perhaps faster. They arrived as a wall of water, pushing across fields, over roads and up to doorsteps.

The flooding caused by the Colorado River surging far beyond its banks would cause damage that would leave the area forever changed, even as the nation's eyes remained fixed on the devastation in Houston.

Outside of Wharton, no one seemed to notice the force that residents of this rural community struggled against.

""We feel like we're the forgotten city,"" Wharton City Secretary Paula Favors said.

Four days after Harvey made landfall on Aug. 25, the rising river took thousands by surprise as it swamped neighborhood after neighborhood in a string of towns and into the city of Wharton.

It stayed high for days, flooding more than one in three homes in the county seat. People likened it to a war zone. The floods affected more homes around it.

The county of some 42,000 saw the bulk of the damage in its eastern half, where much was affected, the emergency management coordinator said. A tally of the damage has not yet been completed.

Residents recalled it the same way. Until that moment, they considered themselves safe. Then they had no time to think. Some fled. Some stayed put. Some found themselves forced onto rooftops or into attics.

But they saw water and knew it was time to go - or figure out how to stay and survive.

***

Just as Houston planners knew to watch certain spots after Hurricane Harvey swept through, emergency management officials in outlying counties knew to watch the rivers. They knew how ferocious they could become.

In Fort Bend and Brazoria counties, the Brazos River threatened levee systems. In the Tierra Grande subdivision, the San Bernard River put numerous homes at risk.

Wharton County residents had the Colorado and San Bernard rivers with which to contend. The former had caused issues before, repeatedly flooding the historically black section of the city of Wharton in recent years.

Before Harvey struck, Wharton County Emergency Management Coordinator Andy Kirkland asked around about other past floods. He expected the river this time, as previously, to connect with and fill other waterways around the city. But he didn't predict that it would hit with such force.

""We were not expecting that water to come rolling across the prairie,"" Kirkland said. ""We did not know that it would be of the magnitude that it was.""

The city began with a voluntary evacuation, said Favors, the city secretary. Then the unthinkable happened: Water entered her 1880s-era home in Egypt, a town upriver from Wharton and 11 miles west. Water hadn't gotten into that house since 1913. Favors knew things would be bad.

She was right. By the time the river would crest, the city would be nearly boxed in by water. Emergency Medical Services would be flying people out in helicopters. The EMS director would lose his own home.

Fuel would run low. So would groceries.

The already-saturated ground would have an impact on water rising faster, said Katie Landry-Guyton, senior service hydrologist for the National Weather Service. Rain had fallen constantly, and in great amounts, both locally and upstream.

It would become critical how people communicated, said John Hofmann, executive vice president of water at the Lower Colorado River Authority, which provides a service to help keep people informed.

That became the first challenge. The radio station isn't based in their town. The newspaper prints only a few days a week.

It was hard to believe what was coming.

Aug. 29, 4:37 p.m.

TO GLEN FLORA RESIDENTS: PLEASE LEAVE THE AREA ASAP. FM 102 IS EXPECTED TO BE CLOSED WITHIN THE HOUR.

- Wharton County Office of Emergency Management Facebook post

For 34 years, Sharon and Michael Thyssen had lived in their storybook purple home in Glen Flora. They loved the precious town. Made up of roughly a dozen streets, it was home to artists, the elderly and farmers, they said. Michael, 64, was the town barber.

The Thyssens knew the river was rising. On Tuesday afternoon, they decided to take some documents to a safe place - just in case. They saw the water coming across the corn field in the distance.

Forty-five minutes later, the couple returned, expecting to join neighbors to celebrate Sharon's 62nd birthday. Water now was up to their ankles. There would be no birthday supper.

They fled with water lapping at their shins.

""It was just a shock to everybody,"" Sharon said.

Down the street, Trish Winkles felt like she was living in a nightmare. She had numerous rescue animals that she could not leave.

Winkles herded dogs into crates on the porch. She ushered cats inside. She watched, panicked, as the water began to rush past her house like Niagara Falls.

Her legs would ache for days from the effort of trying to walk through the torrent that defied prediction.

""Everybody was caught off guard,"" said Winkles, 63. ""This was like nothing anybody had ever experienced before.""

Flooding here was wreaking havoc, and still Houston remained the focus of the news, noted her neighbor, Roy Freese, 66.

Along with many other properties, the Thyssens' home flooded. So did the post office and Winkles' antique shop, one of the only businesses still open in town.

Winkles would have trouble calming her mind in the weeks that followed. The tears would keep coming.

""It's never going to be the same now,"" said Freese, who works in real estate.

He stood on the wraparound porch of his home, picturesque except for the step still caked in dirt.

Aug. 29, 10:44 p.m.

URGENT MESSAGE FOR RESIDENTS OF THE ORCHARD OR PEACH CREEK ACRES: If you live in these areas you should be leaving immediately and seeking shelter elsewhere.

Linda Holmes flicked off her TV. The network had changed from constant news to regular programming. ""I guess we're done,"" Holmes recalled thinking.

That's when she saw her lawn shining with water.

Here, in the unincorporated county, Holmes and her husband had retired 10 years prior. It felt like the country. They had a horse.

Holmes woke up her husband. Already, the water seemed too deep to leave safely.

Water seeped through the floors. It didn't stop rising. Finally, Homes concluded, they had to get in the attic.

The 71-year-old turned on all the lights in the house to signal their location. She called her daughter in California. She hung up quickly to conserve power.

Her son-in-law contacted law enforcement. No one could come rescue them until morning. Holmes prayed.

""I thought we were going to drown,"" Holmes said.

Time and again, Holmes climbed down the ladder to look and listen. But a boat didn't arrive until daylight. She is 5-foot-4, and, by then, the water came up to her chin. It would be days before Holmes could return. She watched for any news of her home. But she saw none on TV. It was only ""Houston, Houston, Houston,"" she said.

Water did reach the ceiling. It ruined everything. Her mother's Bible. The ""final furniture,"" as she'd put it, referring to fancy leather sofas they'd recently bought. All her clothes, save the red shirt she had worn since her rescue.

She hadn't died, but in a way it felt like she had.

Community members rallied together.

""That's how we survived,"" she said.

Aug. 30, 3:22 p.m.

We have reports that the water from the Bauman (sic) Slough and Peach Creek is entering the north side of Wharton ... Please be careful and be aware of this situation.

It was early afternoon and Kenneth Pospisil, 54, had just returned from helping to rescue someone. They put some of the evacuated woman's baking supplies in their freezers but had two slabs of ribs that wouldn't fit. So they decided to cook them.

Pospisil had raised a family in this one-story Wharton home with a sweeping lawn. His 29-year-old daughter, Annie Zimmerhanzel, and her husband, Cody, had come over with their 1-year-old and planned to stay for the storm. They expected it to be safer here than in their home a short drive away.

Then they noticed the water coming up the ditch, across the pastures. They grabbed medicine and clothes. In 15 minutes, water rushed over the driveway. They needed to go, even if the ribs weren't done cooking.

""We just left everything,"" Zimmerhanzel said.

At least 2 feet of water would enter the home. It would ruin her wedding dress, her baby books. Their possessions, like those of so many others, would end up in a soggy, stinky pile on the street.

Wharton is a place where relatives live across the street from one another. Some, like Zimmerhanzel, have known their neighbors their whole lives. Much of the city that was affected is low-income or working class.

Officials estimate roughly 1,300 of 3,200 homes in the city of Wharton suffered damage.

Across town, Juan Cantu and his family faced the same decision. They thought the storm was over, that they were safe. And then the road became a river.

""It was just unreal,"" said Cantu, 40. ""You can't believe it.""

They, too, left immediately and returned later to devastation. He still remembers how the family's house smelled when they first got to it, like sewage and crawfish. Now Cantu and his father sleep on mattresses in the gutted residence.

Across the street, a relative, Enedina Castellano, goes to her ruined home each day to wait for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. To fix the house, the 76-year-old worries she might need to use money she had set aside for her burial. She sat on a swinging bench in her driveway on Monday when the mail arrived. She checked to see if she'd gotten any bills.

She longed for more help to deal with the devastation.

""It was a lost town,"" she said. ""That's what they say.""",2017-09-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['wake', 'residents', 'holmes', 'floodravaged', 'county', 'wharton', 'water', 'saw', 'city', 'houston', 'town', 'harveys', 'river', 'knew', 'feel', 'forgotten']",Egypt,news article,English
208,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Australia floods: Couple’s house swept away on wedding day - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/australia-floods-new-south-wales-house-wedding-day-b1820282.html,"A young couple awoke on their wedding day to find their house had been swept away in the worst flooding Australia’s east coast has seen in 50 years.

Sarah Soars and Joshua Edge had reportedly been planning to get married outside their rented three-bedroom cottage in Mondrook, New South Wales, on Saturday.

But neighbours instead watched on in shock as the entire property was swept along the Manning River after it burst its banks.

Video footage shared on social media showed the cottage still fully intact as it floated down the river.

Fortunately, the couple were not inside at the time as they had been staying with family.

They had been renting the cottage from owners Peter Bowie and Tracia Milton, who were said to be “devastated” about losing the property, according to ABC News.

Mr Bowie told the broadcaster the young couple had planned to marry on the river bank in front of their home but were forced to call off the wedding as the weather worsened.

Residents in the area have banded together to help Mr Bowie and Ms Milton track down 180 of their cattle displaced during the downpours, ABC News added.

Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes along Australia’s east coast after heavy rains brought the worst flooding in half a century to some areas over the weekend.

New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian said the downpours across the state, Australia's most populous with eight million people, were worse than initially expected, especially for low-lying areas in Sydney's northwest.

“Yesterday, we were hoping it will only be a one-in-20-year event, now it looks like a one-in-50-year event,” she said during a televised briefing.

People in parts of Sydney's northwest were ordered to flee their houses in the middle of the night as fast-moving waters caused widespread destruction.

Late on Sunday, about another 1,000 people were asked to evacuate, after Ms Berejiklian said some 4,000 people may be asked to leave their houses.

Television and social media footage showed fast-moving water unmooring houses, engulfing roads, breaking trees and damaging road infrastructure.

Emergency services have estimated the total number of damaged houses to be “in the hundreds”.

Several major roads have been closed across the state while many schools have called off classes for Monday.

Prime minister Scott Morrison in a Facebook post announced federal financial assistance for those affected.

The flooding comes in stark contrast with the devastating bushfires that struck Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, when nearly seven per cent of NSW land was scorched.

Flooding risk and evacuation warnings were in place for about 13 areas in NSW, including the Hunter, one of Australia's major wine regions.

Several dams, including Warragamba, Sydney’s main water supply, spilled over causing river levels to surge.

Meteorologists said the downpour is set to continue for several days.

Emergency crews have responded to about 6,000 calls for help since the start of the rains on Thursday, including nearly 700 direct pleas for rescue from floods.

Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

On 13 October, the Government of Viet Nam released a call for emergency relief and support following four tropical cyclones and the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which combined have caused severe and widespread flooding, landslides, storm surge and strong winds since 6 October. As of 28 October, 214 people have reportedly been killed or are missing, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). An estimated 7.7 million people live in areas affected by flooding caused by the multiple storms, with some 1.5 million people in nine provinces directly affected and approximately 380,000 houses flooded, damaged or destroyed. Of those people directly affected by the current disaster, some 753,000 are women and girls, 134,000 are children under five, and 143,000 are over 65 years old.

On the morning of 11 October, Tropical Storm Linfa (Storm No. 6) made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in central Viet Nam, resulting in 150 to 300 mm of rain. This was followed on 14 October by Tropical Storm Nangka (Storm No. 7) which made landfall in northern Viet Nam, but also brought a further 150 mm of rain to the still flooded provinces of central Viet Nam. On 16 October, tropical depression INVEST 94W in the East Sea weakened into a low-pressure area and made landfall in the central provinces, and was subsequently followed by Tropical Storm Saudel (Storm No. 8) which made landfall in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces on 25 October. On 28 October, Tropical Cyclone Molave (Storm No. 9) made landfall in approximately the same area as Tropical Storm Linfa, with up to 700 mm of rain reported in Nghe An and Ha Thinh provinces and up to 400 mm of rain in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces.

In Quang Ngai province, some 17,000 people were evacuated because of the strong winds and rain. Between 5 and 20 October, VNDMA reported that many areas in central Viet Nam recorded a total rainfall of more than 2,400 mm, and in some locations, flood waters exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1979 and 1999.

As of 29 October, nine provinces have been affected by the cumulative impacts of the multiple storms including Tropical Cyclone Molave. These are, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Nghe An, Binh Dinh and Kon Tum provinces, with Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue provinces most severely affected.

Following Tropical Cyclone Molave, more than 88,000 houses and 50 schools had their roofs blown off, the majority in Quang Ngai province, and some 375,000 people were evacuated to evacuation centres. Those in the evacuation centres are amongst the most vulnerable having had their houses damaged or destroyed and having lost key household items in the floods. Many of the evacuation centres are overcrowded, do not have access to sufficient basic facilities such as water and sanitation, and health care, and lack appropriate management needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate protection risks especially for women and children.

As well as damage to houses, some 30,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged (including rice, other crops, and aquatic products) and more than 2 million cattle and poultry have been killed. This is likely to have severe impacts on food security and livelihoods, especially for those people who were already experiencing adverse economic impacts due to COVID19. Further, more than 360 schools have been flooded and damaged, with detrimental impacts on childrens ability to continue accessing education. In addition, more than 78 health centres and hospitals have also been damaged or flooded.

To date, the delivery of assistance has been hampered by extensive damage to public transportation infrastructure. VNDMA reports that more than 165 km of national highway, 140 km of local roads and three bridges have been heavily damaged. Rescue teams are accessing affected areas by boat to deliver relief items and to evacuate vulnerable people, prioritizing children, people with disabilities and elderly people. Communication has also been hampered by the loss of electricity in many affected areas.

The areas most severely affected by flooding are also those same provinces which experienced a second wave of COVID19 cases in July and August. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, a further thirty days of lockdown measures were implemented from 28 July to 5 September, with adverse socio-economic impacts for the region which already records higher than national average multidimensional poverty rates. As a consequence of COVID-19 related measures, the most vulnerable people had already had their coping capacities eroded prior to this current disaster and are thus in more acute need of immediate assistance to help them manage the current, compound crisis.

From 20 and 23 October, joint GovernmentUN-NGO assessments were undertaken in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai provinces. Key findings from the assessments include the need for emergency food assistance for 177,000 of the most vulnerable people, restoration of agricultural land, safe access to clean water and sanitation facilities including in health centres and schools, the provision of dignity kits for women and girls, provision of education supplies and alternative learning solutions to ensure continuity of learning, support for those people evacuated from their homes, repairs for damaged houses, replacement of basic household items, health support especially maternal and child health, risk communication activities, provision of micro nutrients and continuation of nutrition activities to prevent an increase in rates of malnutrition.

Protection has been identified as a key need in this response, including the immediate need to ensure protection and safeguards for women and children currently living in evacuation centres. Partners involved in the development of this plan have also highlighted the need to provide assistance in a gender-responsive manner that addresses the specific needs of women and girls. The Government has requested that all relief activities target the most vulnerable people, including poor, near poor, people living with disabilities, children, femaleheaded households and elderly people, which are the target populations for this response plan.",2020-10-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['plan', 'response', 'nam', 'quang', 'provinces', '2020', 'viet', 'tropical', 'floods', 'affected', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'assistance', 'storm', 'including']",Vietnam,news article,English

Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar said 143 people are still missing, a day after the glacier burst triggered a massive avalanche and floods in the Alaknanda river system.

The efforts are focussed at the moment on rescuing 30-35 people trapped in a 250-metre long tunnel at Tapovan, he said.

A total of “153 people were missing from the two hydel projects at Raini and Tapovan out of which 10 bodies have been recovered while 143 are still missing,” Kumar said.

The two hydel projects bore the brunt of the “one time “ mishap in which the Rishi Ganga hydel project at Raini was totally destroyed and the one at Tapovan suffered partial damage, he said.

Though all arrangements are in place there is no need for any heli rescue in the affected areas. Only two villages including Raini are cut off where essentials are being supplied, the DGP said. The sudden flood in the Dhauli Ganga, Rishi Ganga and Alaknanda rivers – all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga – triggered widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the high mountain areas.

Homes along the way were also swept away as the waters rushed down the mountain sides in a raging torrent.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) announced that 256 people were evacuated from the flash flood-stricken area in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT). The region of East Flores had been devastated by intensifying rainfall caused by the two tropical cyclone seeds forming nearby.

As of April 5, the agency said the hundreds of local residents were evacuated to two village halls in Nelemawangi and Nelelamadike.

“The East Flores BPBD announced that sea crossing endangers sailing activities due to rainfall, wind, and high tides. On another note the evacuation of victims who are buried under sludge are still hampered by the heavy equipment,” BNPB spokesperson Raditya Jati wrote in a statement on Monday, April 5.

He further explained that the Flores Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) recorded 24 people who are still missing and 44 deaths caused by the natural disaster in NTT. 17 houses were reportedly swept by the major flash flood, 60 buried under land, and 5 bridges were completely wiped out.

Nine villages in the East Nusa Tenggara were devastated by the intensifying weather which comprises Nelemadike, Nelemawangi (Ile Boleng district), Waiburak and Waiwerang sub-district (East Adonara), Oyang Barang and Pandai (Wotan Ulu Mado), and Duwanur, Waiwadan and Daniboa (West Adonara).

1141,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Uganda: Floods and Landslides - Jun 2019 - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2019-000067-uga,"The landslides in Bududa District were triggered by a heavy and continuous downpour experienced from the night of 4th June, 2019 until the morning of 5th June, 2019. The landslides hit several sub-counties with most affected being Buwali and Bukalasi/Bundesi, Bumayoka and parts of Bubiita in the lower stream being affected by flash floods. As a direct consequence of these heavy rains, a total of four (4) major landslides occurred in Bududa: one in Bumayoka subcounty, one in Bukalasi/ Bundesi and two in Buwali. The landslides caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons (13 males & 14 females) with all still admitted at Bududa Hospital. Amongst the injured, two (2) are children under 5 years (1 male and 1 female). First rapid assessments identified eighty (80) households as displaced (480 people), out of the 100 affected households and 669 people affected. In the neighbouring Sironko District, along the Mount Elgon slope, a devastating flood incident occurred in Buyobo Sub-County on 4th of June at around 4:00am. The continuous rains that started at 2:20am and continued consecutively for hours triggered flooding from uphill, which carried a huge mass of soil down the hills into river Bugibuni, prompting it to burst its banks and causing havoc to the communities downhill. The river carried massive water, logs of huge trees, soil debris down the slope and swept off houses and crops adjacent to it. The flash floods damaged houses of 111 households, with a population of 426 persons. Fortunately, no deaths were registered. Crops, merchandise, animals and properties worth millions of shillings were destroyed by the floodwaters. (IFRC, 24 Jun 2019)

Several landslides and floods across Bulambuli District (eastern Uganda) have resulted in 1 death and 19 missing. The most affected areas include Nabiwutulu, Gimadu Bugatiisa, and Buluganya Counties. The Uganda Red Cross Society is conducting an assessment to establish magnitude of the disaster and the needs of the people affected. Eastern Uganda was already affected by a series of landslides in early June this year, when at least 5 died. Moderate to locally heavy rain is forecast across most of Uganda on 2-3 September.

The government decided to grant VND500 billion ($21.52 million) to five central provinces worst hit by historic flooding for rescue and social welfare support.

The five provinces, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Nam, would receive VND100 billion each as part of the governments efforts to help local communities overcome the consequences of devastating floods, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh sait at a meeting in Quang Tri on Thursday morning.

The government also provided each of the five provinces with 1,000 tons of rice alongside medicine and antiseptic chemicals.

Senior Lieutenant General Le Chiem, Deputy Minister of National Defense, said the ministry has provided 22 tons of dried food to flooded provinces. For Quang Tri, military forces also provided seven motorboats, 36 generators and three water pumps for after-flood clean-up work along with 1,000 life jackets.

Chiem suggested local authorities distribute dried food to victims in flood-prone areas immediately and properly.

In the past, the defense ministry found ""some local leaders had given dried food to officials as gifts because it was delicious,"" Chiem said. ""The dried food is meant for flood victims. They are in need.""

Binh said damage caused by floods in Quang Tri was ""very huge,"" especially in the two mountainous districts of Huong Hoa and Dak Rong where infrastructure has been heavily affected.

Therefore, the government has granted an additional VND40 billion for these two districts to cope with the flood impacts.

Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said floodwater started receding gradually, so it is necessary to focus on relief for flood victims, from Quang Nam to Ha Tinh.

Many international organizations have pledged donations of cash and disaster relief to help central Vietnam.

For more than two weeks, the central region has been swept by historic flooding and deadly landslides that caused damage described by government officials as worst in five years.

At least 114 people in central Vietnam were killed by severe flooding and landslides and more than 170,000 houses in flood-prone Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces have been submerged, with many areas currently isolated.",2020-10-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['floodhit', 'dried', 'vietnam', 'binh', 'mln', 'quang', 'aid', 'provinces', '21', 'disaster', 'minister', 'central', 'grants', 'food', 'victims', 'support', 'tri', 'provided']",Vietnam,news article,English

What are shown in these photographs became a part of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York on Aug 22, 2011. The museum, which occupies seven stories below the ground at the World Trade Center site, is due to open in 2012, on the 11th anniversary of the attacks.

A fire helmet that belonged to Chief Joseph Pfeifer.

Joseph Pfiefer , the battalion chief of Engine 7, Ladder 1, was on a routine call in downtown Manhattan when he heard the roar of American Airlines Flight 11 passing overhead on course to the North Tower of the World Trade Center. His unit was one of the first to arrive at the scene, and he set up a command center in the North Tower's lobby. That day, he was being followed by two French filmmaker-brothers, Jules and Gedeon Naudet, and their footage from the scene shows Pfiefer's brother Kevin, also a firefighter in a different unit, preparing to head upstairs for the unfolding rescue mission. When the South Tower collapsed, Pfiefer radioed evacuation orders to his officers in the North Tower. Pfiefer, along with the rest of Ladder 1, survived that day. His brother did not.

A recovered FDNY Squad 252 helmet that belonged to deceased FDNY member, Kevin M. Prior.

Kevin Prior , a firefighter with Brooklyn's Squad 252, can be seen in video footage of the North Tower lobby recorded after the first plane hit, getting ready to go upstairs. Responding to a Mayday call sent out by fellow firefighters encountering breathing problems, he and five other members of the squad are thought to have been on a floor in the 20s when the tower collapsed. Prior's body was found three weeks after the attacks and buried on Long Island, but his mother was troubled that his helmet had not been returned to the family, and said as much in a television interview. An employee at the city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner happened to catch the broadcast, recognized Prior's squad and badge numbers, and hand-delivered the badly damaged helmet to his grateful family.

An NYPD Emergency Service Unit hardhat and folding shovel used on Sept 11, 2001 and during the clean-up period at ground zero, by police officer Kenny Winkler of NYPD ESU 1.

Kenneth Winkler was off-duty from a night shift as an officer with the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit, on the morning of the attacks. He nonetheless joined his colleagues on their vehicle and they raced toward the World Trade Center, and stayed in the vehicle outside to coordinate communications between different parts of the force. After the South Tower collapsed, he ordered everyone still inside the North Tower to leave. He had to abandon the vehicle after the North Tower collapsed, and set up a new command center nearby and continued to try and coordinate communications. Later, he would work on the pile during the rescue operation, wearing his NYPD hardhat and carrying his hand shovel, and returned periodically to the site during the following nine-month clean-up operation.

Shoes of survivor Roger Hawke during his evacuation from the 59th floor of the North Tower.

Roger Hawke worked at Sidley Austin, a law firm that had offices on the 57th through 59th floors of the North Tower. This was not the first attack on the World Trade Center he had lived through: He was there in 1993 too, when bombs exploded at the complex. Soon after the first plane crashed somewhere above him on 9/11, he made his way to one of the increasingly crowded and hot stairways. It took about 90 minutes to descend to safety. He headed on foot to the apartment of his daughter and son-in-law on the Upper East Side, arriving there caked in ash, leaving his dust-choked shoes at the door before entering. His 4-year-old granddaughter jumped into his arms but then recoiled at the smell of smoke permeating his clothes: ""Papi is on fire from the inside,"" she said.

A ""Little Red"" doll discovered by Brian Van Flandern on Sept 12, 2001.

Brian Van Flandern awoke in Queens on the morning of 9/11 to the news of a plane hitting the North Tower, and was determined to volunteer despite his emergency medical technician license having recently expired. After repeated failed attempts to enroll at several impromptu volunteer coordination centers that had sprung up around the city that day, he decided to head to the World Trade Center site and managed to get past a checkpoint to join other volunteers on what became known as ""the pile"". He spent 24 hours helping search for trapped and wounded survivors. Morale quickly flagged: He recalls only one successful rescue, in which a man was freed from a piece of steel piercing his ankle. Before leaving the site, he found a rag-doll in the rubble. At first, it seemed to be evidence of a child caught up in the attacks. He later learned it was one of several mascot dolls that sat together on the shelf in the offices of the Chances for Children charity on the 101st floor of the North Tower, other examples of which were found scattered far and wide across Lower Manhattan.

Blood-stained shoes worn by Linda Lopez as she was evacuated from the 97th floor of Tower 2 on Sept 11, 2001.

Linda Lopez was at work at the Fiduciary Trust Company on the South Tower's 97th floor when the first plane crashed into North Tower, sending a fireball past their window and radiating a heat that she said felt like being sunburned. There was quickly a sense of confusion: Was it a bomb? Were the rumors that it was a plane crash true? Should people in the South Tower ignore the advice coming over the public address system to stay put and evacuate instead? Lopez felt she had to get out. She had reached only as far as the 61st when she was thrown against a wall as the second plane crashed into the floors above her. Taking off her shoes, she continued to head down the stairs, passing firefighters heading in the opposite direction. She ran barefoot out of the building, across broken glass and other debris. ""Lady, your feet are bleeding,"" someone said to her as she paused a few blocks away in relative safety. She put her shoes back on, and began learning the details of what it was she had just escaped from.

Ironworker construction helmet belonging to Larry Keating.

Larry Keating was an ironworker foreman who helped oversee the removal of wreckage from the World Trade Center site during the nine-month clean-up operation following the attack, and was chosen by the ironworkers union, Local 40, to represent his colleagues at the ceremonial removing of what became known as Last Column - an upright piece of the towers that had become covered in mementos from the clean-up workers and from which flew an American flag. He wore his hardhat throughout the clean up, and continued to wear it proudly for site visits until his death in 2011 from a heart attack.

A Port Authority Police Department uniform hat, badge number 899, and Port Authority Pipe Band hat belonging to victim Liam Callahan.

Liam Callahan was a Port Authority police officer who had been commended for his ""heroic actions"" after responding to the 1993 World Trade Center bomb attack, and was a first responder on the morning of 9/11. Even after the towers collapsed, Joan, his wife, continued to hope he might somehow turn up in time for the celebration of their 20th wedding anniversary the next day. He was killed at the age of 44. His family donated his Port Authority police uniform hat and the uniform he would wear as a drum sergeant in the force's Emerald Society Pipes and Drums band.

A red wallet belonging to victim Gennie Gambale, recovered from the rooftop of the Marriott Hotel at the World Trade Center.

Gennie Gambale was a vice president at Cantor Fitzgerald and was working on the 103rd floor of the North Tower when the first plane crashed into the lower floors, trapping those above. Her family put up thousands of posters around town in the hopes that she might be found alive, but it was in vain; she was 27 when she was killed. A police officer, who happened to be the mother of one of Gambale's friends, found Gambale's wallet on the roof of the nearby Marriott hotel and immediately recognized the name on the damaged cards inside, and ensured it was quickly handed over to the family.

Shoes worn by Florence Jones on Sept 11, 2001 as she escaped from the World Trade Center.

Florence Jones was still in her office at Baseline Financial on the South Tower's 77th floor when the second plane crashed into the building just one floor above. She and several colleagues tried two stairwells before finding their way to stairwell A, the only one not damaged by the crash. She took off her high-heeled shoes to hasten her descent - her boss carried them down for her. They were among the last to make it out of the tower before it collapsed.

Appeal amount: $500,000

SITUATION

Kenyaâ??s rainy season is from October through December. While the rains can improve pasture conditions in arid or semi-arid regions and recharge water systems, heavy storms and resulting flooding have also been devastating. Flash floods and overflowing rivers have affected at least 31 of Kenyaâ??s 47 counties, and some have experienced landslides or mudslides. On November 22, extreme rainfall struck parts of northern, western, central and coastal Kenya. That night, huge landslides and mudslides devastated parts of West Pokot County. The slides killed residents and destroyed homes and livelihoods.

According to the Kenya Red Cross Society, approximately 160,000 people have been affected by floods and/or slides as a result of heavy rainfall across the country, including 18,000 people who have been displaced. Following deadly landslides in West Pokot County in late November, Al Jazeera reported that, â??In Kenya, East Africaâ??s economic hub, the government said 120 people have been killed in flooding and mudslides during an unusually severe rainy season. More than 60 died over the weekend in West Pokot County. Tens of thousands of people across the country have been displaced, while infrastructure has been damaged, making aid delivery more difficult.â? According to the Kenyan government, of those 120 reported deaths, 72 were people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County. An estimated 11,000 people are now living in camps for displaced people in West Pokot County.

Heavy rains also affected Tana River County on November 22 and 23 and caused widespread flooding. The Tana River burst its banks as its water level rose quickly. Roughly 4,900 households have been affected by floods, conflict and drought in Tana River Sub-county and need food, shelter, water, health and livelihood support. Two thousand households urgently require shelter support, based on the CWS assessment in the region.

These floods are a horrific reminder of the effects of climate change. The same communities that are now coping with floods were facing severe drought just a few months ago and are among the most marginalized and impoverished in Kenya.

CWS Response

The Kenyan national and county governments are conducting search and rescue efforts and providing emergency supplies and officially designated evacuation shelters, but gaps remain in the relief effort. These gaps include shelter, food, clean water, safe sanitation, bedding, mosquito nets, medical supplies, kitchen supplies and psychosocial support.

CWS will respond in West Pokot and Tana River Counties alongside our partners. We work with Yangâ??at in West Pokot County and the Angelical Church and ADS Coastal Region in Tana River County. Our response will be collaborative within the ACT Alliance Forum Kenya and with the National Drought Management Authority and county governments.

A CWS team has completed a rapid assessment and identified the following priority needs:

Psychosocial support: counseling Clothing: warm clothes and sanitary items for women Bedding: blankets and mattresses Health: mosquito nets and water treatment tabs Food and nutrition: whole meals for children and rations for adults Other: utensils and water containers for displaced people

Regarding recovery, three priorities have emerged:

Shelter: iron sheets and roofing materials Farming restoration: irrigation systems, water pipes, farm tools and seeds Livelihood restoration: cash transfers

The CWS response is planned to reach 1,000 households in West Pokot County and 1,000 households in Tana River County.

First, we will identify the households and then purchase and distribute supplies based on specific needs. The focus will be on household items, food aid and aqua tabs for water treatment.

As the response turns to recovery and families return home, we will help them obtain iron sheets to repair roofs. When floods subside and farmers and fishers work to repair or replace damaged equipment, we will help them restart their livelihoods, including by providing seeds and agriculture tools. Communities will need to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure such as water sources and access paths, so we will look to use a cash for work system to help affected households while adding income flow into affected communities.

Throughout all these efforts, community involvement and stakeholder engagement will remain a priority. We will consistently engage with national and county government coordination committees and the ACT Alliance Kenyan Forum. We will capture lessons learned in order to help us improve future responses.

Budget

Emergency Response: $228,100

Recovery and Restoration: $193,000

Volunteer Management & Supply Distribution: $25,900

Capturing Lessons Learned: $3,000

CWS Response Coordinator / Coordination / Indirect Costs: $50,000

Rivers in the Brazilian Amazon region have risen to near record levels after heavy rains, flooding small towns and threatening areas hit hard by Covid-19 with another disaster.

In Amazonas state, 52 of the 62 towns and cities have areas under water, and 25 have declared a state of emergency including the capital, Manaus. About 410,000 people have been affected, according to the civil defence service.

In Manaus, the Negro river is at its third-highest level since records began in 1920, at 29.72m (97ft). Brazil's geological service expects the waters to reach 30.35m, exceeding the record flooding seen in 2012.

Raised wooden walkways for pedestrians have been erected in parts of the city centre, and local officials say they will set up barricades with sand bags to try to contain the waters. The houses of 4,200 people have been flooded across the capital.

The increased precipitation in the region is linked to La Niña, a phenomenon where cooler-than-normal surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean lead to significant weather changes in different parts of the world.

The town of Anamã, with a population of 12,700, has been totally flooded by the Solimões river. Boats and canoes have become the only way to get around the so-called ""Venice of Amazonas"".

Like most residents, Manoel de Oliveira Cardoso and his wife, Eliana dos Santos Madi, have built wooden structures so they can walk around the flooded rooms of their house.

""Look at the state of my house, half flooded, I've got nowhere to keep my things,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I'm struggling to see if I can salvage at least half of my things.""

As Anamã experiences inundations almost every year, some of the houses have a second level where people move their belongings in case of severe flooding. Others are built on wooden poles to keep them above the river level, known locally as palafitas.

The Solimões and Negro rivers are the main branches of the Amazon river, which has flooded the towns of Parintins and Itacoatiara. In Manacapuru, crops were destroyed.

Story continues

Meanwhile, cases and deaths related to Covid-19 were rising again in the state amid a slow rollout of vaccines and lack of co-ordinated measures to curb the spread of the virus, according to the Fiocruz Amazonas institute.

By boat, Neuda Sousa, a local health worker, carried a box of Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs to vaccinate residents in flooded areas.

Manaus and nearby areas reported the first cases of a highly contagious variant of Covid-19 that has spread throughout Brazil, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. Earlier this year, the city's health system collapsed, with hospitals running out of oxygen amid a steep rise in infections.

There are now fears Amazonas state could face a devastating third wave.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with reporter Laura Chung of the Sydney Morning Herald on how eastern Australia is coping with the worst flooding in decades less than two years after devastating bush fires.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Less than two years after bushfires blazed across Australia, the country's east coast is seeing its worst flooding in decades. Some areas accumulated over a yard of rainfall since downpours started last Thursday. Tens of thousands have been ordered to evacuate. On Sunday alone, 500 gigaliters of water, the same volume of water in Sydney Harbor - spilled out of Sydney's largest dam. Even as rain subsides, the floodwater will still pose trouble for weeks to come. We're joined now by Laura Chung, who has been reporting on all of this for the Sydney Morning Herald.

Welcome.

LAURA CHUNG: Thank you for having me.

CHANG: Thank you for being with us. So what are you hearing from people on the ground there? Can you talk about the scope of the damage that they've seen so far?

CHUNG: Of course. So unlike the bushfires, we don't actually have a clear image of how much has just been damaged and destroyed. We know it's a significant part of the state. But what we do know is there has been water everywhere. We've heard and seen houses just being picked up and floating down rivers that used to be farms and paddocks. We've heard of livestock just being completely washed away. There are videos of cows and horses just trying to make it through these really heavy floodwaters. And what used to be streets and paddocks are just now, yeah, completely flooded with water right up to where the power lines are.

CHANG: Wow.

CHUNG: So if you can imagine that, it is a very striking image.

CHANG: What about people who didn't or weren't able to evacuate and are now stranded? I mean, how are rescue operations going right now?

CHUNG: For a lot of people who live in these low-lying plains, floods aren't anything new to them. They've lived with them before. They know how to prepare for them. But there are a lot of people who were just not quite ready for how quickly the water would come up. So we've got thousands of volunteers from the State Emergency Service who are out there along with police and interstate help as well, who are rescuing people in boats. We've also seen helicopters being deployed to try and airlift people out of certain areas. And you know, not only are volunteers having to deal with the really intense flooding conditions. They're also having to deal with the wildlife that's coming their way as well. So there's this story of these volunteers who were rescuing this family, trekking over several kilometers to get to the family. And as they're returning, they got a message over the radio that they have to be aware of snakes. And they reported snakes kind of shimmying up the side of the boat and taking refuge with them just to...

CHANG: Oh, goodness.

CHUNG: ...Get out of that floodwater.

CHANG: Well, Laura, we spoke to you back in December 2019 when the bushfires were spreading across the area. And I'm curious - how do you think recovery from that disaster has affected recovery from this disaster? I mean, we're talking about communities that were just starting to rebuild, right?

CHUNG: Exactly. And they've gone through the bushfires and then - last year - and then immediately after that, there was a first round of floods, and then they were hit by the pandemic and now these floods again. So it's just been crisis after crisis and compounding their loss. Now, one farmer I spoke to had gone through, you know, all these crises. And he said, you know, what the fires didn't take, the floods have taken. And this sentiment has been repeated to me by so many people in that they've already suffered so many losses that this time around, they don't really have anything else to lose. There is this sense of, what next? You know, it's just hit us again and again and again.

CHANG: Well, I understand that much of the rain has dissipated now. Can I just ask you, what is it like to finally see some blue skies and some sunshine where you are right now?

CHUNG: It is a very welcome sight (laughter) - a very strange sight after about seven days of rain.

CHANG: Yeah.

CHUNG: But I think the message that we've constantly heard is the danger is not over. For many people, the flood and the cleanup has only just started. And many residents are saying, well, yes, while we've survived the floods, we've got months of trying to get our lives back on track.

CHANG: Laura Chung of the Sydney Morning Herald, thank you so much for your reporting. And stay safe.

CHUNG: Thank you for having me.

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, February 8

The Uttarakhand tragedy has put a question mark on what actually led to the disaster. While some environmentalists are questioning claims of “a glacier burst”, others are pointing to long-standing struggle of locals against massive construction activities, including highways and hydropower projects such as Rishi Ganga, in eco-sensitive zones “without proper clearance”.

“Was it a glacial burst or an avalanche?” questioned Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People amid the revival of debate around infrastructure projects by those upset with the Centre and state clearances for massive infrastructure activities in fragile, eco-sensitive regions of the Himalayas.

A former member of the Narendra Modi Cabinet, Uma Bharti adds it’s something she had warned against as a minister and that the tragedy is both a matter of concern and warning. “When I was the minister, my ministry, in its affidavit about dams in Uttarakhand, had requested that it is a sensitive region. Therefore, power projects should not be built on the Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said. While Bharti said electricity shortfall could have been met by the national grid, Thakkar added that wind and solar were better ways to generate power in mountains.

There are around 98 dams in Uttarakhand. Besides, rapid infrastructure development of roads, highways, hotels is taking place in the state, leading to “virtual shake-up” of the “young” mountains. Activists have been cautioning about “weakening” of “young mountains” due to dynamite blasts and “manmade fires”.",2021-02-09 08:00:00+00:00,"['glacier', 'state', 'thakkar', 'mountains', 'infrastructure', 'tragedy', 'projects', 'dams', 'power', 'burst', 'experts', 'uttarakhand', 'debate', 'avalanche', 'young']",India,news article,English

Liverpool 1-2 Crystal Palace

Premier League, Anfield

April 23, 2017

Goals: Coutinho 25′; Benteke 43′, 74′

Taking on a Palace side battling to avoid relegation, it was always going to be a difficult afternoon for Jurgen Klopp‘s Reds.

But after Philippe Coutinho broke the deadlock with an excellent free-kick, it was hugely disappointing to let the points go as Christian Benteke’s brace struck his old club.

With just four games left to play before the end of the season, and with Man United producing a 2-0 win away to Burnley earlier on Sunday, this was a frustrating result in the Reds’ top-four pursuit.

Here’s how supporters reacted to Liverpool’s 2-1 loss at home to Palace on social media.

Teenager Rhian Brewster’s inclusion was a surprise…

Description of the disaster

The central region of Viet Nam was experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems  the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimetres of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 150 millimetres of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. Additionally, Tropical Storm Saudel hit Viet Nam on 25 October closely followed by Typhoon Molave on 28 October. Typhoon Molave was one of the most devastating typhoons making landfall in Vietnam in decades. The typhoon made landfall after a series of tropical storms hitting Viet Nam and had caused severe flooding and at least three landslides which tragically resulted in the loss of 40 lives. 44 people are still missing, and six people are severely injured. On 5 November, Typhoon Goni made landfall in Viet Nam and Tropical Storm Atsani made landfall on 7 November. Tropical storm Vamco, was the latest to hit central Viet Nam as it made landfall on 15 November 2020.

The recurrent storms bringing heavy rainfall have caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. The Viet Nam National Disaster Management Agency (VNDMA) has reported that many areas in central Vietnam recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 1,600 millimeters between 5 to 20 October 2020, with peaks of 2,400 millimeters in some locations over the same period. The Hieu River (Quang Tri), Bo River (Hue), Gianh River and Kien Giang River (Quang Binh) have reached historically high levels, and in some locations flood waters have exceeded the previous historical highs recorded in 1979 and 1999. In addition, hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs to prevent them from bursting.

Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Nghe An to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Click here to see the map of affected areas.

Authorities estimate that a nearly eight million people have been exposed to the storms, and some 1.5 million people have been directly affected by the storms and floods. On 4 November, ahead of typhoon Gonis landfall, 98,819 households (372,631 people) in six provinces (Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen) were evacuated to safe shelters. Similarly, evacuations took place on 7 November in anticipation of typhoon Atsani, and on the 15th November ahead of typhoon Vamcos landfall additional evacuations have been carried out in seven provinces of central Viet Nam with a total of 93,795 households (324,780 people) evacuated to safer places (Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai).

Most of the people who had been evacuated have now returned home after their local authorities approval. They are actively repairing their homes with the help of their relatives. However, according to the VNDMA 31,637 households must be urgently relocated because they lost their shelter or their houses which have collapsed or been too heavily damaged, and they are now living with host families. After the latest typhoon (Vamco), according to the VNDMA, at least 243 are reported to have been killed or are missing and over two million livestock have been killed or swept away. The floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure including roads, schools, health centres and community facilities. It is reported that 1,569 schools have been affected included 360 schools flooded or damaged, while 46,916 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people are now in desperate needs of emergency relief, such as safe shelter, safe drinking water, food and livelihood income support.",2020-12-01 08:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'n', 'nam', 'update', 'mdrvn020', 'quang', 'provinces', 'viet', 'storms', 'emergency', 'tropical', 'typhoon', 'n1', 'floods', 'central', 'storm', 'operation', 'landfall']",Vietnam,news article,English

The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, is set to establish his company, Starlink, in Nigeria; a move that will pit it against network providers like MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile.

Starlink is under SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer, which is also owned by Musk. The billionaire wants to bring satellite-led broadband into Nigeria, and his SpaceX team has met with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The meeting involved Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, who was represented by Ubale Maska, the executive commissioner of NCC.

Both parties met to discuss the plan Starlink has for the market in Africa's largest economy, and the company is pursuing the necessary licenses to set up its base in Nigeria.

In a statement released by NCC, it was stated that:

""SpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.

""SpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.""

Presently, the biggest internet service providers are GSM-led in the name of MTN Nigeria, Globacom, Airtel Nigeria and 9mobile. With the financial power that Starlink through SpaceX, analyses have shown a potential clash.

Starlink establishment in Nigeria is expected to crash data cost and improve service, both of which have constantly been complained of by telecoms subscribers.

The best network service in Nigeria is costly within the country, so is the telcos with poor quality service - this has left subscribers with no choice but to settle.

Meanwhile, YEN.com.gh had previously reported that the Lagos State government wants to create its own rice mill to produce Lake Rice after one year of disruption to the operation.

Lake Rice had started four years ago, but it stopped operation in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic hit Nigeria. Kebbi is where the first rice mill is, and it was affected by flood as well.

Lagos State plans to stop being a receiver of processed rice and start processing its own Lake Rice, starting with the Kebbi State government.

990,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Analysis: Myanmar's neighbour Thailand unlikely to toughen stance on coup - WHBL News,https://whbl.com/2021/04/02/analysis-myanmars-neighbour-thailand-unlikely-to-toughen-stance-on-coup/,"By Kay Johnson and Panarat Thepgumpanat

BANGKOK (Reuters) – Thailand has slightly hardened its language on Myanmar by saying it is “gravely concerned” about escalating bloodshed since a Feb. 1 coup, but close military ties and fears of a flood of refugees mean it is unlikely to go further, analysts say.

That leaves Thailand out of step with some members of the 10-strong Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as they seek to ramp up pressure on the junta, but could also position it as a possible mediator.

“(Thailand’s position) is difficult, but I think there is an opportunity because we’ve become an important partner,” Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.

The closeness of the Thai and Myanmar armies was underscored by a request from Myanmar’s junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to “support democracy” within days of ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Prayuth, who voiced that support, had himself seized power in a 2014 coup when army chief, before taking on his current civilian role in 2019 and rejecting opposition accusations that the vote was manipulated.

The personal relationship began much earlier: within armies that appear to have long put behind them the historic rivalry between countries that used to be known as Burma and Siam.

In 2018, Min Aung Hlaing was awarded Thailand’s King Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant “in honour of the support he has shown for the Thai military,” the Bangkok Post said at the time.

BROTHERHOOD

“For them, the military brotherhood is very, very important,” said Lalita Hingkanonta, a history professor at Thailand’s Kasetsart University.

“I don’t think that the escalation of violence will change the decision of the Thai government to accept more refugees…I think they just want to be friends with Myanmar more.”

Thailand potentially has more at stake in Myanmar than any other member of ASEAN, as it shares a 2,400-km (1,500-mile) border that is also Myanmar’s longest with any neighbour.

The geographical position, and a tradition of cautious diplomacy have been reasons for its particular care in remarks on the coup – only toughening its wording slightly after the civilian death toll topped 500 in Myanmar’s crackdown on anti-coup protesters.

Thailand’s wording has still been much milder than that of ASEAN democracies Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

The border risks were highlighted by a surge of several thousand refugees this week fleeing bombing by Myanmar’s forces of ethnic Karen rebels, an exodus reminiscent of the tens of thousands who fled Myanmar’s wars in previous decades.

Although Thailand denied that the latest refugees were being pushed back, they complained of having been blocked by Thai border guards, while a local Thai official told a meeting that it was official policy to bar their entry.

GESTURES

While Thailand might come under diplomatic pressure to accept refugees or take a tougher stance, Lalita said Prayuth’s government was unlikely to be moved.

“They would do something to respond to the international pressure, they would do some small things, just to show that, hey, we are responding very well to your concern. But that’s it.”

Business links are also strong.

Foreign direct investment by Thai businesses ranks behind only China and Singapore, with more than $11 billion approved since 1988.

Annual cross-border trade stood at more than $9 billion in 2019 and many Thai businesses rely on Myanmar migrant workers – who officially number 1.6 million.

Thailand matters even more for Myanmar, accounting for nearly a quarter of exports in 2019, mostly natural gas.

But Thailand was unlikely to use its potential economic leverage with any sanctions on trade, said Piti Srisangnam, of the ASEAN Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University.

He suggested Thailand might best pursue diplomacy behind the scenes, to try to encourage Myanmar’s generals to curb violence and launch talks with ousted civilians now locked up or branded as traitors.

“If you have one friend you’ve known for a very long time, and one day he commits murder, it doesn’t mean you won’t be friends with him, right?” he said.

“You are still friends, but the best thing is to talk to him, to show that the thing he has done is very wrong.”

611,Drought Sri Lanka,Herbal defluoridation of drinking water - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130305100928.htm,"Researchers in India have developed a filter system based on a medicinal herb, which they say can quickly and easily remove ""fluoride"" from drinking water. The technology described in the March issue of the International Journal of Environmental Engineering uses parts of the plant Tridax procumbens as a biocarbon filter for the ion.

Drinking water can contain natural fluoride or fluoride might be added as a protective agent for teeth by water companies. However, its presence is not without controversy while in some natural drinking water levels may be above those considered safe by the World Health Organisation. Chemist Malairajan Singanan of the Presidency College (Autonomous), in Chennai, points out that the WHO guidelines suggest that a safe level of fluoride is 1.5 milligrams per liter. He adds that various techniques to reduce fluoride content have been tried including coagulation, adsorption, precipitation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and electrodialysis. However, metal ions with an affinity for fluoride in a biocarbon matrix represent a promising new approach.

Singanan has investigated Tridax procumbens, which is commonly used as a medicinal herb in India, as a biocarbon absorbent for fluoride. Previously, the plant has been tested in the extraction of toxic heavy metals from water. He explains that by loading up plant tissue with aluminum ions it is possible create a safe biocarbon filter that will readily absorb fluoride ions from water warmed to around 27 Celsius passing through the filter. His trials show that it takes just three hours to remove 98% of fluoride with just 2 grams of the biocarbon filter.

The biocarbon filter might provide an inexpensive way to defluoridate water in regions where the natural level of this mineral is high in ground water, including India, China, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Spain, Holland, Italy, Mexico, North and South America. It might also be adapted for those consumers who wish to reduce their exposure to fluoride, despite its dental health benefits, in parts of the world where it is added to the water supply for public health reasons.",2013-03-05 08:00:00+00:00,"['safe', 'india', 'filter', 'natural', 'drinking', 'water', 'plant', 'health', 'fluoride', 'herbal', 'defluoridation', 'ions', 'biocarbon']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The pair from the United States and Sweden went missing last month on a mission to the Kasai Central province where rebels had intensified their anti-government insurgency in recent weeks, killing dozens on both sides.

U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said her colleagues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have seen the video, stating they are utterly horrified at what appears to be the killing of Michael Sharp and Zeida Catalan.

As we mourn these deaths, we urge the government of the DRC to ensure that these killings and the hundreds of others such horrible killings that have taken place in the Kasai region are credibly.

“As we mourn these deaths, we urge the government of the DRC to ensure that these killings and the hundreds of others such horrible killings that have taken place in the Kasai region are credibly, thoroughly and promptly investigated and that the perpetrators are brought to justice in line with international human rights law,” she said.

The video screened to the media in Kinshasa on Monday appeared to show the two experts walking with a group of men wearing red headbands characteristic of the Kamuina Nsapu local militia.

“Outside Kananga city in the Kasai Central province and therefore not far from Moyo bridge in the Dibaya territory, the bodies were indeed found in a grave and were identified, formally, by the MONUSCO experts, specifically members of the United Nations police and that is why it took time all day yesterday.But as soon as they were formally identified, the United Nations Secretary-general was informed and the families, following protocol,” said Information Director,Charles Bambara.

716,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Rising Sea Levels Threaten Egypt’s Alexandria - VOA Learning English,https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/rising-sea-levels-threaten-egypt-s-alexandria/5067579.html,"Rising sea levels are threatening parts of the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria.

Alexander the Great established the city more than 2,000 years ago. In that time, it has survived invasions, fires and earthquakes.

But, Alexandria now faces severe flooding from rising waters blamed on climate change.

Alexandria is Egypt’s second largest city, with more than 5 million people. It is also an important port and home to about 40 percent of Egypt’s industrial activity. The city is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea and sits next to a lake.

Officials have built concrete barriers in the sea in an effort to reduce the force of waves. A severe storm in 2015 flooded large parts of the city. At least six people were killed in the flooding, which also caused the collapse of many homes.

In the late 1940s and 50s, Alexandria was a popular place for writers and artists from Egypt and other countries. Today, more than 60 kilometers of waterfront make Alexandria a top summer vacation spot. However, many of the city’s most famous beaches are already showing signs of damage.

The United Nations has warned that worldwide sea levels could rise by 0.98 meters by 2100, with “serious implications for coastal cities, deltas and low-lying states.”

Egypt’s Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation said the sea level rose by an average of 1.8 millimeters each year until 1993. Over the next 20 years, it rose by 2.1 millimeters a year. Since 2012, however, the rate became 3.2 millimeters each year.

Measurements show that the land on which Alexandria is built is also sinking at about the same rate. This is expected to increase the risk of dangerous flooding.

A 2018 research study predicted that up to 734 square kilometers of the Nile Delta could be under water by 2050. People living in low-lying areas are already experiencing problems.

A 52-year-old resident of the Shatby neighborhood, Abu Randa, said he has repaired his three-story home twice since the 2015 floods. “We know it is risky. We know that the entire area will be underwater, but we have no alternative,” he told The Associated Press.

Sayed Khalil is a 67-year-old fisherman living in the el-Max neighborhood, where hundreds of people were forced to leave their homes after the flooding in 2015. He said homes have flooded with seawater every winter in recent years. “It is hard to imagine that el-Max will be here in a few decades,” Khalil said. “All these houses might vanish. The area you see now will be an underwater museum.”

The government built sea defenses to protect the neighborhood, but people who live there say it has not made a big difference. “Every year the waves are much stronger than the previous year,” said Abdel-Nabi el-Sayad, a 39-year-old fisherman. “We did not see any improvement. They just forced people to leave.”

Some of the city’s archaeological treasures are also threatened. Among them is the citadel of Qaitbay, a fortress built in the Middle Ages on the ruins of the ancient Pharos lighthouse in the central harbor.

Ashour Abdel-Karim is head of Egypt’s General Authority for Shores Protection. He said the citadel is especially at risk. Powerful waves continue to push against the structure’s foundation. Officials were forced to build a long line of concrete sea barriers that can be seen from the downtown waterfront area known as the Corniche.

The Egyptian government has put aside more than $120 million for the barriers and other protective measures along the shore, Abdel-Karim said. He added that without barriers, parts of the Corniche and other buildings near the shore would be damaged. If that happens, he said, repairs could cost nearly $25 billion.

933,FL-2021-000021-IND,Uttarakhand govt says 'will investigate all aspects of glacier burst' - Mint,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/uttarakhand-govt-says-will-investigate-all-aspects-of-glacier-burst-11613446147104.html,"The Uttarakhand government will create a department to investigate the cause of the glacier burst that led to flash floods, state irrigation minister Satpal Maharaj said on Monday.

""All angles (related to the Chamoli glacier burst) should be investigated. We will form a department in our ministry to monitor and study all the glaciers through satellite,"" said Maharaj.

""We are concerned over the way glaciers are melting and the tidal wave created in the mountains. The plutonium pack that was kept to monitor China's movement should also be investigated,"" he added.

Speaking about a lost plutonium pack in the region, the minister said: ""Orders were made to place plutonium pack to monitor China's movement at the borders. We request the government to investigate the pack too.""

In 1965 a plutonium pack was lost while installing a radar system on the summit of Nanda Devi mountain in Uttarakhand. Environmental experts worry that if glacier breaks in Chamoli cause any damage to this plutonium pack, it could lead to severe nuclear radiation pollution in the waters.

Maharaj further stated that the railway projects in the area are safe.

""As the water in the Srinagar dam was depleted, the debris flowing to the dam came to halt, keeping the railway projects safe,"" he said.

A few days ago, scientists who are investigating the flood said that the incident took place after a Himalayan glacier from a remote peak fell into the water.

""In the flash flood incident, scientists have observed a rockfall from a height of 5,600 meters. Since that support from the bottom had fallen, glacier fell down. The area has very steep slope into the mountain region,"" said the director of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.

Meanwhile, the death toll in the incident had reached 58 with 11 more bodies being discovered from Tapovan tunnel in Joshimath of Chamoli district. As many as 146 people are yet to be found.

Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel along with National Disaster Response Force and other sister agencies have been conducting search and rescue operation in Chamoli district.

A glacier burst in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli District of Uttarakhand last week led to massive flooding in the Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.

637,Drought Sri Lanka,Piaggio to challenge Bajaj in city 3-Wheelers - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/piaggio-to-challenge-bajaj-in-city-3-wheelers-113031200446_1.html,"Piaggio Vehicles, the Pune-based scooter and light commercial vehicle manufacturer, is entering the city three wheeler market with its new product Ape City, to challenge market leader Bajaj Auto.

The subsidiary of Italian Piaggio & C s.p.a has launched the new class of city-centric passenger three wheelers under the Ape City brand. The company is aiming to upset Bajaj Auto's dominance in the three wheeler segment.

The city three-wheeler market, whose sales are dictated by state governments based on the number of permits issued for most centers, is about 150,000 units per year. Piaggio is aiming to have 15-20% market share in this segment by end of this calendar year.

The Ape City costs Rs 1.10 lakh for petrol, Rs 1.23 lakh for LPG and Rs 1.25 lakh for CNG (ex-Maharashtra). Piaggio presently has a market share of 31% in the passenger three wheeler space while Bajaj Auto leads with a share of 50%.

Other players in the passenger segment includes Mahindra & Mahindra, Atul Auto, TVS Motors and Scooters India. The segment has grown by 9% to 370,868 units during the period April-January this year as against 340,032 units sold same period last year.

Ravi Chopra, chairman and managing director, Piaggio Vehicle said, ""We were not present in the market segment which required alternate fuels like petrol, CNG and LPG. So we developed a compact fuel-efficient three wheeler for urban passenger movement."" Many city regulations require three wheelers to be powered by cleaner fuels like CNG or LPG.

The three-wheelers will be built at the company's manufacturing plant in Baramati, Maharashtra which has an installed capacity of over 250,000 for three-wheelers.

Bajaj Auto sales in this segment rose to 186,420 units, a growth of 15% in the reported period as against 162,062 units sold in the same segment last year. While Piaggio reported a growth of four% at 110,943 units.

The total three wheeler sales (goods and passenger) in the April-January period stood at 450,645 units, an increase of five% as compared to 428,764 units sold in the same period last year.

Bajaj remains the market leader in the total domestic three-wheeler segment with a share of 42% followed by Piaggio with a share of 34%. Mumbai-based M&M remains the third biggest player in the segment with a share of 12%.

Piaggio is also targeting the export market with this new product with at least 50,000 units in the next 18-20 months. The export segment is about 300,000 units per year presently with the company hoping to begin shipments to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Africa and Latin America in the next few months.",2013-03-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['sold', 'city', 'share', 'segment', 'wheeler', 'period', 'market', 'bajaj', '3wheelers', 'challenge', 'passenger', 'units', 'piaggio']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
1062,FL-2020-000207-NGA,28 states at risk of flood - Agency - Premium Times,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/395058-28-states-at-risk-of-flood-agency.html,"No fewer than 102 local government areas in 28 states are at risk of flooding, according to the 2020 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO), released by the Nigeria Hydrological Survey Agency (NIHSA) on Thursday.

The states include the states of Rivers, Cross River, Delta, Lagos, Ondo, Bayelsa, Sokoto, Kogi, Niger, Kaduna, Gombe, Adamawa, Benue, FCT, Nasarawa, Delta, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Edo, Abia, Anambra, Imo, Borno, Kano and Kebbi.

At the Official Presentation of the outlook in Abuja, the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, noted that the outlook was a fallout from the devastating effect of the 2012 flood in the country.

He said the purpose of the outlook was to present probable flood scenarios for this year and to disseminate information to all, especially in flood-prone areas and further reduce resultant effects.

He said flood is one of the most frequent natural disasters in Nigeria with devastating impact on the poor and vulnerable populations who live along river banks and rely on flood plains for livelihoods.

He said although the flood outlook had shown that 2020 floods might not be as severe as previous years, it was important for all stakeholders to carry out an aggressive awareness campaign for preparedness.

It is pertinent to note that the impending flooding season with COVID-19 presents a fight against two threats; on one hand, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and on the other hand, the likelihood of an active 2020 flood season.

The 2020 flood projections will as expected vary from moderate to severe flooding in most parts of the country.

Overall, the flood level may not be as severe as previous years, but it is a certainty that our rivers will exceed flood level and many will be inundated again this year.

The minister said as always, flooding was associated with increased risk of infections when the displaced persons were high and polluted water sources, added that it was important for all stakeholders to prepare earnestly.

He added that part of the intervention to promote hygiene was the recently signed Executive Order 009 by the President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at ending Open Defecation by 2025.

Many state governors have bought into this idea, the ministry declared emergency in the water and sanitation sector to encourage hand washing and put in place the National WASH Response Committee for COVID -19, he said.

The minister also commended the efforts of NIHSA in the development of a new Flood Mobile App, saying that it would add practical value to water managers and for overall disaster risks management.

The NIHSAs Director-General, Clement Nze, said the 2020 AFO would go beyond borders and defer all barriers to reach the needy in providing information on early flood warnings required for mitigating risks in the country.

Mr Nze noted that the need to carry out aggressive sensitisation and awareness campaigns on consistent clearing of all waterways and maintenance of dams and reservoirs to ensure free flow of water in drainages.

The D-G said the Flood Mobile App would also be used to give actual daily flood situations to everyone, especially those at the rural areas through the use of SMS services.

The new Flood Mobile App is designed to be of practical value to the Water Managers, Technical Experts, Disaster Risk Managers, Policy Makers and Flood Forecasting Community for flood prevention and for enhancing flood early warning systems in Nigeria.

587,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Gov't accused GPSU of plot to disrupt country - Stabroek News,https://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/09/11/news/guyana/gov%E2%80%99t-accused-gpsu-of-plot-to-disrupt-country/,"The Government of Guyana in early 2006 believed that the Guyana Public Service Union (GPSU) was planning to disrupt the country with the aid of the “Buxton resistance group” according to former US Ambassador Roland Bullen.

In a February 15, 2006 cable to Washington, titled ‘Labour struggles to unify as GOG seizes initiative,’ Bullen said the information was provided to the embassy by high ranking officials in the Office of the President.

Bullen, describing the prevailing labour issues that existed at that time, said that underlying those issues was a political context of “suspicion and division within the labor movement in Guyana, much of it deeply personal.”

At that time the GPSU was in an ongoing struggle for government salary arbitration, although Bullen noted that government condemned the union’s actions as politically motivated.

“[Name of the official] provided EconOff a briefing paper ostensibly based on information received from dissident members of the GPSU that alleges that union is planning to disrupt the country with the support of ‘the Buxton resistance group’ in the coming months,” Bullen said in the cable.

The statement provided by the official also alleged that the US Diaspora was “financing arrangements in the hopes that the GPSU can act along the lines of the political strikes of the 1960s.”

“While the credibility of such claims is uncertain, this sentiment is indicative of the long history of suspicion that clouds labour unions in Guyana,” Bullen noted.

He said during the meeting with embassy officials, the OP official also insisted that the GPSU missed a “golden opportunity” for compromise 18 months before, when its President Patrick Yarde apparently undermined negotiations with the Office of the President by blasting President Bharrat Jagdeo on an a television talk show.

For his part, Yarde, Bullen said, accused the government of heavy-handedness in its handling of the union’s demonstrations to date. Yarde labeled the heavy police presence along the GPSU’s February 8, 2005 march route as a “blatant act of intimidation” and blamed it for the low turnout. Yarde also insisted that he received word from private sector sources that President Jagdeo had said he would just as soon eliminate the GPSU if he could find a way to do so.

At the time GPSU had announced a second lunchtime march planned for the same route on February 15, 2005. Yarde had stated his commitment to non-violent industrial action, and the prospects of major civil disruption seemed unlikely to Bullen for several reasons.

“First, the low turnout at the previous march, be it due to intimidation or a lack of coordination within the public service union, suggests the mandate for major industrial action on the part of the PSU’s membership is weak,” he said

Bullen felt at the time that the wage increase seemed to have “undercut the union’s efforts to mobilize its sagging membership.”

Yarde had observed that resource constraints may limit the GPSU’s ability to sustain action along the lines of the 57-day strike in 1999, after which the union lost its ability to automatically collect membership dues as an agency shop.",2011-09-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['country', 'accused', 'bullen', 'guyana', 'labour', 'disrupt', 'provided', 'yarde', 'union', 'govt', 'gpsu', 'plot', 'official', 'unions', 'president']",China,news article,English

Is the state ready for the heavy downpour?

Business & Politics News - India & You

Criss-crossed by several rivers, including the mighty Ganges, West Bengal has traditionally been vulnerable to heavy floods each year. With the Monsoon knocking its door, is the state better prepared this year?

After two years of deficient rains, the India Meteorological Department (Met) has forecast that this year the monsoons would be higher than usual, about 106 of the average. The news was bound to bring cheer to hundreds of millions of farmers around the country whose crops have been ruined for two years running due to scanty or untimely rains. Yet, there would be some trepidation as well, especially in states that are particularly vulnerable to heavy floods even during a year with average rains.

West Bengal is one such state, which has floods even when rest of the country cries out for rains as it happened in 2015 when despite a 14 pc deficit in rains, severe floods in 12 districts of West Bengal affected around 3.7 million people.

West Bengal has 37,660 sq. km flood prone area while the total geographical area of the state is 88,752 sq. km. The flood problems of the state are different in different regions. Along with the Ganges, the rivers Teesta, Torsa, Jaldhaka and Raidak flow through the districts of Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. They originate either in the neighbouring country of Bhutan or the state of Sikkim and flows down to West Bengal before reaching Bangladesh. While in some places excessive monsoons bring serious flash floods, dam breaks have also caused catastrophic flooding in Bengal. Neutralising flood risks have always been a daunting task for the government in the history, will it deliver this year?

Barely a month after Mamata Banerjee took oath as the Chief Minister for the second time, after having scored a thumping win in the elections; the Met forecasts spread panic in the closed door meetings of the new government. The West Bengal state government alarmed by the onset of monsoon is planning measures to limit floods and its consequent annihilation.

DVC aids flood management

The government formed two dedicated flood control rooms — one in North Bengal and another in the south and two senior officials have been posted at the DVC (Damodar Valley Corporation) headquarters to monitor the situation. The control rooms would ensure that the government is forewarned on the release of water from the dams. Moreover, the top state bureaucrats will be meeting every day at Nabanna (the state secretariat of West Bengal) and monitor the government’s response to heavy monsoons this year.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee blamed DVC for floods in some parts of the state last year. The government had alleged that sudden release of water from DVC dams without proper intimation had caused loss of lives and livestock. However, the Damodar Valley Corporation, this year has assured West Bengal government of support and better co-ordination with regard to release of water from its dams as in heavy monsoon situations which are likely to trigger floods.

Other measures

Apart from these measures, the irrigation department has identified 145 kilometres of vulnerable river embankments and dams. While the restoration work has already begun, the government is also keeping a close watch on the other river banks especially in the rural areas.

According to sources, the state government is also discussing disaster measures with national and international NGOs such as the Red Cross Society, Bharat Sevashram and St John Ambulance services. The disaster management department has reportedly dispatched teams and relief materials to the flood-prone districts of the state. However, speculations are still lingering about political prejudice and foul play with regard to distribution of flood relief in remote areas.",2016-06-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['group', 'rains', 'bengal', 'flood', 'dams', 'vulnerable', 'west', 'floods', 'state', 'india', 'water', 'heavy', 'media']",India,news article,English

Meteorologist Luke Robinson said there could be significant rain in some areas around west central Montana.

We are looking at some rain moving into the area starting mid week to the end of the week, said Robinson. This week we are looking at some pretty good soaking rains, particularly in southwest Montana and west central Montana. We will see the rivers and streams rising but right now we're not really anticipating any impacts from it.

Robinson said the cold front will bring accompanying snow to the higher mountain areas.

This system is moving in, it's going to be relatively cold, so we're actually looking at some accumulating snow in the mountains, he said. Those cooler temperatures will cut off all the hot mountain snow melt that we've had the past few days and most of the rise in the rivers and streams will be coming from mid to low level moisture coming into the area.

Robinson said people who live in areas that usually flood in the spring may be nervous to see the river levels rising.

It could be more of just a nervous thing, right now, he said. We're looking at the cresting below flood stage, and that will be sometime Thursday or Friday. But right now we're not expecting any flooding at this at this point.

810,FL-2019-000084-IND,WATCH: Assam MLA gets his hands dirty to drain out flood water - EastMojo,https://www.eastmojo.com/news/2019/07/25/watch-assam-mla-gets-his-hands-dirty-to-drain-out-flood-water/,"Guwahati: Notice this person closely — he is trying to drain out flood water from his house using a bucket. It is symbolic. Even he knows that a bucket is not going to help him clear the flooding and that he is not effectively getting rid of the water.

But the man is aware that a letter to the Indian Railways is what can possibly change the entire scenario with the onset of monsoon fury.

The man in the video that has now gone viral also happens to be Rabiram Narzary, the MLA from Kokrajhar West in Assam. Sadly, this is an annual feature in the Tengapara area of Kokrajhar, which houses Narzary’s residence-cum-office.

“For the effective solution of this annual flash floods in Kokrajhar, the Railways should come up with a new scheme. The small hume pipes which are being used by the railways for allowing water to flow under a railroad from one side to the other should be replaced by culverts. Only then the water will drain properly and we will be relieved,” Narzary said.

This is an annual feature in the Tengapara area of Kokrajhar, which houses MLA Rabiram Narzary’s residence-cum-office

Every year, it is the same story at several places of the Bodoland Territorial Council-administered Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD), including Kokrajhar. The entire district gets waterlogged with floodwaters entering private residences causing great distress to the locals.

Narzary’s house has been waterlogged for the past 48 hours. He said that this is the second time in a little over 10 days that his house has been partially submerged. “Only because the water doesn’t drain out properly of these hume pipes many villages and localities are submerged,” he added.

The MLA suggests that the railway authorities should do a re-survey on this issue and the entire thing has to be re-designed and re-constructed. Until that happens, the MLA has to wait for specialised equipment for the clean-up drive.

More by this Author Summary Heavy overnight downpour that pounded Nairobi Monday has exposed the underbelly of the city that is poor drainage system.

Pools of water, flooded roads and over-flowing storm water drainages characterised most parts of the capital as residents woke up to a heavy rain causing pools of water.

Heavy overnight downpour that pounded Nairobi Monday has exposed the underbelly of the city that is poor drainage system.

Pools of water, flooded roads and over-flowing storm water drainages characterised most parts of the capital as residents woke up to a heavy rain causing pools of water that mixed with mounds of garbage, turning the city into an eyesore.

Nairobi residents were forced to hop, skip and jump through the puddles of water while businesses were interrupted as most of them had their entrance blocked by the sudden â??lakesâ? with flood-prone areas submerged in water.

â??I cannot open my business as usual because of the flash floods as I have to wait for the pools of water. This is crazy,â? said Mary Njeri, a shop owner in Nairobiâ??s city centre.

â??Look at my shoes, they are dirty after having to wade through the pools. This means I have to spend at least Sh50 bob to clean them,â? said James Omondi.

But this situation will not be a one-off with the Kenya Meteorological Department warning that the heavy rains in the city will continue throughout the week.

When it rains in Nairobi, the central business district to the outskirts of the city centre, flash floods and stagnant water have been a constant fixture.

The problem has been blamed on outdated designs and continuous dumping of solid waste in drainage systems.

Constructions on road reserves as well as trading activities including selling building materials like sand, stones, and ballast, some of which end up in the drains, have also been faulted for blocking the drainage systems.

â??The county government has never taken any step to address drainage issue in Nairobi. We are used to the floods whenever it rains so it does not come as a surprise,â? said another trader on Moi Avenue in Nairobi.

The menace has been perennial despite millions of shillings being spent by City Hall annually to address poor drainage systems in Nairobi.

When former Governor Mike Sonko assumed office, he accused his predecessor, Dr Evans Kidero, of squandering funds meant for rehabilitating drainage system in the county. But he fared no better with his administration also spending millions to address the problem with no tangible results.

In March 2018, City Hall together with the Directorate of Urban and Nairobi Metropolitan Development set aside Sh194 million to address the flooding menace in Nairobi. A total of Sh32 million was to be used to improve the drainage system in the county and put up measures to mitigate the effects of the heavy rains.",2021-05-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['drainage', 'nairobi', 'heavy', 'exposes', 'poor', 'pools', 'city', 'address', 'underbelly', 'water', 'deep', 'rains', 'rain', 'runs']",Kenya,news article,English

This is as the government has warned against heavy rainfall, flooding and possible flood disasters.

While making the disclosure through a signed statement, the Honorable Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said 23 million cubic meters of water will be released in October, which is the peak of the rainfall season.

READ:

Bello explained that the release of more water from the Oyan Dam, which will be the highest so far, is due to intensive rainfall over the past few days, expected to peak in the current month.

He, therefore, enjoined all residents of Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun and all areas bordering the rivers and the sea in Lagos to be wary of the staggered Oyan Dam release, adding that by November, a reduced release of 11million cubic meters will be affected as the intensity of the rainfall declines.

Bello pointed out that data provided by the Nigerian Hydrological Services noted that the months of July, August, September and October would be characterized by heavy rainfall, flooding and flood disasters in most parts of the country.

READ:

Reiterating that the reminder became necessary because the projected heavy rainfall, which had increased in September, would continue with high intensity this month leading to the staggered release of water from the dam, the Commissioner disclosed that Lagos is, however, intensifying measures to minimize the effect of the heavy rainfall on lives and property.

He averred that, in continuation of the preventive efforts against flooding by the State Government, work is almost completed on all the primary and secondary channels, stating that this is in addition to the efforts of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gangs (EFAG) that are being deployed around the State to undertake quick fixes of clogged manholes or drains manually.

Bello said, For a coastal city like Lagos, let me remind everyone that once it rains consistently for a minimum of eight hours, we are bound to have flash floods caused by the increasing inability of effective discharge into the lagoon, which is brought about by a rise in the ocean level. This will automatically lock up all our drainages and would be unable to discharge until the water level goes down.

Flash floods are not peculiar to Lagos. It is the new wave in most coastal cities around the world, including those who have adopted the best of technological advancements to curtail flooding. Lagos is at the receiving end of three types of flooding, namely Coastal, Urban and River flooding because of the peculiarity of its location.

While urging residents to adopt an attitudinal change by not dumping refuse in drainage channels and erecting structures on drainage alignments, Bello vowed that anyone caught violating the environmental laws of the State would be punished accordingly.

The Commissioner also emphasized that all residents owe the state a duty to support the efforts of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to ensure that heavy rainfall does not wreak havoc in any part of the metropolis.",2020-10-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['residents', 'release', 'water', 'flooding', 'state', 'cautions', 'flood', 'lagos', 'disaster', 'warns', 'rainfall', 'dam', 'heavy', 'oyan']",Nigeria,news article,English

Lake Ontario is higher than average and expected to keep rising.

The International Lake Ontario – St. Lawrence River Board is controlling the amount of water it lets through the Moses Saunders dam at Massena – balancing the high lake waters with flooding downstream at Montreal, where the Ottawa River is contributing to a state of emergency.

Board member Tony David says as long as flows from Ottawa River remain high, release of water through the Moses – Saunders dam near Massena will continue to be restricted.

According to David, “Those constraints to outflows from Lake Ontario - looks that they will continue to apply in the coming days.”

David says water levels in the lake are still significantly lower than two years ago, when there was major flooding.

But that’s likely to change in the coming days.

David said, “Given the situation with the reductions in outflow, we are actually expected to get caught up to where we were in 2017 fairly quickly to where in the next seven to 10 days.”

David said the international board can try to influence high water in Lake Ontario, but it can’t control the lake’s level. It can only manage outflows based on conditions in the St. Lawrence River.",2019-05-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['relief', 'water', 'river', 'ontario', 'high', 'saunders', 'upstream', 'canada', 'slows', 'daysdavid', 'lake', 'st', 'outflows', 'lawrence', 'flooding']",Canada,news article,English

The State government has on Wednesday given in-principle approval to the district administration’s proposal to treat the water accumulated in abandoned stone quarries and distribute it as drinking water using the reverse osmosis technology.

A meeting to discuss the proposal in detail will be held towards the end of this month, District Collector P.I. Sheikh Pareed told The Hindu after meeting Revenue Minister Adoor Prakash. Fund for the project has been sought from the drought relief fund.

The district administration has drawn up a proposal worth Rs. 33 lakh for launching the project on a pilot basis at a quarry at Ambalappara near Kakkanad. Initially, 15,000 litres will be treated a day for which a cost effective technology has been developed. The project will be expanded to cover more abandoned stone quarries if found successful.

Mr. Pareed said he had got the water sample from the Ambalappara quarry tested by a private agency entrusted with developing the technology, and the Water Authority. He said the idea was to construct a small retaining wall around the quarry to conserve it like a rainwater harvesting centre. The agency selected will install the machinery for the treatment process. “There is also an idea to develop a compact mobile treatment unit,” Mr. Pareed said.

However, V.N. Sivasankara Pillai, former director at the School of Environment Studies, Cochin University of Science and Technology, feels that the proposal is “not as simple as it looks.”

He said while the water collected in such quarries could be used for construction and similar purposes, its treatment for drinking water could prove expensive. “Water in abandoned quarries may have got collected over a period of time, leading to gradual growth of algae. Separating algae calls for an advanced and expensive treatment process different from the treatment methods adopted by agencies like the Water Authority to purify river water,” he said.

Mr. Pillai said water collected in quarries needs to be recharged to maintain the water balance. Recharging through rain is inadequate as a good portion of water is lost to evaporation. In such circumstances, water will have to be pumped in from surrounding areas. “Since there is thick population around these quarries, pumping in water from outside would not be safe,” he said.

Mr. Pillai recollected that a similar proposal to treat water from an abandoned quarry in Vennala by the corporation was dropped after the rehabilitation of families in the nearby areas became a problem.

District officer at the Groundwater Department V. Prasannan said there were two ways in which abandoned quarries can be utilized to meet the water needs. “The already collected water should be pumped out and the quarries should be completely cleaned after which a retaining wall should be constructed around them to prevent the inflow of polluted water from adjoining areas. In that way, quarries can be used as rainwater storage tanks,” he said.

If the inflow of water from surrounding areas is facilitated then the water should be purified before usage. Since the water is free of salinity its treatment should be cost effective,” Mr. Prasannan said. Either way he doubts whether there will be enough water for round-the-clock pumping due to three factors – indiscriminate usage of water, the usual 100-day period without rain in the State annually, and loss of water to evaporation.

K.K. Sajeevan, district officer at the Mining and Geology Department felt that proposal was feasible considering the abundance of unused quarries in the district.

“Once a quarry is fully explored and turns waterlogged, a contact is established with groundwater. Naturally, the water level rises sustaining enough water even during the summer,” he said.",2012-12-21 08:00:00+00:00,"['collected', 'goahead', 'growing', 'thirst', 'water', 'areas', 'quarries', 'treatment', 'abandoned', 'technology', 'quarry', 'sourcing', 'district', 'slake', 'proposal']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
571,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Water as a Tool of War: Qaddafi Loyalists Turn Off Tap for Half of Libya - Circle of Blue WaterNews,https://www.circleofblue.org/2011/world/water-as-a-tool-of-war-qaddafi-loyalists-turn-off-tap-for-half-of-libya/,"Muammar Qaddafi’s great achievement of tapping desert aquifers and sending the water hundreds of kilometers to Tripoli, the capital, and other coastal cities is now the focal point for sabotage and siege. Aid agencies have begun humanitarian relief as rebel leaders try to gain control of water-producing regions.

Libyan forces loyal to Qaddafi have taken control of the operation center that supplies Tripoli with water from the Great Manmade River — the 2,820-kilometer (1,752-mile) network of pipes, pumps, and storage tanks that Qaddafi began building in 1984 — according to yesterday’s report by The National, an English-language newspaper in the United Arab Emirates.

The western half of the country is now without running water, according to The National, and international organizations have initiated relief efforts in the Libyan capital. Power cuts have disrupted the pumps running the water supply. Qaddafi’s forces have attacked water operation centers and still control two cities that are essential to operating the system. There have also been rumors that Qaddafi’s supporters have poisoned a reservoir, according to The National.

“Our staff were terrorized,” said Abdussalam Jehawi, a board member of the Great Manmade River Authority in Benghazi. The loyalists “stole their four-wheel drive vehicles, used machine guns, took all their food,” he told The National.

A back-up operations center in the eastern city of Sirte is also beyond reach. Sirte, Qaddafi’s hometown, is one of the few cities still held by troops loyal to the deposed leader.

A member of the rebel National Transitional Council told the Sydney Morning-Herald that the council was still trying to gain control over much of the country’s remote, rural southern region. He did not know of any plans for how to secure water supplies and oil facilities in that region.

The European Union has allocated $US 16 million for humanitarian needs. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) delivered some 113,000 bottles of water to Tripoli in the last week and is preparing to deliver 5 million liters (1.3 million gallons) by truck and tanker from sources in neighboring countries. An aid organization from the island country of Malta is sending a ship with 300,000 liters (80,000 gallons) of bulk water and 50,000 liters (13,000 gallons) of bottled water.

“UNICEF is responding to the immediate needs in Tripoli, but we remain extremely concerned about the situation, should there be a shortage of water in the coming days,” said Christian Balslev-Olesen, the head of UNICEF’s Libyan office, in a press statement. “This could turn into an unprecedented health epidemic.”

A UNICEF team is currently exploring alternative water supply wells within Libya.

The Great Manmade River provides billions of liters of water a day from 1,300 wells in the Sahara. Because substantial amounts of electricity are needed to move the water through the system, power cuts during the revolution have periodically put the water supply at risk.

Last week, during the first day of fighting in Tripoli, an 18-hour power outage cut new water supplies from flowing to the capital, The National reported. Now that they control most of the capital, the rebels are shifting their focus to the areas that regulate the water supply.

“This could be taken care of soon, if Sabha and Sirte are taken by the rebels,” Jehawi, the river authority board member, told The National. “Until then, there is not much we can do.”

Sabha, near the main water source for the Tripoli line of the Great Manmade River, is likely the last stronghold for Qaddafi, rebel leaders told Reuters.

Opposition forces have been fighting the Qaddafi regime since early this year, as waves of revolutionary action have rippled throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Last week, the Libyan rebels seized control of the capital for the first time.

752,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Ramses II—facts and information - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/ramses-ii,"What makes a king mighty? Ramses II (ca 1303–ca 1213 B.C.) recognized that diplomacy and an exhaustive public relations campaign could mitigate any military shortcomings. His celebrated building accomplishments, including the marvels at Karnak and Abu Simbel, reflected his vision of a great nation and of himself as the “ruler of rulers.” He erected more monuments and statues—and sired more children—than any other pharaoh. As a result, he has long been regarded by Egyptians as Ramses the Great and his 66-year reign is considered to be the height of Egypt’s power and glory.



Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

It was Ramses II’s grandfather—Ramses I—who had elevated their commoner family to the ranks of royalty through his military prowess. Ramses II’s father, Seti I, secured the nation’s wealth by opening mines and quarries. He also fortified the northern frontier against the Hittites, a tribe out of modern-day Turkey. When 14-year-old Ramses II ascended the throne, the Hittites saw an opportunity to test the young king and his empire’s northern border. They invaded and took over the important trading town of Kadesh in modern-day Syria.



Ramses II led his forces to recapture Kadesh, but he was duped by spies into thinking the Hittites were far from the Egyptian camp. Instead, they were lying in wait nearby and attacked. The Egyptians were on the brink of defeat when reinforcements arrived just in the nick of time. Ramses II won that battle but he did not win the war. (Was Ramses II the Pharoah who challenged Moses?)



5:58

His battered troops withdrew from Kadesh, but Ramses wasn’t about to let a little truth tarnish his perceived triumph. On temple walls across Egypt, he ordered the creation of murals depicting him single-handedly defeating the aggressors. In reality, after years of negotiation, Ramses II eventually signed a peace treaty with the Hittites. It was the earliest peace accord whose text has survived. Among its articles, both sides agreed to extradite refugees and not exact retribution after their return. Further, they agreed to aid one another if attacked by foreign or domestic enemies. One copy of the treaty, in hieroglyphics, was carved on a stela in the temple of Karnak. A second copy, written in Akkadian on a clay tablet, was discovered in Turkey in 1906. The significance of this peace treaty is reflected in the fact that a replica of the tablet is on display at the United Nations headquarters in New York.

LIVING UP TO HIS GREATNESS



As a sign of diplomatic good faith, Ramses II married the eldest daughter of the Hittite king. She joined him, Nefertari (his chief queen), and his enormous family—he sired more than a hundred children—at his new capital, Per Ramessu, aptly, though audaciously, named after himself. (See inside the wedding of Ramses II and the Hittite princess.)



The wealth of Ramses II’s reign is evident in his opulent building campaign, the largest undertaken by any pharaoh. The temples at Karnak and Abu Simbel are among Egypt’s greatest wonders. His funerary temple, the Ramesseum, contained a massive library of some 10,000 papyrus scrolls. He honored both his father and himself by completing temples at Abydos.



For all of Ramses II’s efforts to ensure his legacy would live on, there was one testament to his power he could not have foreseen. After his death, nine subsequent pharaohs took his name upon ascending the throne, solidifying his stature as “the great” among Egypt’s rulers. (Read why the mummy of Ramses II was issued a modern passport.)

Abu Simbel, monumental temple Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. An elevated view of the Ramses temple and the Nile shoreline. Photograph by David Boyer, Nat Geo Image Collection Ramses II wanted there to be absolutely no question which pharaoh had built the magnificent temple at Abu Simbel. At its entrance, four 60-plus-foot-tall seated statues of him serve as sentries. Dedicated to the sun gods, the temple extends 185 feet into its cliff via a series of three towering halls. Scenes depict Ramses II at the Battle of Kadesh as well as the pharaoh and his principal wife, Nefertari, making offerings to the sun gods. Ramses ordered a second, smaller temple built nearby for Nefertari.



Because of its remote location, Abu Simbel went undiscovered until 1813. In 1959, when the construction of the Aswan High Dam threatened to flood the site, UNESCO embarked on an unprecedented, 20-year rescue effort that relocated both Abu Simbel temples—stone by stone—to higher ground some 200 feet farther up the cliff.



Prince Khaemwaset Among the more than 100-plus offspring of Ramses II, Prince Khaemwaset truly stands apart. He held the prestigious post of high priest of Ptah, the patron god of Memphis. Bas-reliefs depict him in his important duty of tending the tomb of Ptah’s sacred Apis bulls in the underground complex known as the Serapeum. Khaemwaset’s larger legacy is his groundbreaking role as one of the first known archaeologists. He was entranced by the thousand-year-old landmarks from the Old Kingdom that surrounded him in Memphis. He inspected and restored several temples and pyramids. At each restoration, he inscribed the names and titles of the building’s original “owners,” as well as his and his father’s names. A millennium after his death, he was revered as a scholar and featured in a series of stories about his accomplishments.

The fate of Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah is set to be decided by Monday after failing to end the country’s trophy drought at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.



The Ghana FA Normalisation Committee is expected to submit its reports to the Sport Ministry today on the team’s disappointing campaign in Egypt.



The Black Stars exited the continental showpiece at the round of 16 stage at the hands of Tunisia.



The last 16 elimination is the country’s worst performance in the tournament since 2006.



In January this year, President of the committee Dr Kofi Amoah dropped hint that Appiah’s head would be on the chopping board if the Black Stars miss out on the trophy.



“Per the contract, if Kwesi Appiah doesn’t win the AFCON 2019 he is gone. This is stated in his contract,” Amoah was quoted as saying.



Coach Appiah still has a running contract which will expire in December.

Description of the disaster

On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The flood incident was caused by the intensity of the rainfalls at the peak of the flood season and the release of dams located in neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Benin, which resulted in the Benue and Niger rivers overflowing and affecting communities living along their banks and in surrounding areas. Table 1 illustrates the flood impacts of the worst flood affected states.

The situation in Kebbi  the country's biggest rice-producing state  is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), with the support from the Federal Government, is scaling efforts to assist flood victims by providing emergency needs. So far, the agency has distributed 30 canoes to inundated communities, as well as materials to build embankments to control the floods.

Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. At least three lives in Ilorin are believed to have been lost. Scores of houses also had their roofs blown off by the raging storm that accompanied the heavy rains in the Ilorin metropolis while electricity poles were destroyed in Taiwo and Odota areas of the state capital. Telecommunication masts and building walls were also damaged in Olonkonla, Bobonkiri, Egba-Akota, Aberi, Akuji and Idiope, all in Ita-Ogunbo area, Alanamu Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area, the worst hit.

Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of the those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the countrys six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigerias water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.

A government team began the delivery of food palliatives to the Kwara North Senatorial District, beginning with Jebba town in Moro Local Government Area and Lafiagi in Edu Local Government Area. Over 15,000 households across 357 communities of the state are estimated to have been affected by the ugly incidents that also destroyed farmlands and human dwellings worth billions of naira. In the wake of the floods, over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize and millet farms in Kpata-Gbaradogi, fishing and agrarian settlement in Pategi LGA were destroyed. About 100 residential buildings were also submerged while 1,500 people were rendered homeless.

The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, warned flood-prone states to prepare for flood emergency, rescue and rehabilitation. According to the Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) made public by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the rainy season is expected to continue until December 28th in the southern parts of the country. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), predicted that at least 102 LGAs in 28 states fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 275 LGAs in the 36 states of the Federation, including FCT, fall within the moderately probable flood risks areas.",2020-10-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['n', 'dref', 'affected', 'north', 'epoa', 'flood', 'local', 'floods', 'states', 'action', 'area', 'farmlands', 'plan', 'nigeria', 'state', 'mdrng030', 'areas', 'emergency']",Nigeria,news article,English
157,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Chirpy magpie robins - The Borneo Post,https://www.theborneopost.com/2012/11/18/chirpy-magpie-robins/,"MAGPIE robins hop along the forest floor, in gardens and cleared areas with their tails upright. These birds are one of the first the beginner photographer or birdwatcher can add to their life list; as the birds stop, scratch at the ground and search for hidden insects and other avian delicacies. Most prefer open forests and coastal areas.

The shamas, a shy bird, are usually spotted at twilight and dawn in primary and secondary forests. They are known for their long tails and melodious singing. They often imitate the sounds of other birds. The species is nearly extinct in Singapore because they are captured by greedy individuals and sold to the public as caged-songbirds. The birds are in major decline throughout the region because of the pet trade. They are purchased and live only a few months in captivity because the owners soon become bored and they are neglected.

Magpie robins and shamas are thought to have evolved in Southeast Asia from African relatives about 7.2 to 5.3 million years ago. How and why they arrived is not known but they are genetically closely related to their African, Middle Eastern and South Asian cousins.

Shamas

Once the shamas evolved, there are two possible scenarios for their further distribution on Southeast Asian islands. The varieties in the Philippines were the result of two invasions from Sundaland, the area that encompasses Indonesia to the Wallace Line and Malaysia. The first wave resulted in the white-browed shamas (Copsychus luzoniensis), an isolated population on the island of Luzon.

The second wave, from Borneo, landed on the islands of Palawan and Cebu. They eventually evolved into Copsychus niger and Copsychus cebuensis.

The second hypothesis on the distribution has the birds arriving very early, about 27 million years ago in the Philippines. From there, they diversified and re-invaded Sundaland via Borneo.

The white-rumped shama (Copsychus malabaricus) arrived and became isolated in eastern and western Sundaland. The Borneo variety morphed into two separate subspecies – the white-capped (Copsychus stricklandii) to the north and black-capped (Copsychus suavis) on the rest of the island.

Magpie robins

The magpie robins, as good dispensers, arrived from Africa en masse and populated the Indian Ocean and Sundaland. In the Philippines, they morphed into an all-black form (Copsychus mindanesis). Interestingly, they are not on the island of Palawan, maybe because of competition with the black shama (Copsychus niger).

The original birds of Borneo and Java were black-bellied while white-bellied types arose on Sumatera, the Malay Peninsula and the mainland. The black-bellied birds on Borneo further evolved into two subspecies, adamsi in Sabah and pluto on the rest of the island. There is a hybridisation zone in central Borneo where the black and white forms meet.

Refugia hypothesis

An idea came about in 1969 from Jurgen Hafferin describing a possible scenario on the rise of species and sub-species in the tropics. During the last ice age, the tropical rainforests were divided into islands by broad expanses of savannah and grasslands. This was because of a cooling and drying period. These isolated rainforests became known as refugia.

In each of these separated forests (refugia), the isolated flora and fauna became different, unable to move from one area to another and intermingle. As time passed, they evolved into separate sub-species and species. This occurrence has been used to explain the different orangutan subspecies as well as ant and rodent species among others.

However, the union of disparate land masses from low sea levels could also explain the spread of different species. Birds could fly over them stopping for food instead of over open water.

From Sumatera, the black-rumped shama (Copsychus suavis) could have spread east to Borneo meeting up with white-capped (Copsychus stricklandii). Remember, all the land was connected because the waters were tied up in ice. When the ice melted and warmer temperatures returned, the land bridges were flooded, returning to the familiar map of today.

A huge puzzle yet to be solved is why the lowland species of birds are different in Sabah and not on the rest of the island. For example, both the magpie robin (Copsychus saularis adamsi) and shama (Copsychus malabaricus stricklandii – possible separate species?) are found only in the north and nowhere else in the world.

The backyard gardener and amateur birder will get to know the magpie robins very quickly. They are familiar in most parts of open areas in Kuching. Our forest dwellers, the shamas, will require waking up a bit early or wandering around 7pm near the edge of the forest. Grab your binoculars and field guide and enjoy these birds that arrived from Africa many millions of years ago.

It's a Woody Allen movie so there's a lot of walking, talking, and walking. Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris. Gil (Owen Wilson, far right) grins and bears it as the insufferable Paul (Michael Sheen) bloviates on everything and nothing in Midnight in Paris.

Woody Allen returns to Europe for a film only Woody Allen fans will be charmed by. Elizabeth Kerr reports.

Woody Allen's latest European flight of fancy, the time traveling romantic comedy Midnight in Paris, follows the alleged renaissance the intensely New York director is having. On the heels of the generally well received Match Point (set in London) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (duh) comes Woody's fetishization of the City of Lights. In case you were wondering, he's in production on a film set and shot in Rome (The Bop Decameron, whatever that means). It seems no location in the old country is safe from Woody's neuroses and obnoxious alter egos.

Midnight in Paris is Allen's biggest commercial hit in over 20 years and now reigns as his all time box office winner. The buzz coming off its premiere at Cannes in May was universally positive, if not downright fawning. Saying Midnight in Paris is only a so-so endeavor, with plenty of ridiculousness and irritating Woodyisms in it is akin to blasphemy - kind of like saying Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 just wasn't that strong a film. In the world of Woody sycophancy choosing Owen Wilson to take up the Allen avatar is ""novel"" casting, not ""mis""-casting. The romanticization of Paris' lengthy artistic history is cleverly snarking at notions of what constitutes highbrow culture, not gleefully wallowing in them; heaven forbid you try to sit through the film without a crash course on World War I-era art history first. And as was the case with Allen's rendering of London and Barcelona, there's nary a ghetto or angry immigrant in sight.

Gil (Wilson) is a good-natured Hollywood hack (the ""hack"" part is Allen's so-called disguise), in Paris with his fiance Inez's (Rachel McAdams) parents. He's successful but has a hankering to write a novel - to be a ""real"" writer. Inez and her parents are dismissive at best, and Gil's obsession with the legacy of the Lost Generation gets on their nerves. While out strolling one night (there are lots of strolls along the Seine and through the city's cobbled arrondissements), as the clock strikes midnight, a vintage car rolls up, picks him up, and whisks him off to a party evidently raging in the 1920s. Cole Porter is playing the piano, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald socialize, and Ernest Hemingway broods in the corner. Eventually he meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard), an artist's muse who he bonds with instantly. Meanwhile back in 2011, Inez is star struck by an arrogant Man Of The World, Paul (Michael Sheen), though she carries on with snobby wedding plans.

Yet another late-night stroll through the arrondissement of Paris sees temporally displaced Adriana (Marion Cotillard) falling for Gil (Owen Wilson) in Midnight in Paris.

There are some interesting ideas lurking beneath the surface here, chiefly the power of nostalgia to cloud our perceptions and the cyclical nature of that nostalgic glow. How many times have you heard the phrase, ""Popular music just isn't as good as it was in the '60s/'70s/'80s,"" lately? Give it some time. The '90s will have its turn soon. How about, ""Movies are all special effects now""? Gil's rose-colored glasses perception of the fecund 1920s is mirrored by Adriana's view of the previous ""great moment,"" the Belle poque. No doubt, there are Allen fans out there pining for the days of Annie Hall and Interiors. There's an understated melancholy for days gone by - in Paris and likely in Allen's native New York - that deserved more attention. The Paris that Gil is so fond of doesn't exist, as Inez reminds him time and again, and that sense of grand loss informs the narrative, giving it what little thematic heft it has. It even flirts with Allen acknowledging his own penchant for wistful backwards glances.

But Midnight in Paris is one part romantic comedy of sorts, though with Wilson in the lead it's only vaguely romantic, and with the exception of a few choice bit parts, rarely funny. Of the cabal of Lost Generation giants that make appearances in the film, Corey Stoll in a rip-roaringly macho, dour, and hilariously literary turn as Hemingway stands out, as does Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. Perhaps, though, the high point of the film comes courtesy Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. The single scene in which the Spanish surrealist fixates on a rhinoceros is outr art comedy at its finest. This guy deserves a film of his own, just not one by Woody Allen.

As should be expected with an Allen film, the women characters leave a lot to be desired: Inez is ostensibly there to act as the foil that pushes Gil toward his destiny but to do so she had to be shrewish, shallow, and unsupportive. Inez has no redeeming qualities that would hint at why Gil went out with her a second time, never mind proposed marriage; Adriana's ""job"" is professional adoring girlfriend of artistic geniuses; a classy art gallery guide (Carla Bruni) is a tool for Gil to vindicate himself with; and a young antique dealer, Gabrielle (La Seydoux), proves to be the girl of his dreams when she repeats - word for word - Gil's feelings on Paris in the rain. The common bond between them? They're hot and they all desperately want Gil. This is only a few steps away from porn logic - which is at least honest about its male fantasy.

Like Match Point (Tate galleries at every turn and rolling countryside perfect for fox hunts) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (fiery Spanish lovers sitting at charming cafs drinking wine), Midnight in Paris has a travelogue tone that never becomes to threatening, or steers too far from lushly photographed landmark set pieces (Look!

Whatever it is that has inspired Allen's diversion from what he knows best (Manhattan) remains a mystery, but after three major films it's clear Allen's brand of neurotic inertia doesn't transplant to Europe very well. Had Allen taken a stab at dismantling that perception of European laissez faire existentialism, he might have been on to something. But he didn't. Make your wagers now for how many shots the Colosseum will make it into - with excitable, hand-talking Italians walking by - in Allen's next European foray.

52,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Conflict drives 'unacceptable' figure of 795 million people facing hunger - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/12/conflict-drives-unacceptable-figure-of-795-million-people-facing-hunger,"Levels of hunger in the developing world have fallen by nearly one third since the turn of the century but an “unacceptably high” number of people still do not have enough food to eat, largely because of the spread of armed conflicts, this year’s global hunger index has warned.

There are 27% fewer hungry people in the world today than at the turn of the century, according to the 2015 index, which was released on Monday by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide.

But despite this progress, “the level of hunger in the world remains unacceptably high, with 795 million people still going hungry, more than one in four children affected by stunting, and 9% of children affected by wasting”, the index said.



The index assessed the level of hunger in 117 countries where the issue is considered to be a problem and where data is available. It takes into account undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and child mortality.

There are “serious” concerns about the level of hunger in 44 countries and “alarming” signs in eight other nations, the index said.

Armed conflict, which has cut civilians off from food supplies, is behind high levels of hunger in Central African Republic, which ranked bottom of this year’s index, according to Dominic MacSorley, CEO of Concern Worldwide.



“You can contrast where there has been progress and go to Ethiopia and Rwanda, where the hunger levels have fallen substantially,” MacSorley said.

Conflicts have become more deadly since 2008. Despite the number of active wars falling from 63 in 2008 to 42 in 2014, the number of people killed in conflict areas has soared from 56,000 to 180,000 over the same period.

These intensifying wars are driving hunger in some of the world’s poorest countries, MacSorley said. Hostilities often drive civilians to deplete food stocks, making them more vulnerable to future food insecurity.

“Preventing civilian access to food markets, food production and/or food aid is the equivalent of using hunger as a weapon and is therefore a direct violation of human rights and international humanitarian law,” said Jean-Michel Grand, executive director of Action Against Hunger UK, an international NGO.



Many of the countries affected by the most violent conflicts in the world today – including Syria, South Sudan and Somalia – did not have enough data on hunger to be included in this year’s index. In total, 13 countries had to be omitted from the index because of a lack of available data.

In September, world leaders committed to the wide-ranging sustainable development goals (SDGs), which aim to end extreme poverty, address the impact of climate change and reduce inequality by 2030. SDG2, the second goal, seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture over the same period.

MacSorley said: “Without peace, ending poverty and hunger by 2030 will never be achieved. The time has come for the international community to make conflict prevention, mitigation and resolution a far higher political priority.”



But humanitarians are optimistic that the world can make progress towards meeting SDG2.



Shenggen Fan, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, said: “We are more confident today than ever before that we can end hunger, provided we do not rest on our accomplishments.”



Grand said: “If world leaders are serious about fulfilling their ambitions to end hunger and malnutrition by 2030, as stated at the sustainable development summit held less than a month ago at the UN general assembly in New York, then they must start by launching meaningful peace processes in war-torn countries where millions of people are denied access to food markets, food production and/or food aid.”

Last year’s index warned that widespread consumption of poor-quality food, dubbed “hidden hunger”, is affecting two billion people.

The 2015 index includes data on child stunting and child wasting instead of just on the number of underweight children in a given country. This provides “more accurate information on undernutrition, enabling better humanitarian programming decisions to be made”, Grand said.",2015-10-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['million', 'conflict', 'figure', 'facing', 'international', 'world', 'food', 'number', 'child', 'drives', 'unacceptable', 'end', '795', 'hunger', 'index', 'countries', 'wasting']",Somalia,news article,English

Severe flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rains in the central region have left at least 29 people dead and 12 others missing. The entire region was battered by torrential downpours since last Tuesday after a cold spell came in contact with tropical turbulence. The turbulence intensified into a tropical depression and then into Storm Linfa, which made landfall Sunday over the provinces of Quang Ngai and Quang Nam, the latter home to Hoi An.

57,DR-2015-000134-SOM,The Key to Ending Global Hunger Is on the Battlefield - TakePart,http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/10/15/global-hunger-war,"When the United Nations announced new goals for reducing global food waste last month, the plan was couched in terms of helping those who don’t have enough to eat. By limiting the amount of food we throw away, the idea goes, we can limit the amount of people who are hungry too. But according to this year’s Global Hunger Index, which was published Wednesday by the International Food Policy Research Institute, to eradicate global hunger for good, we may need to work a little harder to achieve world peace.

The kind of “calamitous famines” that kill more than 1 million people “have vanished,” according to an essay by Alex de Waal, executive director of the World Peace Program, included in the report. “The end of the Cold War, the adoption of international human rights norms, and the rise of globalization” are key factors that allowed the elimination of massive famine, he wrote. But all is not rosy in the world. Just because governments can no longer easily starve an entire population without the world knowing about it does not mean all nonnatural famine (as in the case of drought or other natural disaster) has been eradicated. “When famine or acute hunger occurs today, it is usually the result of armed conflict,” de Waal added.

Between 1970 and 1997, agricultural losses owing to conflict averaged $4.3 billion annually, according to the report, “exceeding the value of food aid to these countries.”

In the past, governments have regularly used hunger as a weapon. “Scorched earth” campaigns—when an army burns or otherwise ruins natural resources or food—have been used by armies since ancient times. Herbicidal weaponry such as the Agent Orange the U.S. used in the Vietnam War caused not only a loss of agricultural crops but also topsoil damage that led to flooding. In 1977, the Geneva Convention banned the practice of harming civilians either directly or through destroying necessary resources, though that has not entirely stopped the practice.

But a conflict doesn’t have to directly raze farmland to decrease food security. As the FAO has noted, this doesn’t make the impact on life less severe. War can harm more people through hunger and malnutrition than direct violence can. A report by the Wilson Center showed that, on average, peacetime production levels were 12.3 percent higher than during conflict periods—though in some countries the difference was as high as 44 percent.

RELATED: TakePart World and Global Citizen Present: Nutrition

However, tactical starvation is often over faster than in decades past. De Waal gives the example of the Israeli siege of Gaza, which “involved tight control of basic supplies to the territory.” While this caused “extreme” deprivation, it “stopped short of crossing the line into mass starvation.” In the history of warfare, this counts as progress.

In the last 15 years, Global Hunger Index scores have dropped by 27 percent overall. The number is calculated by looking at the percentage of the population that is undernourished and the percentage of children under five who suffer from stunting or wasting or who die before reaching that age. Not all countries had this data to draw on, including places with recently recorded high levels of hunger, such as Somalia, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As a result, the true global effects of hunger may be higher.

While conflict can cause starvation, hunger can spark violence too. The catalyst for 2011’s Arab Spring was a sudden rise in food prices after the government reduced bread subsidies. Natural disasters that lead to difficulty accessing or purchasing basic food supplies can also “contribute to political unrest,” the FAO noted in its 2015 report on food insecurity. Syria’s civil war in particular has been linked to a drought that ravished the country’s farmland.

Similarly, the peacetime eradication of malnutrition and hunger may make conflict less likely in the future. Luckily, there is lower hanging fruit than creating world peace. The IFPRI report shows that the area of Africa south of the Sahara has the highest levels of hunger. Some of the countries in this area have experienced periods of relative economic growth, while others are still recovering from recent conflict. One thing these countries have in common is that “more than two-thirds of the region’s population relies on agriculture for income, including more than 90 percent of the region’s extreme poor,” according to the report. Despite the large numbers of people participating in farming, productivity is low.

It may still be easier to attempt to help farmers increase productivity than try to ensure conflict never returns to these areas. As many studies have noted, it’s easier to keep peace in a region that’s prospering.",2015-10-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['conflict', 'war', 'world', 'food', 'report', 'key', 'global', 'battlefield', 'hunger', 'countries', 'waal', 'according', 'ending']",Somalia,news article,English
1077,FL-2017-000017-PAK,A glacial disaster in the making - The News International,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/838236-a-glacial-disaster-in-the-making,"On August 15, 2020, a teenage girl was killed in a remote village in Chitral as a glacial flood swept away six houses, partially damaging sixteen others and inundating standing crops of wheat and beans. Another 11 people were injured as the local police station and a post of Chitral Scouts were submerged. The glacial flood washed away a stretch of more than 500 meters of road to Baroghil valley as well.

Fast-forward to February 28, 2021 and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issues a GLOF (glacial lake outburst flood) warning on the Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers in Hunza. The situation is still developing and a potential GLOF event is expected in May-June 2021 which will put the population in the downstream community of Hassanabad village at risk of glacial flooding. The Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers have a history of flash flooding. The current surge of Shishper, a 25 sq kms glacier in size, has brought its snout as close as four km from the Karakoram highway, a critical route for the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) initiative in the region.

This is the new normal in the everyday life of these remote and impoverished mountain communities. Recurring loss of life, property and livelihood due to natural catastrophes, associated primarily with the changing climate in the region, is only aggravating with every passing year. Even worse, these climatic changes are altering weather patterns in the long term, which are not properly understood by these local communities. Though climate-induced changes encompass a wide range of pressing issues, water is arguably the most essential natural resource at risk.

Pakistan is a unique place: the country hosts 7,200+ glaciers in its North, spread over approximately 17,000 sq km, which is home to the mighty Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) mountain ranges. It has reportedly more glacial ice than anywhere on earth outside the polar regions  hence referred to as the third pole. These glaciers feed the rivers that account for around 75 percent of the stored-water supply in a country inhabited by 212+ million people.

Ironically, Pakistan contributes less than one percent to global pollutant emissions, which ranks it among the least emitters. Yet, the country is among the most vulnerable to climate-related hazards like changing monsoon patterns, rapid glacial ice melt leading to inundation and flash flooding, avalanches, landslides and extreme heatwaves. Consequently, climate-induced migration by the local population in mountain and downstream communities of this region to save lives and to look for better livelihood opportunities is a serious challenge. This is the real evidence of the direct human cost of climate change in this part of the world.

Glaciers are a source of freshwater and vital for the ecosystem. As a consequence of climate change and global warming, several glaciers around the world are shrinking in size and gradually retreating. Depending on the volume and size of the glacial lake, temperature and precipitation, and geomorphological parameters of the terrain, mechanical failures may cause a breach in the wall of an ice or moraine-dammed glacial lake. Subsequently, a sudden discharge of millions of cubic meters of meltwater and debris can occur in a short time, with a catastrophic impact on the socioeconomic life of the downstream communities. This phenomenon is referred to as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods or GLOFs.

These GLOFs are a major hazard in high altitude glaciated regions of northern Pakistan. According to a UNDP report, around 3,033 glacial lakes have been identified in this region, with at least 33 critical lakes. Many recent scientific studies are projecting an increase in the frequency of GLOFs in the wake of ongoing climate change and global warming. The government of Pakistan's National Climate Change Policy identifies the projected recession of HKH glaciers as a major climate threat, while a key finding of the Asian Development Bank, reported in 2017, is the lack of glacier monitoring infrastructure in Pakistan.

Most of the glaciers in Pakistan are at low altitude and the settlements are near the glaciers. This makes them more vulnerable. Dr Arun Bhakta Shrestha, the regional programme manager for River Basins & Cryosphere at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, has emphasized that even if the GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions are reduced to limit the temperature rise as envisioned in the Paris Agreement, a scenario with only a two degree Celsius could still be devastating as two-third of glaciers in the HKH would melt away!

Mitigative measures at local, national and international levels in a coherent manner are immediate imperatives. Mountain and downstream communities settled in these disaster-prone areas are unceasingly at risk and their vulnerabilities are augmented by poverty, lack of awareness about the GLOF threats, increasing pressure on natural resources, and high-risk settlement patterns. At the local level, adaptation to climate change and resilience building through specific initiatives  early warning systems, promotion of clean energy in the mountains, reducing deforestation and land-use regulation  must be enforced. In a country like Pakistan, which lacks essential infrastructure for glacier monitoring, disaster management policies, risk reduction plans, early warning systems and scientific approach and equipment to deal with the new risks and vulnerabilities arising from its natural resources, it is imperative that the international community must come forward and help.

At the moment, the government of Pakistan, through the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC), and UNDP Pakistan are implementing a $37 million project named Scaling Up of GLOF Risk Reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II), a continuation of the GLOF-I pilot project, which aims to empower communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs. This project is expanding weather information surveillance by installing 50 automatic weather stations at different locations in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. Though these weather stations will provide information as part of a local-level early warning system, they are limited in scope and scalability for now.

The glaciated region of HKH is vast and stretches over thousands of kilometres across several countries. This third pole necessitates more engagement of the international community through development of local infrastructure, investment in building community resilience, prevention of deforestation, reduction in GHG emissions, application of scientific approach, tools and methods in their study, risk assessment and reduction planning at the regional level, continuous monitoring and integrated analysis of the evolution of glaciers.

The recent summit by US President Biden has made some headway, but there is a real urgency for stronger climate action, limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as proposed in the Paris Agreement, helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts and discussing opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change.

Climate change doesnt seem to recognize our borders on land and water, and Mother Nature is ruthless when it comes to punishing. Efforts beyond borders, strategic alliances and politics are essential and only an all-inclusive approach can yield desired results.

1157,FL-2017-000155-VNM,We must not repeat the Vietnam refugee tragedy in Afghanistan - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2021/05/18/we-must-not-repeat-the-vietnam-refugee-tragedy-in-afghanistan/,"The parallel between the Vietnam War and Afghan War is troubling. In both cases, the U.S. became involved in a foreign war without having a clear picture of what our ultimate objective was. We largely took over the direction of each war from a corrupt host government. Many citizens of our host country placed reliance on the U.S. to provide for their safety, come what may. The war became unwinnable because of a series of unfortunate decisions. Losing interest in the endeavor, we shaped settlement terms the host government was required to accept, intimating we would be there to help if worse came to worst. Here, the similarity ends, for now.

In the case of Vietnam, even though we knew weeks beforehand that the fall of South Vietnam was imminent, we made no concerted effort to extract the Vietnamese who had steadfastly supported the U.S. When their government fell, many thousands who had helped, trusted and relied upon us were murdered or incarcerated to the great dishonor of our nation. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the south and, although we gave many of them sanctuary, our help was slow in coming. The final chapter in Afghanistan has yet to be written, but it must not end up with a betrayal of our friends.

During the long and tortured course of Americas war in Afghanistan, many Afghans stepped forward at their great peril to serve and help protect our military personnel. As we withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban have stepped up their violent attacks and the danger to our friends has dramatically increased. We are morally obligated to provide them sanctuary within our borders.

There are two special immigrant visa (SIV) programs in place to bring our Afghan friends to the U.S., but they are mired in red tape  it takes up to three years to process an application. There is a backlog of nearly 19,000 SIV applicants, with about 50,000 family members. They are waiting in line, living in fear of death. There are not enough slots to take care of the backlog. The vetting process is understaffed, underfunded and overly burdensome.

In this crisis situation, there are two feasible alternatives  either review existing documentation in the files and grant visas to those who U.S. personnel have credibly vouched for in the files, or extract the SIVs and families from Afghanistan and complete any necessary vetting in a safe location. We processed South Vietnamese refugees at U.S. military bases in the late 1980s.

We need, also, to consider the plight of Afghans who dont qualify for SIV status. A Taliban take-over, which appears increasingly likely, will create a flood of refugees, fleeing for their very lives. Being partially responsible for their plight, we are honor bound to provide sanctuary for many of them, just as we eventually did for those fleeing Vietnam. We should plan to evacuate Afghans who will be targets of Taliban reprisal  uncorrupted government and military officials, womens rights advocates, educators, democracy advocates and the like.

Like many troops who served in Americas wars, this issue is very personal for me. I lived and worked with South Vietnamese soldiers in 1968-1969. I trusted them with my life, while they relied on the U.S. government as a friend and ally. Most of my Vietnamese friends were Catholics who moved from North Vietnam to Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam in 1954 to escape persecution. They were fiercely anti-communist and pro-American. It broke my heart when the communists took over in April 1975, knowing that my friends would be killed or imprisoned, as were many thousands of their countrymen. We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate. We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us.

Seeks Reinstatement As V.c - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907240528.html,"There was pandemonium yesterday at the Winneba Campus of the University of Education, Winneba (UEW), when Professor Mawutor Avoke, former Vice-Chancellor, stormed the campus seeking reinstatement as Vice-Chancellor (V.C).

According to him, his decision followed his clearance by the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) after he was indicted for abusing his office.

""EOCO after a thorough probe concluded in black and white that we did not abuse our office or were involved in any procurement breaches. We are back to take over our respective offices and right place in the school,"" Prof Avoke said.

Speaking at a press conference, which was monitored by Ghanaian Times in the council chamber of the university in the company of the five dismissed staff, Prof. Avoke said he was prepared to work with all stakeholders of the university to bring about peace when he assumes the position of Vice-Chancellor again.

""I have already made moves towards building peace in the school that has been marred in controversy for the past two years. I urge all on the opposite side to consider the greater needs of the university and accept my peace-building efforts,"" he stated.

Although the Police initially resisted the idea of the press conference on the campus, Prof. Avoke and the other dismissed staff had access to the university and insisted that he would take over the running of the university from today.

This comes just hours after Kinsgley Amoakwah, Chairman, Senior Staff Association of the university, filed an application at the High Court demanding Prof. Avoke's reinstatement as Vice-Chancellor.

He also want the court to issue an order restraining Professor Anthony Afful-Broni from holding himself as the Vice-Chancellor or performing any such functions in that capacity of the UEW.

He also wants an order preventing Prof. Afful-Broni from ""continuously interfering with the administration of Prof. Mawutor Avoke,"" whom he claims was the legitimate Vice-Chancellor of the university.

The suit further was ""an order restraining Prof. Afful-Broni, his assigns, agents, or any person claiming through him from walking or driving within the precincts of the Main Administration Block of UEW, where Prof. Avoke's office is located.""

Prof. Avoke was ordered to step aside in 2017 by the Winneba High Court until a case brought against him and the University's Governing Council was determined.

'I am not afraid to speak out' � Meet Mr Samuel Bailey, one of Jamaica's top older activists

Last week I had the honour of meeting one of our Age Demands Action (ADA) champions, Mr Samuel Bailey from Jamaica.

The 69-year-old father-of-six is a retired supermarket worker and was a trade union officer. Now he is a president of a secondary school and an advocate for orphaned children and older people.

He has been an active campaigner for Age Demands Action for several years and this year on 1 October, the UN International Day of Older Persons, he was among a delegation of older people that met Jamaica's Minister of Health and Minister of Labour and Social Security.

The group asked the politicians about the possibility of establishing health clinics for older people so that they can have easier access to health care services, access to micro-credit for older people and the possibility of a universal pension.

Samuel kindly let me interview him about being a people's champion.

When did you first take part in the Age Demands Action campaign?

About four years ago. I was introduced to the campaign through Hope for Children charity in Jamaica. Mr Jeffrey James, the regional director for HelpAge Caribbean, saw me and asked me whether I would consider being an advocate for older people.

How does it feel to meet governments and represent the voices of older people?

You see, I am not afraid to speak, I am not shy and I am not nervous. I met the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and I also spoke to the Minister of National Security about violence against older people and the discrimination they face.

For example when you go to the bank to borrow money to raise chickens, the bank is reluctant to give you a loan because if you are 70 or older they think you will die soon.

You have a lot of verbal and physical abuse in Jamaica. Older people want respect and recognition. We have built the government, and we need people to recognise this. The Minister was very impressed and he said he will see what he can do.

Do you think governments are making improvements to older people thanks to ADA?

We do get good things from governments. For example thanks to advocacy, older people get bus pass discounts. We also have hospital cards which gives you half price off medicines. However we need a special day for older people to see doctors and we need a special window for older people to get medication. In rural areas we want mobile medication services, where older people can get free medication so senior citizens can access medicines.

Why do you think older people's rights are important?

Older people contributed to the country as civil servants, lawyers and doctors. Even those who were not academics, even if people were garbage collectors, they helped to build this country. Because of their contribution, they are entitled to enjoy their later lives.

Do you think young people should be involved in the campaign? Why?

Yes! We involve young people in our work. I speak to young people and tell them that anything we achieve for older people will make life easier for them later when they get old. So they must be with us. Young people volunteer with us, for example they will cook Christmas dinner and soup for us. They also play sports with us. We welcome them so we have to get them involved in our activities. Some school children join our activities and learn about their grandparents concerns.

What message do you have for older people like you?

Keep on doing what you are doing and you will continue to be blessed. I am praying that God will give the strength to advocate for older people's rights.

Joshimath, Uttarakhand – On Sunday morning, Rishi Prasad, 57, ran as fast as he could to save his son but he could reach the tunnel where his son was, massive boulders, trees and mud had already blocked its entrance.

Abhishek Panth, 24, was working in an under-construction tunnel near Tapovan Dam, at the confluence of Dhauliganga and Rishiganga Rivers – in Chamoli district about 280km (173 miles) east of Dehradun, capital of the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand.

Panth is among the dozens of people still trapped inside the 2km (1.24-mile) long tunnel, Aparna Kumar of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), which is a part of the rescue operations, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday.

The tunnel is part of the multimillion-dollar, 520-megawatt Tapovan hydroelectric project, one of the two dam projects destroyed on Sunday by a deadly flash flood triggered by a Himalayan glacial burst, which has claimed at least 31 lives so far while some 175 others are missing, according to the Uttarakhand State Disaster Response Fund.

His wife has not spoken since; she lies on a bed with relatives sitting around her, hoping those trapped inside the tunnel are alive.

“I don’t know whether my son is alive or dead,” Prasad told Al Jazeera. “It’s been more than 50 hours now, but the administration has not been able to clear the tunnel.”

Meanwhile, the Rishi Ganga hydel project near Raini village, almost six kilometres from Tapovan Dam, has been completely washed away by the floods caused by the glacier burst.

Officials say over 40 people, who were working at the power station, are either trapped under the debris or have been washed away by the waters. However, relatives of the victims say that the number could be as high as 50.

“The height of water at this location was around 100 meters and one can very well imagine the velocity and impact of that water,” said Ashu Singh Rathore, chief engineer with the Border Roads Organisation – which is carrying out the rescue operation at the site along with teams of NDRF and security forces.

Four bodies were recovered at the site earlier in the day.

‘Not seen such a scene in our lives’

Hundreds of rescue workers, including Indian army personnel, are scouring muck-filled ravines and valleys, looking for survivors at several sites, including the tunnel.

The sounds of choppers and military helicopters making rounds to assist the rescue efforts fill the air.

Balvir Singh Rawat, 32, who runs a shop in Tapovan village, told Al Jazeera that at about 10:30am (05:00 GMT) on Sunday, he heard a loud bang.

Balvir Singh Rawat runs a shop in Tapovan village [Bilal Kuchay/Al Jazeera] “We thought the whole mountain had broken down,” he said.

“After five minutes, we looked at the river. There was no water but big boulders, trees and mud moving and its level only rising and rising. We had not seen such a scene in our lives.”

Darshan Singh, 58, who runs a tea stall in the same village, adds: “We thought this is our end.”

Singh, who lives in the neighbouring village of Bangool on the other side of the Dhauliganga river, is trapped in Topavan as the bridge over the river has been washed away.

“I don’t know for how many days I will have to stay in Topavan but I’m happy that my family members are safe,” he said.

ITBP’s Kumar said 13 villages are cut off after the flood washed away their bridges.

The damaged Tapovan hydroelectric project [Bilal Kuchay/Al Jazeera] Narendra Lal, 46, worked as a mason at the dam for the past five years. His body was fished out from the river on Sunday night.

Lal is survived by his elderly mother, wife and four children; he was the family’s only breadwinner.

On Tuesday afternoon, dozens of villagers assembled at his modest house on a hill in Topavan to demand that the family be given not only a one-time compensation announced by the government but also a monthly fund to run the household.

Lal’s neighbour Mohan Bajwal asked why he was working on a Sunday when most offices were shut for the weekly holiday.

“Had the company not kept its office open on Sunday, so many people would have been alive today,” he told Al Jazeera.

‘Want this project closed once and for all’

Ram Kishan lost his wife Sarojni Devi and daughter Anjana Semwal, 18, after they were swept away while cutting grass near the river on Sunday. Their bodies have still not been found.

The 52-year-old blamed the hydroelectric projects for the glacier breaking. He told Al Jazeera that the blasting undertaken for the construction had damaged his house and has now taken away two members of his family.

“We are poor people and can’t fight these big corporations but I want this project to be closed once and for all. This is not for our betterment. This is our destruction” he said.

Kishan’s younger daughter Sanjana, 16, told Al Jazeera that she wants to see her mother and sister and for them to have a proper funeral.

“My only appeal to the government is to find my mother and sister.”

The Himalayan state of Uttarakhand is prone to flash floods and landslides. Sunday’s disaster has prompted calls by environmental groups for a review of power projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains.

“In order to construct these hydropower projects, dams and roads, massive blasting was done in these mountains and this is what we see now,” said Om Prakash, 39, a local from Topavan.

Prakash told Al Jazeera the local residents had protested against the projects when they were announced. “But nobody listened to us. Now, here is the result,” he said.

“Our fears are now turning into a reality.”

Appeals to do more

Families of the victims at the Rishi Ganga hydel project allege that the authorities are not doing enough to find their loved ones.

“There are just three machines clearing the debris here and two out of them are primarily there for the road connectivity. The administration is not bothered that almost 50 people are trapped inside this debris,” said Shabir Ahmad Zargar, whose brother Basharat Ahmad was working at the power project and is missing since Sunday.

Ahmad, a resident of Srinagar in the Indian Administered Kashmir was working as General manager at the power project, according to his family.

Rathore of the Border Roads Organisation told Al Jazeera that his organisation’s primary job is to connect disconnected villages with the rest of the state after the flood water washed away the bridge near Raini village.

“We are basically here for connectivity purpose but at the same time on the request of the local administration, our one machine is working where the people are trapped that is why we have been able to recover four bodies today and we are going very slow because any kind of body if we recover, it has to be recovered safely,” he said.

DURHAM, England (AP) — A World Cup semifinal spot seems a long way off for a Sri Lanka lineup that lost its captain on the first ball of Friday's group game against South Africa and was dismissed for 203.

There was potential for a sting in the tail of the innings. A swarm of insects, reportedly bees, halted the game for some minutes in the 48th over. All the players and both umpires went to ground, face down, to avoid any problems before play continued and the last two wickets were lost quickly.

The South Africans were out of semifinal contention after winning just one of its first seven games, but got on top quickly when skipper Faf du Plessis won the toss and sent the Sri Lankans in to bat.

Sri Lanka was coming off an upset win over England that changed the momentum of the tournament, exposing the hosts to the possibility of missing out on the playoffs.

Needing another win to move past Bangladesh and Pakistan and equal on eight points with fourth-place England, Sri Lanka will have to rely on another big bowling performance to defend a small total.

The Sri Lankans successfully defended a total of 232-9 in a 20-run win over England at Leeds a week ago, with veteran paceman Lasith Malinga taking four wickets.

On the up side for Malinga and his teammates, the bowlers dominated for South Africa in the first game of the tournament at Durham's county ground, with no batsman scoring more than 30.

Paceman Kagiso Rabada removed Dimuth Karunaratne with a well-directed short ball that the Sri Lanka skipper could only fend away to opposing captain du Plessis at second slip. That made Karunaratne just the second batsman dismissed on the first ball of a match in the 2019 World Cup, less than a week after New Zealand opener Martin Guptill's golden duck against West Indies.

Sri Lanka recovered through a 67-run partnership between second-wicket pair Avishka Fernando and Kusal Perera, who both scored 30, before recalled all-rounder Dwaine Pretorius dismissed them in the 10th and 12th overs.

Chris Morris picked up the key wicket of Angelo Mathews, who scored an unbeaten 85 against England, when the all-rounder dragged an attempted pull shot back onto his stumps and was out for 11.

The 30-year-old Pretorius, playing his first game since conceding 42 in seven overs and scoring just one run in South Africa's opening loss to England at the Oval, then dismissed Kusal Mendis (23) to return 3-25 from 10 overs — the most economical bowling figures so far at the tournament.

JP Duminy, another player returning to South Africa's XI, took a wicket with his first ball — Dhananjaya de Silva bowled after playing all around the ball on an attempted reverse sweep.

Rabada (2-36) and Morris (3-46) finished off the tailenders as Sri Lanka was bowled out in 49.3 overs.

784,FL-2019-000084-IND,Monsoon misery: Assam's annual tryst with floods - India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/monsoon-misery-assam-annual-tryst-with-floods-1571473-2019-07-20,"Flood affected villagers with their belongings travel on a boat in Katahguri village in river Brahmaputra. (Photo: AP)

It's tucked away in the inside pages of national newspapers, rarely makes it to prime time TV bulletins, hardly finds mention in the national discourse on development...floods in Assam are an annual affair, rarely raising more than an eyebrow.

As sure as night follows day, floods in Assam (and in most parts of the Northeast) follow the monsoon. This year has been no different.

According to data put out by Assam State Disaster Management Authority, till July 18 the death toll has touched 27 and is likely to go up. Over 4,000 villages in 28 districts out of the state's 33 have been affected.

Assam's population is just over 3 crore; of this 53.5 lakh-plus people are under threat. While close to 1,000 houses have been damaged, 88 animals have been washed away. Over 16 lakh animals, including livestock have been affected. Pictures of rhinos trying to reach higher grounds at the Kaziranga National Park surfaced on Thursday.

Over 2 lakh hectares of crop land have been affected by the flood waters. Infrastructure -- roads, bridges, culverts - and public utilities have also taken a hit.

Floods lead to loss in human lives and the economy takes a big hit. According to Central Water Commission data (1953-2016) on average 26 lakh people are affected every year in Assam; 47 lose lives, 10,961 cattle die, Rs 7 crore worth of houses destroyed and the total damage comes up to Rs 128 crore every year.

Why is Assam flood-prone?

There are both natural and man-made causes for the annual deluge.

Most of Assam falls under a meteorological zone that receives excessive rain during the monsoon season. According to the Brahmaputra Board, a central body under the Ministry of Jal Shakti tasked to monitor and control floods, the region receives rainfall ""ranging from 248 cm to 635...Rainfall of more than 40 mm in an hour is frequent and around 70 mm per hour is also not uncommon"". There have been occasions when 500 mm of rainfall has been recorded in a day.

The valley through which the Brahmaputra flows is narrow. While the river occupies 6-10 km, there are forest covers on either side. The remaining area is inhabited and farming is conducted in the low-lying areas. Overflowing rivers and flowing rapidly down the valley tend to spill over when it reaches the narrow strips.

The zone's topography also complicates matters. The steep slopes force the rivers to gush down to the plains.

Assam lies in a seismic zone -- in fact most of the Northeast does. Frequent earthquakes and resultant landslides push soil and debris into the rivers. This sedimentation raises river beds.

According to a paper published in the International Journal for Scientific Research and Development, ""Brahmaputra water contains more sediments raising river by 3 metres in some places and reducing the water carrying capacity of the river.""

Then there are man-made causes that have worsened the flood situation. Encroachment is a big issue. The population density of Brahmaputra valley was 9-29 people per sq km in 1940-41; this shot up to 200 people per sq km now, according Brahmaputra Board.

The systematic destruction of wetlands and water bodies that act as natural run-offs have aggravated the flood problem in Assam. Though embankments provide protection, most of them have not been maintained leading to breaches.

Is there a way out?

First and foremost is the need for early warning systems. There are reports that around the Assam-Bhutan border, villagers form WhatsApp groups to warn people of rising water levels.

If such people-people arrangements can work out then there is no reason why more institutionalised systems, based on technology, cannot be put in place.

(Photo: AP)

These early warning systems should be institutionalised based on scientific approach.

Wetlands and local water bodies should be revived so that the natural drainage system can act as a basin for excess water to flow. This would entail clearing human encroachments in the Brahmaputra flood plains.

Embankments should be regularly checked for breaches and systems put in place for maintenance; a first step would be to break the babu-contractor nexus that finds floods an easy way to sponge money from the system.",2019-07-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'systems', 'brahmaputra', 'flood', 'tryst', 'affected', 'rivers', 'annual', 'floods', 'misery', 'assam', 'assams', 'valley', 'monsoon', 'natural', 'river']",India,news article,English

Retired NBA star Yao Ming may ""go back to school and get very fundamental study"" at one of China's most prestigious universities this fall.

""I'm thinking about going back to school this fall,"" the towering former Houston Rockets center told US sports writer Graham Bensinger during an exclusive interview in Shanghai.

""I think education is very, very important. Remember the NBA Cares. Always tell read to achieve, read to achieve. How can you not read to achieve and then tell other kids to read to achieve?"" Yao said during the first interview since his retirement in July.（Note: NBA Cares is a program that NBA sponsors help poor kids learn to read and study.）

The Chinese basketball legend is ready to make up for his missed school days, which according to Yao ended when he was 17. He plans to go to Shanghai Jiaotong University, one of China's oldest and top public research universities based in Yao's hometown of Shanghai.

But which major Yao Ming will choose to study is unclear until this October, Yao's agent Zhang Mingji was quoted as saying by Chengdu Business Daily, a local Chinese newspaper based in Southwest China's Sichuan province.

""Yao Ming will definitely not have classes like those freshmen. He will have special teachers arranged by the university,"" Zhang said.

Yao expressed his desire to go back to college life but it would be hard for him.

""It's harder for me. It's a different life. The professional life just needs you to manage yourself, but…You cannot stop working and you have to keep thinking in college,"" Yao said during the Bensinger interview. ""(I need to) Go back to training my idea and thinking, and that is very very important.""

During the one-on-one interview, Yao Ming also mentioned he started thinking about retirement in 2009 when he had been hesitating about reconstructive surgery but his doctor warned him of life in a wheelchair or crutches by age 50 without the timely surgery.

""So I ask him, 'What if I had this surgery? What is the chance for me to back on court?' And he said, 'You can play basketball again, but nothing is guaranteed.'""

Yao revealed an annoyance to Bensinger that most people may not know – he has been deaf in his left ear since age 8 after a high fever, but the deafness doesn't have much impact on the basketball ace's life.

""I'm living well… I still can clearly hear from my right side,"" according to Yao.

Weight soars about 10kg

Yao told Bensinger he could ""focus on sharks, some other businesses and his foundation"" after ending his professional career as a basketball player two months ago.

""Now I have to spend double the time (that I've spent on basketball court) in meeting rooms, sometimes 15-16 hours in two days.""

Yao said he also put on weight because he has not been working out much since retirement. ""I'm getting fat... because my size, I've put on 20 or 30 pounds (9Kg or 13kg), but it doesn't show very much. I'm thinking about going back to work out in a very short time.""",2011-09-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['bensinger', 'fall', 'ming', 'basketball', 'yao', 'interview', 'nba', 'thinking', 'school', 'read', 'life']",China,news article,English

Right on schedule, it looks like the annual monsoon across the Southwest is getting ready to kick back into gear.

A return of monsoonal moisture is likely across the Southwest later this week, potentially bringing drought relief to a part of the country that has been hit hard by drought and wildfires in recent months.

The monsoon is in reference to the annual reversal of winds, and the southerly wind direction frequently draws up moisture-laden air from the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean. The result is needed rainfall for a typically parched part of the country.

It typically starts in mid-summer, and that looks to be the case this week.

While showers and storms aren’t expected to be particularly widespread, both Wednesday and Thursday could both feature scattered showers and storms, and they’ll be mainly concentrated in New Mexico.

Of course, this is a part of the country that especially needs the rain. After a paltry monsoon season last summer and early fall, a fruitful monsoon would be especially welcomed this year.

Pockets of extreme and severe drought are in place in some of the most monsoon-dependent areas, including northern New Mexico and southern Colorado.

While it’ll be hot in Albuquerque, New Mexico most of this week, daily shower and storm chances will creep back into the picture this weekend, and that could last into next week as well.
