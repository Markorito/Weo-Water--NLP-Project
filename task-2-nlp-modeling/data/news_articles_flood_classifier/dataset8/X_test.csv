975,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Climate Change in the Developing World: The Drowning of Jakarta - The McGill International Review,https://www.mironline.ca/climate-change-in-the-developing-world-the-drowning-of-jakarta/,"Often called the world’s fastest sinking city, Jakarta — Indonesia’s capital and most populated urban area — sinks 10cm deeper into the earth each year. A variety of human-induced processes created this problem, but one in particular is pushing it to the brink of disaster: global warming. For this article, I interviewed some Indonesian relatives for their perspectives on the drowning of Jakarta, hoping to look into how climate change is most hurting the places least equipped to deal with its consequences.

I had the chance to visit Jakarta in the summer of 2019. The ground I was standing on when I took a picture of the city’s shoreline, shown below, has now sunk thirty to forty centimetres since my visit, relative to sea level. It does not sound like a lot — that is only the length of a ruler — but minor tweaks to the order of the natural world can translate into major disorder in the human one.

A city of 11 million people, 40 per cent of Jakarta currently sits below sea level — a number that grows each year. The fastest sinking rates occur in the coastal sector, North Jakarta, where the ground drops as much as 25cm annually. Life at negative altitudes is marked by vulnerability to extreme weather and flooding. In fact, parts of North Jakarta are already flooded for good. By 2050, at present rates, that entire quarter of the city — containing the same number of residents as Montreal — will be permanently swallowed by the Java Sea. According to one Jakartan relative I spoke with, floods have come to feel like “an annual event to us,” wreaking the most havoc from January to March — the monsoon season. In 2020, a new year’s day storm produced a flood that claimed the lives of 66 people and left a further 36,000 displaced.

Another Indonesian man I spoke with recalled floods damaging furniture and electronic devices in his sister’s Jakarta home. “Now whenever a flood is threatening, they raise the items off the floor and hang them from the ceiling.”

There are two main forces pushing Jakarta underwater. Both are man-made; both could be reversible. First, the majority of Jakartans rely on the extraction of groundwater for their daily water consumption. This is because the city’s water pipe infrastructure is outdated and can only sustain 40 per cent of residents’ demand. Hence, rather than looking to unreliable public agencies to supply tap water, most people resort to private ground pumps or wells, which extract water from deposits found dozens of metres below ground. Groundwater extraction is a common form of water subsistence — one-third of Canadians get water to their taps through this method. But when millions depend on groundwater extraction each and every day — a process which often goes unregulated in Indonesia — the earth under the city starts to deflate, and in turn Jakarta starts to sink.

According to hydrologists, Indonesian officials must commit to a full revamp of the city’s water supply infrastructure, constructing a new system that funnels rain and river water into man-made reservoirs connected to the city’s water pipes. In the late 1960s, groundwater extraction in Tokyo created a similar sinking crisis. Fortunately, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government implemented a combination of regulatory laws and infrastructure reform, stopping the sinking by the turn of the century.

Yet, a more daunting problem looms over Jakarta and the rest of the world. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels continue to intensify the planet’s greenhouse effect. The result — global warming — induces thermal expansion of the water that makes up Earth’s oceans and the melting of the ice that makes up Earth’s poles. For this reason, sea levels have been rising for over a century across the world. But especially in developing areas like Jakarta, marked by outdated infrastructure and less capital to invest in costly alternatives, rising sea levels blend with pre-existing problems like excessive groundwater extraction, and the result is that the intensity of the climate crisis is felt at a two-fold rate.

Local groundwater extraction is behind Jakarta’s sinking and must be slowed, but global warming is where the long-term humanitarian crises are contained. Indonesian President Joko Widodo invested in the construction of a giant seawall and 17 artificial islands in the Jakarta Bay to protect the city from storms and flooding as it continues to sink. Yet, rising sea levels mean that the Java Sea is slowly climbing on these blockades, rendering them increasingly ineffective at preventing disaster. Asking not to be referenced by name, the same man who told me about his sister’s flooding problems said, “Yes, right now a sea wall stops the seawater from inundating the city, [but] seawater could breach the wall at any time.” He believes that underfunding often results in half-baked infrastructural solutions to many of Indonesia’s safety concerns; a critique authorities do not always react well to when you remind them.

President Widodo’s 2019 decision to move the nation’s capital from Jakarta to the neighbouring island of Borneo foreshadows the long-term displacement, health, and economic predicaments that fester where underdevelopment meets climate change.

In 2007, a particularly strong storm left half of Jakarta flooded; 80 people lost their lives, 600,000 lost their homes, and taxpayers lost over $500 million USD to the recovery, taking away from development projects. Despite this devastation, the people I spoke with had no special memory of this incident; “many floods occur every year in Jakarta, it is numbing.”

In 30 years, when North Jakarta is submerged, what will have happened to the millions who live and work there today? “They will have to move to higher ground,” said one relative, plainly. An increased intensity of meteorological events puts mass displacement in the forecast. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America will generate 143 million climate migrants. While some will seek refuge internationally, most displacement will happen internally because, as UN researcher Arno Tanner highlights, “people whose livelihoods are most sensitive to environmental changes also tend to be those who do not have the means to move very far.” Ultimately then, the heaviest burden will be borne by the same countries experiencing the worst of the climate crisis in the first place.

The melting of polar ice is causing Jakarta to drown, but other developing nations are experiencing the polar opposite effect: drought. In Botswana, for instance, global warming has reduced total rainfall, leading to a drop in agricultural production and increasing food insecurity. In recent years, delegates at the UN General Assembly have warned that climate change is inhibiting countries from attaining their Sustainable Development Goals. The permanent flooding of North Jakarta would compromise $220 billion in assets, and would hinder productivity and economic growth, according to Indonesia’s Ministry of Economic Affairs. Ultimately, the burning of fossil fuels is one of the global economy’s greatest market failures.

Today, a rather topical concern is also raised by climbing ocean levels: the spread of disease. The World Health Organization warns that when rapid flooding uproots sewage systems and carries their contents through the streets, there is a heightened risk of infectious disease spread. “Six common diseases to watch out for during floods,” read the front page of the Jakarta Post at the beginning of 2020.

As predicted, climate change is beginning to disproportionately impact the corners of the globe least equipped to face and finance its consequences. The drowning of Jakarta is ‘exhibit A’ to this process. And yet, the countries that bear the most responsibility for the creation of this crisis, in per capita terms, will likely bear the least of the burden. The carbon footprint of the average Canadian is about seven times greater than the average Jakartan’s, and yet some models predict that Canada could be one of few nations to actually benefit from global warming (as cultivable land and natural resource deposits thaw). Nonetheless, in a globalized world, mass displacement, economic stagnation, and the spread of disease — as we have seen first-hand — are threats which all nations have a shared interest in preventing. The worst of the climate crisis can be avoided if countries legitimately commit to their ‘long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies’ mandated by the 2016 Paris Agreement.

Altogether 42.87 lakh people in 4,157 Assam villages are reeling under the impact of the floods that have submerged 1,53,211 hectares of farm land in 30 districts, according to the daily report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).

Of the 24 deaths reported till 6 pm on Monday in Bihar, Sitamarhi accounted for 10, while nine deaths were reported from Araria, four from Kishanganj and one from Sheohar, a Disaster Management Department report said. Four deaths were reported till Sunday evening from Araria (2), Sheohar (1) and Kishanganj (1).

Five more children drowned in two separate incidents in Bihar's East Champaran district, but a senior official of the state disaster management department said they were not counted among the flood casualties.

The Disaster Management report said that 25,66,100 people have been affected by flood waters in 77 blocks of 12 districts in Bihar -- Sheohar, Sitamarhi, East Champaran, Madhubani, Araria, Kishanganj, Supaul, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Saharsa, Katihar and Purnea. Saharsa, Katihar and Purnea districts are the latest addition to the list of the districts marooned.

Here are the top 10 developments:

1. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal briefed the Prime Minister over phone about the current situation and the relief, rescue and rehabilitation work undertaken by the state government. PM Modi assured Sonowal of all assistance from the Centre in dealing with the situation.

2. The Assam State Disaster Management Authority report said embankments, roads, bridges, culverts and many other infrastructure have been damaged at various places. Massive erosion has been witnessed in Udalguri, Barpeta and Sonitpur districts.

3. Brahmaputra has been rising menacingly above the danger level across the state, swelling up in Guwahati and overflowing its bank in the Uzan Bazar area, officials said.

4. Flood waters in Assam have submerged major portions of Kaziranga, Pobitora and Manas rhino habitats, forcing the animals to take shelter in the artificial highlands for safety. A release by the Assam Ministry of Forest and Environment said about 90 per cent of Kaziranaga National Park is presently inundated. Around 70 per cent of the 46 sq km area at Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Morigaon district has also been inundated, forcing one-horned rhinos to venture into the nearby highlands. The sanctuary near Guwahati has the highest density of Indian one-horned rhinos in the world at over 100.

5. At present, 15 teams of the NDRF with 38 deep divers, 48 IRB boats and other life-saving aids are deployed in Assam. An NDRF release said the force rescued more than 2,500 people from flood-affected areas in Baksa, Morigaon, Golaghat, Barpeta and Kamrup districts since July 11.

6. Bokakhat, through which National Highway-37 passes, has been cut off from the entire upper Assam due to floodwaters. The Golaghat district administration has banned movement of vehicles at Numaligarh and diverted traffic towards Guwahati via Diphu and Manja in neighbouring Karbi Anglong district.

7. In Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar undertook an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas. Directing officials to expedite relief and rescue operations, Kumar asked them to restore the road connectivity which was snapped due to flood waters. The CM asked officials to open relief camps and community kitchens as per requirement and ensure availability of good quality food, safe drinking water and cleanliness at camps, besides fodder for cattle.

8. According to a Water Resources Department bulletin, five rivers -- Baghmati, Kamla Balan, Lalbakeya, Adhwara and Mahananda -- are flowing above their respective danger levels at various places in the state. The Baghmati river is flowing above danger mark at five places including Dheng, Sonakhan, Dubbadhar in Sitamarhi while at one place at Benibad in Muzaffarpur district.

Chin Kwai-lam sits in a factory-converted room. He lives with four other households. The families may be evicted in October as ordered by their landlord. Yik Yeung-Man / For China Daily After a long day of work, Chin Kwai-lam (left) and Liang Fawei share a cigarette break in Liang's 250-square-foot unit. Yik Yeung-Man / For China Daily Li Hung-ha lives in a 150-square-foot factory-converted room in Tai Kok Tsui which she says her 11-month-old baby cannot stand the poor hygiene and heat during extremely humid summer months. Yik Yeung-Man / For China Daily

With rents and land prices shooting up, and the government cracking down on illegal, subdivided accommodations, many families still live in fear of becoming cast out onto the street with nowhere to turn. Ming Yeung reports.

It's cramped and musty in what Chin Kwai-lam and his family call ""home"". The dwelling on Bedford Road in Tai Kok Tsui used to be a garment factory. Now it's dilapidated and derelict.

The tiny abode is only 200 square feet. It's cluttered. Clothes and cooking utensils are scattered among Chin's other meager possessions. He barely has room to move.

It's all he can afford. There's nowhere else to go.

Hong Kong's property prices soared to a 13-year high in February. In lock step, landlords moved frantically to jack up rents. The increases were dramatic - with landlords raising rents 20-30 percent year on year.

There's no rent control and tenants in cramped, partitioned apartments in which several people reside, pay more per square foot of living space than people in luxury flats.

Chin says the family pays HK$2,500 a month and a few hundred Hong Kong dollars over and above that for water and electricity, accounting for one third of his wife's monthly salary. Chin does casual jobs and he cannot rely on his income from one month to the next.

Chin's his family lives there, more or less protected because they are in a legal gray area. Fire hazards are much greater in old factory buildings than in residential units. Moving into a residential building presents no option for Chin. He says the rent in a residential building would be double, or HK$5,000 a month, at least.

The family has been in the place for more than three years - awaiting allocation to public housing. The situation is not secure. The landlord demolished all subdivided flats on the upper two floors of the building. Only five families remain in the building.

The landlord issued a legal notice to Chin and his neighbors in May requesting that they move out by the end of June. They're still there. But rumors are floating around that everyone will be evicted in October. Chin now lives in terror that he and his family could end up on the street.

At dead end, Society for Community Organization (SoCo), a poverty advocacy group, suggested that the tenants not move from their illegal abodes unless they are relocated to public housing, transit centers or interim housing.

Transit centers and interim housing are temporary accommodations provided by the Housing Authority (HA) for those who become homeless as a result of natural disasters or clearance operations.

SoCo estimates subdivided flats in industrial buildings house more than 10,000 low-wage earners, the majority of whom are waiting for public housing.

The HA says it has plans to build 75,000 public housing units during the next five years, averaging about 15,000 new flats per annum.

But the supply is vastly inadequate, observes Sze Lai-shan, community organizer from SoCo, adding that grassroots families like Chin's are in a long queue waiting for public housing. By the end of March, about 152,400 applicants were on the waiting list. The average waiting time is three years.

At a meeting with a group of subdivided flat residents on Aug 23, lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung made a promise to Chin that he will discuss the matter with the HA and try to re-house the affected families to interim housing as soon as possible.

""Compulsory demolition (of illegal subdivided flats) perhaps is necessary for the sake of your safety, but it can only be done after your relocation is taken care of. How nerve-racking it is to live constantly under threat,"" Leung told the people at the meeting.

When local light industry migrated to the mainland in the early 1990s, an abundance of industrial buildings and warehouses were left vacant in older factory areas such as Tai Kok Tsui, San Po Kong and Kwun Tong.

Seeing the housing needs of the working poor, owners of vacant industrial buildings were more than happy to convert the abandoned spaces into rooms to make extra money, disregarding that they were violating the law.

The trend toward living in flats in converted factories began just a few years ago. The flats offer cheaper rent for relatively bigger floor space. The ""easy-come-and-go"" atmosphere attracted poverty-stricken people who can barely afford deposits required by residential building owners.

Li Hung-ha also lives in a room in a converted factory building. The single mother lives with her 11-month-old son in a factory on Larch Street. The floor has subdivided into 39 rooms, no more than 150-square-foot each. About 40 people share the space which has two washrooms and three shower rooms in one corner.

Li moved to the factory building in 2009 when her pregnancy forced her to stop working. Losing her job meant she could no longer afford the subdivided room in a private residence in Mong Kok.

Since the whole floor is partitioned entirely by wooden planks, cooking on gas stoves is strictly prohibited in Li's building, owing to the fire hazards.

""I fear nothing but a fire. If there's a fire, there's no way out,"" Li complains.

Apart from unauthorized door openings that do not meet fire safety requirements, common problems in such units are the addition of partitions that block fire escape routes and the overloading of buildings because of excessive partitions and raised floor platforms.

Li tells China Daily that people from the Buildings Department (BD) occasionally knock on the doors, wanting to come in to carry out inspections. The tenants just ignore them, she says.

The BD intended to break into the flats on Aug 22, but temporarily suspended the plan after negotiations with SoCo. The organization is lobbying legislators to relocate the affected tenants.

""Breaking into the building will not ultimately solve the problems. If the tenants are evicted, they will reside in another industrial building,"" Sze Lai-shan notes.

The BD did not respond to China Daily's inquiry about how the department handles situations when landlords refuse to comply with demolition orders as well as relocating displaced tenants, commenting that the department ""has been occupied by other commitments recently"".

Under the Buildings Ordinance, officers can break in to a premises for an inspection, in the presence of police, to find out if there are unauthorized additions or alterations that affect fire or structural safety of a building.

Li says she wants to find a safe and decent room because her baby suffers given the poor hygiene and the heat during the extremely humid summer months.

""The one more month CSSA (Comprehensive Social Security Assistance) payment released in July was mostly spent on my baby's medical treatment,"" she laments while looking at the toddler who has been unwell in the last few months.

Li and her baby rely on HK$6,000 social welfare a month. More than one third of it, HK$2,400, goes to rental. The remaining amount is barely enough to feed them, let alone provide sufficient funds to move.

Lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung is urging the Social Welfare Department (SWD) to help needy people pay deposits and other expenses if they are to be moved back to private residences.

A spokesman for the SWD replies that the department works with Integrated Family Service Centres to link up with people in need, especially elderly and disabled people, to whom they offer assistance.

The department will also take into consideration the circumstances of individual needs, the spokesman adds, to grant special emoluments to able-bodied people.

But according to Li, the SWD agrees to pay only HK$4,000 to subsidize her and she needs at least HK$8,000 in total for all expenses.

Chin Kwai-lam's neighbor Liang Fawei says he prefers to live in interim housing rather than a private residence not because of the skyrocketing rental rates but because of the limited space.

Liang's family will be allocated a room in public housing in 2012 at the earliest.

As advised by Liang's welfare officer, the family of five could consider applying for CSSA so that the household would get rent allowance as well.

According to SWD's mechanism, rent allowance granted to social welfare households ranges from HK$1,265 for a person to HK$3,545 for four people.

""It's not about the pecuniary assistance. Even if I can afford HK$6,000 for rental a month, there's no way I can find a room as good as this one,"" he stresses.

Now living in a 300-square-foot room, the family once rented a flat half that size on Canton Road for HK$4,100 a month.

Liang recalls the rooftop unit was boiling hot, forcing them to move back to the factory building.

""I have no other requests. I just wish that we will be granted a place in interim housing before October, before we are evicted and end up living on the street,"" Liang says, faintly.

Many industrial buildings have been left vacant in old factory districts like Tai Kok Tsui since the 1990s. Landlords thus partitioned the empty spaces into sub-divided flats which are now housing some 10,000 low-wage earners. Yik Yeung-man / For China Daily

34,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Warming threatens to cut crop yields | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/warming-threatens-cut-crop-yields/,"Projecting the impact of climate change on global food production is no easy task. A warming climate might result in better crop yields in one region, but cause drought and crop failure in another.

A new US study, published in the journal Environmental Letters, assesses the odds of a major slowdown in global food production over the next 20 years.

Overall, the study’s authors say, the likelihood of a sharp drop in yields of crops vital to food supply, such as wheat and maize, is “not very high” − but global warming does markedly increase the chance of such events happening. The risk to global food supplies is about 20 times greater when man-made climate change is taken into account.

“Climate change has substantially increased the prospect that crop production will fail to keep up with rising demand in the next 20 years,” says Claudia Tebaldi, a research scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a co-author of the study.

“ The truth is that, over a period of 10 or 20 years, it depends largely on how fast the Earth warms, and we can’t predict the pace of warming very precisely. So the best we can do is try to determine the odds David Lobell, associate director of the Center on Food Security and the Environmentat California’s Stanford University

Climate trends

Tebaldi, together with David Lobell, an associate director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment at California’s Stanford University, used computer models of global climate trends, together with data on weather patterns and crops, to calculate the odds of a major downturn in food supplies.

“I’m often asked whether climate change will threaten food supply, as if it’s a simple yes or no answer,” Lobell says.

“The truth is that, over a period of 10 or 20 years, it depends largely on how fast the Earth warms, and we can’t predict the pace of warming very precisely. So the best we can do is try to determine the odds.”

Yields of crops such as maize and wheat have typically increased by between one and two per cent a year over recent decades. This trend, says the study, needs to be maintained to cope with population growth, greater per capita food consumption, and the increased use of crops for biofuels.

The authors of the study – which was funded by the US government’s National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy − found that under what they term natural climate shifts, the odds on that trend slowing up to 2030 were only 1 in 200.

Global food supplies

However, when human-induced global warming is taken into account, the odds shorten to one in 10 for a slowing in yields of maize and one in 20 for wheat production. Such cutbacks, says the study, would have a major impact on global food supplies at a time when demand is growing sharply.

Tebaldi and Lobell say an increase of 1˚C in temperature is capable of slowing maize yields by 7% and wheat yields by 6 per cent, although there are regional variations to these figures.

The study says a slowdown in yields of maize and wheat could, in theory, be offset by shifting planting to cooler regions, but there is little sign that such shifts are happening – at least not quickly enough to take account of warmer temperatures.

“We can’t predict whether a major slowdown in crop growth will actually happen, and the odds are still fairly low,” says Tebaldi.

“But climate change has increased the odds to the point that organisations concerned with food security or global stability need to be aware of this risk.”",2014-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['threatens', 'climate', 'cut', 'study', 'warming', 'yields', 'odds', 'global', '20', 'maize', 'crop', 'wheat', 'food']",China,news article,English
1133,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Floods devastate Dokolo district - Uganda - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/floods-devastate-dokolo-district,"By Hudson Apunyo

Gardens, roads, and homes in five sub-counties of Dokolo district have been submerged by the rising water levels of Lake Kwania, making over a thousand families homeless.

The people affected have moved to higher grounds as the devastating floods continue to wreak havoc in the district.

Olga Hope Eriong, a resident of Acungapenyi, Kachung parish in Agwata sub-county says the community whose homes have been submerged by floods is experiencing problems of lack of food and shelter.

She says there is a scarcity of building materials, so they are facing difficulties in constructing new houses.

Middy Amek, a mother of four, whose home was affected says the water level started rising last year and since then, it has covered more than 700 metres inland towards her home.

""I have to leave this place but it's not easy, due to lack of building materials,"" she said.

Karina Akite, a resident of the place says she last witnessed such flooding in 1962 but that time, there was much rain.

The ceremonial ground near her home is all flooded. Dokolo RDC Lawrence Egole said they recently used the ground during a funeral.

Kuranimo Dai, another resident said their homes are greatly affected.

Dai said at night, it's very cold, there're many mosquitoes and snakes. He also said the flood water smells bad.

Nelson Okello, a youthful retail trader in the village said he is being forced out of his home by the flood.

Ronny Opio Okodi, a resident in the area said over 490 houses have been affected by the water in the village. He is appealing for emergency assistance to enable them to relocate to high land.

Ongom Apita, 66, says floods have destroyed his citrus farm.

""Even my fish pond and bananas that NAADS gave me were destroyed,"" he said.

Agwata sub-county LC3 Chairperson Geofrey Ojungu says most of the people in nine villages, are affected by the water from the lake Kwania.

""We are planning to relocate them to schools and sub-county headquarter's land,"" he said.

The district chairperson Fredrick Odongo says the floods have affected the sub-counties of Agwata, Adok, Kwera, Adeknino, Okwongdul, and Kangai.

""Last week we went to the sub-counties of Kwera, Adeknino, and Okwongodul and found a number of homes destroyed, gardens flooded, and roads destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said the road network in the district has been greatly affected and they have to be reconstructed when the flood subsides.

He said in Agwata, where they visited on Monday, they found a similar situation.

""A number of farms and homes have been destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said they wrote to the office of the Prime Minister who sent a consignment of relief items including 15, 000kg of maize flour, 5000kg of beans, and 50 bundles of tarpaulin.

Odongo added that they have not received 300 pieces of blankets as indicated in a letter dated May 28, 2020, signed by Rose Nakabugo on behalf of the Permanent Secretary.

The Chief Administrative Officer of Dokoo district Isa Mbooge says although the consignment was not enough, he shared with his colleagues of Amolatar and Kwania.

""We have to appreciate what they have given us because everybody is looking at the same source,"" Mbooge said.

865,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"The imperialist past that started dam politics between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia - The Conversation CA",https://theconversation.com/the-imperialist-past-that-started-dam-politics-between-egypt-sudan-and-ethiopia-156760,"Ever since construction began a decade ago, there’s been serious contention between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a huge project straddling the Blue Nile in Ethiopia.

For Ethiopia, the project is meant to offer a solution to its severe power problem, providing electricity access for an estimated 65 million Ethiopians. Ethiopia also says its neighbours will benefit from cheap energy exports.

Egypt relies on the Blue Nile for freshwater, and maintains that the dam represents an existential threat.

For its part, Sudan has had to balance its own concerns about water supply with the dam’s promise of cheap power and flood control. Recently it appears that Sudan has firmed up on its opposition to the Dam.

For my doctoral thesis, I am studying the geopolitical realities on the governance of the Nile’s resources. This isn’t the first time that relations in the region have been strained by dam politics – its history is a long one and the tensions felt today are rooted in the imperial past.

The beginning

It started with the occupation of Egypt by Britain in 1882. Egypt became independent in 1922, though British influence remained strong for another three decades until the last British troops left in 1956.

Great Britain ’s textile industries depended on Egyptian cotton, which relied on irrigation using the River Nile’s water. To conserve water during the rainy seasons for dry seasons, British hydrologists developed a plan called the Century Storage Scheme.

The plan envisaged the regulation of the Nile waters along different seasons and years (drought and flood) by building several dams and reservoirs in Ethiopia and other upstream countries. The plan ruled out storing the Nile waters in downstream countries, mainly because of immense water losses that could happen due to evaporation.

But the plan had one major flaw. It didn’t consider the interests of nine upstream countries including Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Its aim was to safeguard Great Britain’s interests.

Aswan High Dam

The biggest project on the Nile was initiated by Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt’s prime minister between 1954-56 and then president until 1970. Nasser wanted to build a dam which would end Egypt’s dependency on upstream countries by storing the Nile waters in Egypt. It would also end flooding and bring more electricity to Egyptians.

Nasser decided to build the dam at Aswan, creating a big reservoir in the northern border between Sudan and Egypt. The reservoir, called Lake Nasser, stretches about 125 miles from Egypt into Sudan where it is called Lake Nubia.

The Aswan High Dam was initially described by British hydrologists as “not worthy of serious consideration” and “full of mad ideas for the Nile.” This was because it was the antithesis of the Century Storage Scheme and the basin-wide approach that dominated water management on the Nile under the British.

Read more: Plans for a dam across the Nile triggered a war in 1956: will it happen again?

Sudan gained its independence in 1956. The new government opposed the colonial treaties, which Great Britain signed with Egypt on behalf Sudan and favoured Egypt.

It also opposed the construction of the Aswan High Dam because of the high social, economic and environmental costs. These, according to an American historian of East Africa and Nile expert Professor Robert Collin, included the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Sudanese Nubians, the destruction of historical cities, the threat of increased in soil salinity and water-logging, and increase seismic activity from the weight of the reservoir on fault lines.

Sudan instead favoured the Century Storage Scheme which involved a series of smaller dams in Uganda and Ethiopia, together with the Jonglei Canal. The canal was meant to divert the flow of the White Nile, bypassing the vast swamps of the Sudd, in South Sudan, where water is lost to evaporation. The construction of the Jonglei Canal started in 1978 but was suspended in 1983.

As part of the Century Storage Scheme, in 1956 Sudan went ahead with plans to construct the Roseires Dam on the Blue Nile and expand the country’s Gezira irrigation scheme.

To implement their respective projects, both Egypt and Sudan tried to get funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, later to become the World Bank. However, since the Roseires Dam would alter the flow of the Nile, and the Aswan High Dam would have significant socio-economic impacts on Sudan, the bank required the two countries reach an agreement to get the funds.

This proved impossible. The Sudanese parliament refused to consent to the construction of the Aswan High Dam while Egypt was committed to start the construction work.

A dramatic turn of events in 1958 changed the course of history. General Ibrahim Abboud deposed the Sudanese government and Abboud signed the 1959 Nile Waters Treaty with Egypt and consented to the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

Egypt completed the construction of Aswan High Dam in 1971. The dam continued to operate in favour of Egypt, providing water for irrigation and generating a huge amount of electricity.

The Grand Renaissance Dam

Aswan High Dam and the 1959 Nile Waters Treaty, which totally disregarded the interest of upstream countries, also frustrated Ethiopia. The dam, which evaporates 10-15 BCM of waters annually, would also foreclose Ethiopia’s future use of the Nile.

In 1959 Ethiopia commissioned a survey on the Blue Nile for irrigation and hydropower. The survey, carried out by the US Bureau of Reclamation, issued its final report in 1964 which proposed various projects including a “border dam,” which later became the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.

Ethiopia was not immediately able to implement the project due to a lack of finance. Egypt also used extensive diplomatic connections and the colonial-era 1929 and 1959 agreements to prevent the construction of any major infrastructure projects on the tributaries of the Nile.

Finally, after decades of political stability and economic growth, Ethiopia managed to raise a significant portion of money for the dam’s construction from people locally and from its diaspora. The construction of the dam eventually began in 2011.

Basin-wide cooperation

The dam now joins a number of existing dams, including the Aswan High Dam and the Roseires Dam. This makes a basin-wide cooperation and management imperative.

Given the ever increasing importance of coordinated management and operation downstream and upstream dams due to climate change, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt should manage all dams through the Nile Basin Commission – an organisation envisaged in the Cooperative Framework Agreement.

58,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Thirsty Lima Uses Robust Planning to Address Its Future Water Needs - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/10/05/thirsty-lima-uses-robust-planning-to-address-its-future-water-needs,"When residents tell tourists that it never rains in Lima, they are a mere .3 inches from the truth. One third of an inch of rain (about 6 mm), or a drop in the bucket, is the annual rainfall. Drought and El Niño conditions have long been a backdrop to everyday life in this city of nearly 10 million where the Andes meets desert and the land spills into the Pacific Ocean.

More than 1.5 million residents are underserved: They live without running water and with chronic shortages, often waiting for delivery trucks. Villa El Salvador, for example, began as a shantytown on the outskirts of Lima in 1970, and has been growing in colorful tenements up the eroded foothills ever since. But water there is still a luxury.

“Climate change is hitting hard and the future of water for Lima is in doubt,” said Carter Brandon, lead economist with the World Bank. “We don’t actually know what the climate impact is going to be. Or the city’s future growth either.”

Andean topology is so extreme that climate models can’t predict what will happen to rainfall. Lima’s future water security is of great concern to government officials, regulators, the water utility company SEDAPAL, and the people who live and work in this arid port city.

The World Bank has been investigating the need for robust decision making in Lima, and recently completed a comprehensive study of SEDAPAL’s $2.7 billion master plan for water resources to 2040. The Bank draws upon state-of-the art methods for Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMU).

“We have to make decisions even when we don’t know the future,” said Laura Bonzanigo, World Bank economist specializing in DMU. “Through the DMU methodology, we can look at the range of possibilities and come up with minimum requirements to meet every possibility—robust decisions with no regrets.”

In spite of SEDAPAL’s Master Plan, key questions remained. Could the proposed investments ensure reliability in the face of deep uncertainties? Are they all required? What if there are delays? What is the best sequence so that investments ensure both “no regrets” and maximum future adaptability?

The study helped SEDAPAL revise its Master Plan of 14 large-scale investments by identifying projects that it can embark upon now, while preparing future actions adaptively as conditions evolve. When the World Bank team analyzed the 14 projects, they found that investments representing 75 percent of the proposed cost of the Master Plan ($2.0 billion) met water reliability targets just as much as the full $2.7 billion plan. More capital investment did not improve reliability. The study saved the city over $600 million.

Historically, utility companies are used to construction--pumping stations, dams, water treatment plans and tunnels through mountains. “But it turns out some of the most valuable things they can do are ‘soft.’ They can encourage water conservation and recycling. They can make ecological investments in the upper watersheds, working with farmers and ranchers. And they can do better water-quality monitoring with mining companies to protect water quality,” Brandon added.

For the first time, the utility is reaching out to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to protect watersheds and groundwater aquifers. It is also beginning to work with consumers to use less water per household, and exploring with the municipality ways to use recycled water for parks. The analysis has earned the confidence of regulatory and budget agencies. SEDAPAL has also requested further World Bank support, mostly in these areas that supplement more traditional “bricks and mortar” investments.

Engaging Peruvian NGOs is significant because they work closely with communities in upper watershed management (“green” infrastructure) and environmental monitoring. And the universities are important due to SEDAPAL’s interest in training others so the method can be widely applied in other cities under water stress across Peru and other Andean countries.

Decision-Making under Deep Uncertainty is an increasingly important tool for virtually any sector involving long-term planning and investments. Drawing from the Lima study, final workshop participants Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil have already approached the World Bank country offices to request support in the water sector. But other types of investment planning equally suited to this type of analysis are transportation, energy, flood management, and urban development.

A recently published report titled ""Robust Decision-Making in the Water Sector: a Strategy for Implementing Lima’s Long-Term Water Resources Master Plan"" includes more information on the Lima water study. The Bank has also released a new methodological book that helps program managers demonstrate the robustness of their projects, “Confronting Climate Uncertainty in Water Resource Planning and Project Design: The Decision Tree Framework.”",2015-10-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['work', 'water', 'planning', 'address', 'bank', 'world', 'investments', 'uses', 'master', 'thirsty', 'plan', 'study', 'robust', 'lima', 'future', 'needs']",Somalia,news article,English

168,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Take the Most Hazardous Science Quiz Ever - Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/take-the-most-hazardous-science-quiz-ever/,"Earthquakes are notorious perils in California, but do you know how much damage they can do in the eastern U.S.? Our country turns out to vulnerable to many risky natural events: quakes and hurricanes, but also huge sinkholes and dust storms as well as rising seas, flooding rivers and wildfires. They cost lives and money. Identifying hazards like these and telling people how much risk the events pose at any given time is a focus of the U.S. Geological Survey, which partnered with Scientific American to create this 10-item quiz about our potential for different disasters. See how much you really know about our country’s dangers.

1. How many Americans live and work in areas exposed to potentially damaging earthquakes?

About 10 percent of the population About 25 percent About 50 percent Almost all

Damage from the January 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif. Credit: USGS

ANSWER: C—Nearly 50 percent of the U.S. population live and work in areas of the 48 contiguous states, as well as earthquake-prone areas of Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. territories, that are exposed to potentially damaging ground shaking from earthquakes. Looking only at the most severe ground-shaking levels, the 10 states with the most people at risk are, in descending order: California, Washington, Utah, Tennessee, Oregon, South Carolina, Nevada, Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois. Although this level of shaking is estimated to occur relatively infrequently, it could cause significant damage and causalities.

A Scientific American report explains the causes of tremors and what makes them stop, whether they can be predicted and whether our buildings can be made more quake-proof. In the middle of the country scientists are increasingly sure that wastewater injection tied to fracking for oil and gas is causing more tremors.

2. On average, how much are landslides estimated to cost the nation each year?

$38 million $3.5 billion $1 billion

A rockslide has closed State Road 140 near Ferguson, Calif., since 2006. Credit: USGS

Answer: B—In the U.S. landslides cost the nation an estimated $3.5 billion per year. This is an estimate because there is no uniform method to track landslide losses or a central government agency that does so. Local losses can be very high. For example, the winter season rains associated with the 1997–98 El Niño caused landslide damage estimated at $210.2 million in the San Francisco Bay Area. Right now the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are working on a Debris-Flow Warning System to help provide forecasts and alerts.

Other countries also worry about slides: In Nepal researchers are putting sensors on mountains to forecast rockfall hazards. Learn more about the dangers in the U.S. at http://landslides.usgs.gov/

3. How many potentially active volcanoes are there in the U.S.?

5 23 169

An explosion at Kilauea volcano in Hawaii on July 16, 2008. Credit: USGS

Answer: C—The U.S. is home to 169 active volcanoes, many of which could erupt at any time. The Volcano Hazards Program, run by the geological survey, monitors activity around these volcanoes—earthquakes, ground movement, volcanic gas, rock chemistry, water chemistry, remote satellite analysis—on a continuous or near–real-time basis. Monitoring lets the agency issues warnings and alerts, including imminent or ongoing eruptions, ash fall forecasts and notifications when eruptions have ended.

Scientists are also examining dormant volcanoes such as the behemoth below Yellowstone National Park. Worldwide, Indonesia is most at risk from eruptions, according to researchers. Learn more about volcano prediction at http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/

4. How much of the U.S. is vulnerable to sinkholes, which are rock areas that dissolve easily?

100 percent 55 percent 5 percent 20 percent

Sinkholes damaged homes in western Florida in 2010. Credit: USGS

Answer: D—About 20 percent of the nation sits atop of terrain known as karst. In these areas the underlying rock can be dissolved by groundwater, and then the ground is vulnerable to collapse. Sinkholes are common in these places and can be as sudden as they are devastating. The most damage from sinkholes tends to occur in Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Many sinkholes also form after human activity. Collapses can occur above old mines, from leaky faucets, when sewers give way or due to groundwater pumping and construction.

5. How many people in U.S. have floods killed each year, on average, over the past 30 years?

8 82 332

In June 2011 downtown Minot, N.D., was inundated by the Souris River. Credit: USGS

Answer: B—Floods have killed an average of 82 people each year during the last 30 years, and caused $8 billion in damages annually. Floodwatch, a Web site operated by the USGS, offers a map with hourly updates of flood conditions at over 3,000 locations throughout the U.S.

There are also giant flows of vapor, dubbed “atmospheric rivers,” that unleash floods periodically, and climate change could increase their frequency. To understand more about traditional floods, look at http://water.usgs.gov/floods/

6. In what year did wildfires burn the most acreage in the U.S.?

1984 1991 2015

A wildfire burning in Alaska in April 2016. Credit: USGS

Answer: C—The 10 million acres that burned in the U.S. in 2015 were the most on record, primarily due to drought conditions. The national average has been 6.7 million acres for the past 10 years, and 3.6 million acres burned in 2014. Wildfire risks to firefighters, homes and property, along with threats to communities, landscapes and species are increasing, as are response and recovery costs. Alaska was of particular concern last year; over five million acres were blackened by intense wildfires.

Worldwide, forests from the Arctic to Indonesia are flaring up more often as climate changes. In the U.S. the geological survey plays a major role in mapping areas of wildfire hazards, and you can find out about it at http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2006/3015/

7. What months typically make up hurricane season along the Atlantic Coast?

June–November March–August May–October

Hurricane Irene destroyed a long stretch of road in Rodanthe, N.C., in late August 2011. Credit: USGS

Answer: A—From June through November major tropical cyclones generate the most concern. On average during this period, 12 tropical storms, six of which become hurricanes (categorized as having winds exceeding 74 miles per hour), form over the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea or Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Weather Service. In addition to high winds, heavy rainfall and storm surges cause tremendous damage.

Researchers have explored hurricane origins to find out what makes the storms so big. Learn more about storm seasons at http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/hurricane-season-is-here/

8. Are sea level rise rates increasing faster along the U.S. west or east coast?

West East It's the same for both

The marshes of the Plum Island Estuary in Massachusetts are disappearing beneath the Atlantic. Credit: USGS

Answer: B—Along portions of the Atlantic coast, rates of sea level rise are increasing three to four times faster than globally. Since about 1990 sea level rise in the 600-mile stretch of coastal zone from Cape Hatteras, N.C., to north of Boston has increased from two to 3.7 millimeters per year. Globally, annual sea level rose less, going up from 0.6 to 1.0 millimeter.

Earlier this year scientists reported that sea levels were going up faster now that at any time during the past 2,000 years. Learn about the rising tides at https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp-ID=3256.html

9. True or false? The same size earthquake will cause damage over a larger area in the western U.S. than the east.

True False

A magnitude 5.8 quake hit this house in Virginia on August 23, 2011. Credit: USGS

Answer: B—Earthquake shaking in the eastern U.S. can travel much farther and cause damage over larger areas. The difference is due in part to the geologic structure and rock properties that allow seismic waves to travel farther without weakening. Whereas earthquakes occur more frequently in the west, people in the east should still be prepared. A geologist explained in Scientific American why eastern quakes travel so well, and the geological survey also has information at https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp-ID=3447.html

10. In the near future, which part of the U.S. is likely to see large increases in dust storms?

Southwest Midwest Southeast

Dust storm near Winslow, Ariz., in April 2011. Credit: USGS

Answer: A—Dust storm frequency has increased and is projected to continue in the Southwest, affecting human and ecosystem health. Several lines of evidence link these storms to more intensive land-use practices and a decadelong drought. Climate model projections of sustained drier conditions in the Southwest will likely reduce the amount of perennial vegetation covering the land, and a growing human population can disturb naturally protected soil surfaces. Both of these factors make it more likely that soils will be eroded in high winds and increase the amount of particulate matter in the air we breathe.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Her one-story house collapsed and savings of a lifetime vanished in a flash in the rain fury that has wrecked havoc in Kerala in the past few days.Baby, in her early 50s, lost everything in a landslip and is currently lodged at a relief camp at Kalpetta in the high range Wayanad district.Kerala floods live updates: Situation still grim, Centre announces additional Rs 100 crore""Everything turned upside down in a few seconds...Now, we have no house, no furniture, no utensils...what will we do...I do not know how will we live after getting out from here,"" says the teary-eyed woman.Baby is inconsolable when she says the rain even washed away the books and certificates of her children.Baby is among thousands of people who had to leave their houses, destroyed or damaged in heavy rains, and seek refuge in relief camps.According to the latest official figures, more than 60,000 people, including women, toddlers and senior citizens, have been lodged in various relief camps across 14 districts of the southern state following the unprecedented monsoon rains that triggered floods and landslips in several places.Elsey Mathew, lodged in a relief camp in Idukki district-- one of the badly hit along with Wayanad--says she left home following landslips in the area.""Around 30 landslips occurred near my house. There was no other way than shifting to the relief camp. We had to leave home, abandoning many valuables,"" she said.Abdul Azeez and Biju, natives of Ernakulam, say a blank future stares at them as they have to rebuild their lives afresh.""Our houses have been damaged. Rain water entered every room. Wells are filled with mud and silt. Future of our children is now blank. Their books and uniforms have been washed away,"" they said.Hailing from Edaykkod in nearby Attingal, Ammu shares the heart-wrenching story of losing her tiny hut, which she got under the government's 'one-lakh housing scheme' (Laksham Veedu).Although the intensity of rains has decreased to some extent, the anxiety and fear continue to grip the people living in relief camps across the state.Many of them are scared to return, many are clueless about where to go and many are yet to get over their loss.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on Saturday announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation to those who lost their houses and land in the rain, and Rs 4 lakh to those who lost a member of their family.The toll in the monsoon fury since August 8 has climbed to 37.",2018-08-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['rs', 'relief', 'kerala', 'landslips', 'houses', 'lodged', 'thousands', 'rain', 'stare', 'floods', 'bleak', 'rains', 'lost', 'house', 'camps', 'future']",India,news article,English
910,FL-2020-000164-IND,"Hit by cyclone, Raigad district crawls back to normalcy - Hindustan Times",https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hit-by-cyclone-raigad-district-crawls-back-to-normalcy/story-NnMkyMMKJw3sPAFmoRdNQO.html,"A month after severe cyclone Nisarga left a trail of destruction along the coastal and inland tehsils of Raigad district, the overall situation has steadily improved, the district collector said.

The restoration, however, has been challenging following intense monsoon rains.

During June, Raigad recorded 545.5 mm rain, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Though it was 22% deficient for the month, it had the third-highest rainfall among all districts in Maharashtra. The district has recorded 791 confirmed cases of Covid-19, 298 recoveries, and 17 deaths so far.

According to the district administration, electricity had been restored across 1,700 of 1,976 villages in Raigad. “Non-electrified villages are mostly across Shrivardhan, Tala, Mhasla and Mangaon tehsils, which were worst-affected due to the cyclone,” said Nidhi Choudhari, district collector and magistrate, Raigad.

“The administration has been working on a war-footing for relief and restoration activities but intense monsoon rain combined with inaccessibility to electricity poles in marshy areas or mangroves has made it even more challenging for us. Also, we are keeping a close watch to ensure residents follow social distancing and safety measures during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Chaudhari.

Overall, 87% electricity restored by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL) across other 11 talukas apart from the four most affected ones. A total of 5.5 lakh of 6.35 lakh consumer’s power supply is currently in place, said Choudhari. “Teams from other districts arrived during the third week of June for restoration efforts. However, due to different topography and climate they have faced difficulties,” she said.

Choudhari said 88,000 people had been paid relief for their damaged houses in the district while 1418 of 2136 water supply schemes had been activated through electricity restoration. “Remaining areas are using generators for water supply. Hence, people aren’t facing inconvenience,” said Choudhari.

“Residents of nearby villages have either been given generators or they have managed to purchase one among three to four households. However, there is very little availability of kerosene to power them. This is still leading to a shortage of drinking water but the situation is better than before,” said Rajendra Kudekar, resident of Tala town in Mangaon.

Dattatreya Karanje, resident of Aravi village, Shrivardhan said, “It is now 28 days since there is no electricity in our village. We have been provided with a few generators that are mostly used for pumping water from bore wells. The local administration said it will take one more week to restore power. We are used to the dark and the dim candle lights.”

Alibag resident Kunal Salunkhe said, “More than relief from the state, quick intervention by residents, non-government bodies, and assistance from relatives from cities like Mumbai and Pune during the Covid-19 pandemic have helped normalise the situation. People have built more studier rooftops but unfortunately, they are still made using tin.”

The administration said they had restored network connectivity with 435 of 548 mobile towers in Raigad. “Telecom operators have powered their towers with the help of generators,” said Choudhari.

Sandeep Mendharkar from Mhasala said, “Network availability is still low. There are certain spots near villages and towns where there is a network, and this can be identified by a small crowd located there through the day across villages in Mhasla.”

The collector said relief amount had been paid for all deceased, injured citizens, livestock, and the compensation process for crop losses is underway. “In all, 12,000 hectares of crop or horticultural losses were recorded in the district. Crop compensation takes more time as land records have many names and all have to either share their account details or give consent for the transfer of relief amount to one of the occupants,” said Choudhari.

Kudekar said this was the reason why long queues were spotted at banks located in small towns. “The only functioning bank is Bank of India, and villagers from surrounding areas are queuing up to claim compensation. Some have come and returned almost five to six times until they receive their money,” he said.

Meanwhile, for the 1.6 lakh tree fall cases during the cyclone, Choudhari said all roads had been cleared. “Wood of trees cut in the wadis (farmlands or hamlets) belongs to people. Directions were given to use the wood of trees fallen by local panchayats for shamshan ghats (burial sites). For major highways and roads, the tree barks are yet to be cut as in cut into logs. Those cutting branches and taking away are using it for fuel in rural areas,” said Choudhari.

CYCLONE NISARGA: WHAT HAD HAPPENED?

Nisarga, classified as a severe cyclonic storm, made landfall at Diveagar, located between Shrivardhan and Murud between 12.15pm and 12.30pm on June 3 as it passed over Raigad district following the onset of the southwest monsoon. The wind speed during and after landfall had touched a maximum of 120 kmph leading to rooftops of several structures blown away, tree fall and power line damages, and a communication blackout across 80% of Raigad. While 1.4 lakh houses were damaged, 5.2 lakh structures were partially damaged. In addition, 1.6 lakh tree fall incidents and 16,000 electricity infrastructure damages was recorded. The district administration had calculated ₹200 crore in property destruction, including ₹40 crore losses due to power infrastructure damages. It also led to issues such as the drinking water crisis as without electricity, people were unable to pump water from bore wells.",2020-07-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['electricity', 'water', 'relief', 'power', 'cyclone', 'raigad', 'villages', 'lakh', 'normalcy', 'administration', 'tree', 'hit', 'crawls', 'district']",India,news article,English
615,Drought Sri Lanka,How Organic Farming Contributes to a Sustainable Food System - EcoWatch,https://www.ecowatch.com/how-organic-farming-contributes-to-a-sustainable-food-system-1881683536.html,"Despite a slight decline between 2009 and 2010, since 1999 the global land area farmed organically has expanded more than threefold to 37 million hectares, according to new research conducted by the Worldwatch Institute for its Vital Signs Online service. Regions with the largest certified organic agricultural land in 2010 were Oceania, including Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Island nations (12.1 million hectares); Europe (10 million hectares); and Latin America (8.4 million hectares), write report authors Catherine Ward and Laura Reynolds.

Organic farming is now established in international standards, and 84 countries had implemented organic regulations by 2010, up from 74 countries in 2009. Definitions vary, but according to the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, organic agriculture is a production system that relies on ecological processes, such as waste recycling, rather than the use of synthetic inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

“Although organic agriculture often produces lower yields on land that has recently been farmed conventionally, it can outperform conventional practices—especially in times of drought—when the land has been farmed organically for a longer time,” said Reynolds, a researcher with Worldwatch’s Food and Agriculture Program. “Conventional agricultural practices often degrade the environment over both the long and short term through soil erosion, excessive water extraction, and biodiversity loss.”

Organic farming has the potential to contribute to sustainable food security by improving nutrition intake and sustaining livelihoods in rural areas, while simultaneously reducing vulnerability to climate change and enhancing biodiversity. Sustainable practices associated with organic farming are relatively labor intensive. Organic agriculture uses up to 50 percent less fossil fuel energy than conventional farming, and common organic practices—including rotating crops, applying mulch to empty fields, and maintaining perennial shrubs and trees on farms—also stabilize soils and improve water retention, thus reducing vulnerability to harsh weather patterns. On average, organic farms have 30 percent higher biodiversity, including birds, insects and plants, than conventional farms do.

Certifications for organic agriculture are increasingly concentrated in wealthier countries. From 2009 to 2010, Europe increased its organic farmland by 9 percent to 10 million hectares, the largest growth in any region. The U.S. has lagged behind other countries in adopting sustainable farming methods. When national sales rather than production are considered, however, the U.S. organic industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the nation, expanding by 9.5 percent in 2011 to reach $31.5 billion in sales.

Sustainable food production will become increasingly important in developing countries, as the majority of population growth is concentrated in the world’s poorest countries. Agriculture in developing countries is often far more labor intensive than in industrial countries, so it is not surprising that approximately 80 percent of the 1.6 million global certified organic farmers live in the developing world. The countries with the most certified organic producers in 2010 were India (400,551 farmers), Uganda (188,625) and Mexico (128,826). Non-certified organic agriculture in developing countries is practiced by millions of indigenous people, peasants and small family farms involved in subsistence and local market-oriented production.

Further highlights from the report:

In 2010, the most recent year for which data are available, certified organic farming accounted for approximately 0.9 percent of the world’s agricultural land.

Africa is home to 3 percent of the world’s certified organic agricultural land, with just over 1 million hectares certified. Asia has 7 percent, with a total of 2.8 million hectares.

Despite a decline in organically farmed land in China and India between 2009 and 2010, India’s export volume of organic produce increased by 20 percent.

1129,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Find lasting solution to protect the environment - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/oped/editorial/find-lasting-solution-to-protect-the-environment-3403780,"By Editor More by this Author

Last Monday, Water and Environment was one of the ministries that presented their performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM manifesto.

The ministry’s director for water resources management, Dr Florence Grace Odongo, revealed that the water levels on Lake Victoria have risen to 13.4 metres short of 8cm to reach last year’s levels and yet the rainy season has just started. People living on river banks and lake shores were, therefore, warned to vacate the areas before floods begin to rage.

Such warnings have become an annual repetition albeit in good faith as they are meant to avoid loss of lives and property.

Unfortunately, they are usually taken lightly by the audience for whom they are intended.

But then again, these people rightly referred to as encroachers would not even be there in the first place if environment laws were observed. Clearly, there seems to a problem when it comes to implementation of laws.

In a Daily Monitor story of May 14 titled, “Govt issues flood alerts, tells lakeside residents to vacate”, Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, says one of the reasons they have not been able to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands is because of low enforcement of laws which is exacerbated by the fact that there are few enforcement officers under the environment protection police unit.

In a statement on the rising water levels of Lake Victoria and the Nile system last year in May, Mr Cheptoris directed that people living within the protection zones of wetlands, lakes, rivers, and forest reserves vacate with immediate effect.

He said the ministry was working with the Ministry of Local Government and other government agencies to evict people living within 100 metres of river banks, 30 metres of wetlands and 200 metres of lake shores, and in forest reserves.

He said the respective government offices, from the central to local levels, up to the sub-county and parish levels, has been informed about the directive and requested to take the required actions with immediate effect.

Was there an attempt to implement these directives in spite of the shortage of enforcement officers? What action is being taken against encroachers and how is government making sure that they do not settle in those areas again? How can the communities near the said areas be involved in stopping encroachment?

It would be prudent to present an audit of whether these directives were successfully implemented and if not, what can be done this time to get a better results.

This way, we can avoid repetitions of the same directives year after year with no lasting solutions.

1263,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Coastal flooding will disproportionately impact 31 million people globally - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/iu-cfw100120.php,"Study is first to assess the impact of climate change on the global population of river deltas

Thirty-one million people living in river deltas are at high risk of experiencing flooding and other impacts from tropical cyclones and climate change, according to a study by Indiana University researchers.

""To date, no one has successfully quantified the global population on river deltas and assessed the cumulative impacts from climate change,"" said Douglas Edmonds, the Malcolm and Sylvia Boyce Chair in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and lead author on the study. ""Since river deltas have long been recognized as hotspots of population growth, and with increasing impacts from climate change, we realized we needed to properly quantify what the cumulative risks are in river deltas.""

The findings are the result of a collaboration facilitated by IU's Institute for Advanced Study with support from the Environmental Resilience Institute.

The team’s analysis shows that river deltas occupy 0.5 percent of the earth’s land surface, yet they contain 4.5 percent of the global population—a total of 339 million people. Because river deltas form at the ocean at or below sea level, they are highly prone to storm surges, which are expected to occur more frequently due to climate change-fueled sea-level rise and coastal flooding.

In the study, IU researchers analyzed these geographic regions, which include cities like New Orleans, Bangkok, and Shanghai, using a new global dataset to determine how many people live on river deltas, how many are vulnerable to a 100-year storm surge event, and the ability of the deltas to naturally mitigate impacts of climate change.

“River deltas present special challenges for predicting coastal floods that deserve more attention in discussions about the future impacts of climate change,” said IU Distinguished Professor of Anthropology Eduardo Brondizio, a co-author of the study who has been working with rural and urban communities in the Amazon delta for 3 decades. “Our estimates are likely a minimum because the storm surge and flooding models do not account for the compound interactions of the climate impacts, deficient infrastructure, and high population density.”

With Edmonds and Brondizio, co-authors on the study include Rebecca Caldwell and graduate student Sacha Siani.

In addition to the threat of flooding, many of the residents in river deltas are low-income and experience water, soil, and air pollution, poor and subnormal housing infrastructure, and limited access to public services. According to the study, of the 339 million people living on deltas throughout the world, 31 million of these people are living in the 100-year storm surge floodplains. To make matters worse, 92 percent of the 31 million live in developing or least-developed economies. As a result, some of the most disadvantaged populations are among the most at-risk to the impacts of climate change.

“These communities are already dealing with health risks, lack of sanitation and services, poverty, and exposure to flooding and other environmental risks. Climate change is exacerbating all of these issues and creating more impacts,” Brondizio said.

To conduct their study, the researchers created a global dataset of delta populations and areas, aggregating 2,174 delta locations. They then cross-referenced the dataset with a land population count to determine how many people were living in the deltas. To determine the natural mitigation capacity of the deltas, researchers looked at the volume of incoming sediment deposited by rivers and other waterways flowing out to sea. The volume of incoming sediment was compared to the relative area of the delta to determine if the delta would be considered sediment starved and thus unable to naturally mitigate flooding.

Decades of engineering have expanded the habitable land area of river deltas, but they’ve also starved the regions of flood-preventing sediment. Without the sediment being renewed naturally, the shorelines will continue to recede, worsening the impacts of storm surges

“To effectively prepare for more intense future coastal flooding, we need to reframe it as a problem that disproportionately impacts people on river deltas in developing and least-developed economies,” said Edmonds. “We need better models for the climate impacts that are capable of stimulating compound flooding in densely populated areas so that exposure and risk can be mapped to more accurately assess risk and vulnerability.”

Story continues below advertisement

This year, his crews are busy raising a road in Fort McMurray that runs alongside the Clearwater River, one of two major waterways running through town. Once it is elevated, it will do double duty as a dike and a major arterial road – all part of a network of flood defences currently under construction or being designed in this northern Alberta city.

This race is one that Mr. Hough intends to win.

Asked what existed before, he laughs, before saying, “Nothing. There simply wasn’t these kind of defences in place.”

If all goes according to plan, in a few years Fort McMurray will be a walled city. The anticipated cost: nearly $300-million.

To put that figure into perspective, consider that a 2006 provincial committee recommended a suite of flood-mitigation measures across the entire province – safeguarding 54 municipalities – whose total cost was just more than $300-million. The price tag for Fort McMurray, which Wood Buffalo will pay almost entirely on its own, is also more than double the tab for relocating buildings out of floodways across the whole of southern Alberta after devastating floods ravaged the province in 2013.

Fort Mac’s dikes might be the largest Canadian flood-prevention project you’ve never heard of.

The project is also something of an anachronism. “The era of big structural defence developments was really the 1950s and sixties,” says Jason Thistlethwaite, professor at the University of Waterloo’s School of Environment, Enterprise and Development. “None of these structures offers absolute protection. So there’s been a real move away from building these defenses and a shift toward what the Dutch are doing: ‘Making room for the river’ "" – an approach that includes government-funded buyouts of properties in flood-prone areas, and measures to prohibit new development that would sit in harm’s way.

But retreat is no longer a viable option for Fort Mac. Having allowed development in its floodplain for decades, half of its downtown, often referred to as the Lower Townsite, now lies there. If the city “made room for the river,"" there wouldn’t be much room left for anything else.

If it seems absurd that a community would knowingly build itself in harm’s way, Fort McMurray’s situation is by no means unique in Canada. Neighborhoods in Fredericton have long existed in the floodplain of the Saint John River. Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que., although inadequately protected by an existing dike, expanded onto an area vulnerable to flooding from the Lake of Two Mountains. And hundreds of homes and small businesses along the Ottawa River, including in the nation’s capital, are dangerously exposed. All those communities experienced severe flooding this spring.

Fort McMurray’s story illuminates how and why communities of perfectly rational people can build directly in harm’s way – and illustrates, as well, the high costs of addressing the mistake of doing so.

Fort McMurray’s dilemma has been 150 years in the making.

The city sits near the confluence of the Athabasca and Clearwater rivers, where the Hudson’s Bay Co. set up shop in 1870 to take advantage of these crucial transportation corridors.

But the site was not without its drawbacks. According to municipal documents, Fort McMurray has suffered at least 15 notable floods since 1835 – all but one of them caused by ice jams. As ice along the two waterways breaks up and moves downstream in spring, chunks of it can pile up where the rivers meet. That can cause water levels to rise swiftly, as many as several metres along the Clearwater River, inundating the Lower Townsite.

Over the decades, various options were explored for controlling river ice, including hydroelectric dams, water-storage basins and diversion projects along the Athabasca River. Dikes were contemplated several times, including in the early 1980s, and again around 2000.

Nothing came of any of those plans.

And although some Canadian communities have turned to specialized heavy machinery to manage spring breakup, Wood Buffalo deems such methods ineffective. “We’re really at the mercy of nature,” Mr. Hough says. “There’s no use in explosives or punching holes in the surface [of the ice]. There’s no potential for breaking up the river ourselves.”

(It’s unclear how a warming climate will influence future ice-jam floods in Fort McMurray; academics who have studied this question have found that their severity might actually be reduced. In any case, there are too many variables, and too much uncertainty, to make a reliable forecast.)

But if building on an unprotected floodplain seemed unwise, Fort Mac had few alternatives. The surrounding region features large tracts of muskeg and unstable slopes, leaving little viable land for development.

And so what began as a handful of small log buildings gradually morphed into an assortment of big-box stores, condominium complexes and houses with finished basements. Then, after 2000, things really took off: The city’s population doubled over the subsequent decade. Development in the Lower Townsite intensified even as new subdivisions sprouted on higher ground to the northwest.

All levels of government knew what was happening.

Back in the 1990s, Alberta joined a federal initiative called the Flood Damage Reduction Program. The underlying bargain: In exchange for federal funding for flood-mapping initiatives, the province would discourage further development in high-risk areas.

As part of that initiative, in 1993, Alberta’s Environment Ministry recommended that 250 metres above sea level be adopted as the design flood level for Fort McMurray – a move that would have effectively halted further development in the Lower Townsite, large parts of which lie below that elevation.

But that designation of floodplains as flood-hazard areas never happened.

Merwan Saher, Alberta’s Auditor-General, warned in a March, 2015, report that although Alberta Environment had identified and mapped 48 flood-hazard areas, most – including Fort McMurray – hadn’t been officially designated as off-limits for development. Politics, he said, was to blame. “The lack of designation often reflects a lack of local community support,” Mr. Saher noted, “and the department’s reluctance to impose designation of a community that does not want it.”

By effectively surrendering floodplain regulation to municipalities, Alberta made the same mistake that virtually every Canadian province has made at some time or another, often repeatedly. For local officials, the impulse to allow development in vulnerable areas can be almost irresistible. In the words of one federal document, local authorities “are subject to perverse incentives; they benefit from property development fees and annual property taxes."" Meanwhile, it’s the provinces and the feds who get stuck with most of the tab for helping flooded communities recover.

To assess what’s at risk in Fort McMurray, The Globe and Mail acquired high-resolution satellite imagery of the Lower Townsite from 2017 (as well as of the flood-prone Waterways neighborhood immediately to the southeast). We imported that imagery into Picterra, a web-based machine-learning tool that we used to identify buildings (everything from homes, garages and apartment buildings to office and industrial buildings, shopping malls and big-box stores). We then manually added buildings that the tool missed. All told, we identified more than 3,300 structures.

The Globe also acquired data from the provincial government depicting areas expected to go underwater during a 1-in-100 year flood – that is, a flood that has a 1-per-cent chance of occurring in any given year. Using ArcGIS Pro, a geographical-information-system software package, we identified more than 730 structures within the floodplain. We found another 560 structures within the so-called “flood fringe” – where floodwaters would be shallower and slower moving, and thus less threatening.

It appears that approximately 40 per cent of the structures in the Lower Townsite and Waterways are directly in harm’s way.

Several years ago, the municipality began pondering how to revitalize the downtown, increase its population fourfold (to 48,000) and create an arts-and-entertainment hub that would be “the envy of most other large urban centres” across the continent. The municipality wanted more shops, office buildings and homes. Plans grew increasingly ambitious over time, with visions of a $580-million, 6,200-seat sports arena and extensive waterfront development.

The official plan did nod to the city’s history of flooding: It included raising a road along the Clearwater River to double as a dike. But at 248.5 metres above sea level, according to one municipal document, this would provide only “basic flood protection for the 40-year flood level.” (A flood with a 40-year return period has a 64-per-cent probability of occurring in any 40-year period, and an 83-per-cent chance of occurring within 70 years.) In other words, the municipality essentially accepted that occasional catastrophic flooding would remain a fact of living in Fort Mac.

That attitude, however, became untenable after Alberta suffered the worst floods in its history, in June, 2013. The damage in Fort McMurray from the swelling Hangingstone River (one of the city’s smaller rivers, which empties into the Clearwater) amounted to a relatively minor cost of millions of dollars. Heritage Park, a collection of relocated historic buildings showcasing the region’s pre-oil history, turned into a muddy bog. Old wooden floors and foundations suffered extensive damage. The park did not reopen for four years.

This was no ice-jam flood. But those communities in southern Alberta that had similarly allowed unchecked floodplain development suffered recovery costs estimated at more than $5-billion, including more than $200-million in disaster-assistance payments.

That stung.

As often happens after major disasters, politicians vowed to learn from past mistakes. The province committed itself to the principle that it’s easier to keep people away from flooding than it is to keep floodwater away from people. Henceforth, development in high-risk areas would be restricted.

But for Fort McMurray, it was too late to reverse course. Blocking floodplain development there would have meant abandoning the city’s vision for a revitalized Lower Townsite. And Alberta’s emerging regulatory environment granted significant exemptions to certain municipalities, including Fort McMurray, that had “special circumstances.” Don Scott, then the local MLA, told local news media that the province didn’t want to “sterilize” the city’s downtown.

For McMurray’s aversion to retreat was further demonstrated after the cataclysmic 2016 wildfires that destroyed 2,400 homes. More than 200 of those burned in the flood-prone Waterways neighborhood, creating a rare opportunity to remove people from harm’s way. And yet, Wood Buffalo rejected the idea out of hand. “The [municipality] will not be entertaining buyouts from residents within the flood hazard area,” reads one municipal presentation given to Waterways residents in December, 2016. To encourage rebuilding, the municipality even repealed a bylaw that required special flood-proofing measures for newly constructed homes.

Instead, the city committed itself to the principal of keeping the floodwater away from the people: Fort Mac manned the barricades. The municipality hired a consultant to design a series of dikes, elevated roads and retaining walls around the Lower Townsite and Waterways neighbourhoods, to be completed by 2017.

But even that plan was soon interrupted – by falling oil prices. Oil sands companies significantly reduced investment, which rippled throughout the regional economy. Tax revenue began falling well below expectations, a trend that’s expected to continue.

So, Wood Buffalo considered other options. Officials briefly mooted creating a city-backed flood-insurance scheme. Mindful that dikes block views of the river, they also considered demountable transparent walls that would be erected every flood season; that idea was discarded after it became apparent how heavy the walls would have to be to withstand the awesome power of ice jams. And some suggested building to the lower 1-in-40-year standard, a move that would have saved an estimated $60-million in outlays – but that still played chicken with fortune.

Fort McMurray is topping its new defences at 250.5 metres above sea level – slightly above the 1-in-100-year flood level. Even then, it’s taking a gamble. During the worst flood on record, in 1875, rivers peaked at an estimated 252 metres. If floodwaters ever did overtop them, the dikes could make matters worse by trapping water inside the city.

But that disaster has been estimated as a 1-in-350-year event. Karl-Erich Lindenschmidt, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan’s Global Institute for Water Security, who specializes in river ice, thinks Fort Mac is building its dikes to a reasonable elevation. He has modelled ice-jam floods in the community and determined that there’s a limit to how high waters could rise before the force would overwhelm an ice jam and flush it downstream: It’s about 250 metres. “I think that’s a very viable and defendable water level,” he says.

Flood defences on this scale are rare in Canada, but they can work.

Manitoba’s Red River Floodway was completed in 1968 at a cost of $63-million, equivalent to about $450-million in today’s currency. It’s been called one of the largest, most important infrastructure projects in Canada’s history, and multiple studies suggest it has paid for itself many times over. Alberta is now planning new reservoirs on the Elbow and Bow Rivers to protect Calgary, a similarly massive undertaking. Calgary bets it will avoid $10 of flooding damage for every dollar it spends on its own massive infrastructure project.

One certain bet: Fort McMurray will be living with the implications of its decision for generations.

Tim Haney is a sociology professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary who studies how neighborhoods and communities respond to floods and other disasters. He acknowledges that buyouts and zoning restrictions enjoy little political support. But structural defences have their own problems, he says, one being that they encourage developers, municipalities and homeowners to take even greater risks than they did before, because they assume the new berms, dikes and floodwalls will work.

That false sense of security is often compounded, over time, by the fact that flood defences tend to be inadequately maintained – a situation that’s been repeated right across the country.

According to a 2015 analysis by Vancouver-based Ebbwater Consulting, 315,000 people live on the floodplain of the Lower Fraser River in British Columbia. Richmond, Delta and Coquitlam were found to be particularly vulnerable. The dikes protecting many low-lying neighborhoods, the study said, were built decades ago and have been long neglected. Governments must now decide whether to upgrade or replace them, at great expense.

Ontario’s Conservation Authorities operate more than 900 dams, dikes and other structures worth an estimated $2.7-billion. A 2013 report by Conservation Ontario, a non-profit association that represents the authorities, claimed that they received less than half the amount necessary to adequately maintain them. Now, they’ll have to make do with even less: This year, the Progressive Conservative government of Doug Ford slashed their flood-management funding in half.

Protected from the Lake of Two Mountains by a small dike, Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Que., expanded over the past few decades from a resort town to a small city of 18,000. This spring, thousands of homes flooded after that dike failed. The mayor promised a taller, stronger dike.

Some argue that Canadians’ faith in engineered solutions has become excessive. “What I’d very much like to see is, around Canada, for us to have a more useful discussion about where that build/no-build line actually is,"" Prof. Haney says. “Maybe there are certain places we just shouldn’t be letting people live.”

He may get his wish. Few Canadian communities can afford what Fort McMurray is doing – even when higher levels of government offer to help pay. A year ago, the federal government unveiled a $2-billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund to support projects costing more than $20-million. And yet, by the time the application period closed on May 31, Infrastructure Canada had approved only $1.2-billion in disbursements, most of that going to large cities such as Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto. Earlier this year, federal officials expressed surprise that they hadn’t received more applications.

Deterred by the costs of large-scale projects, “the lower-tier governments aren’t interested in applying for it,” says University of Waterloo’s Prof. Thistlethwaite. “I think we’re seeing the end of that emphasis on these bigger structural defences.""",2019-06-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['building', 'dikes', 'floodplain', 'lower', 'mcmurray', 'river', 'buildings', 'moves', 'rivers', 'capricious', 'development', 'waterways', 'fortress', 'city', 'flood', 'fort', 'protect', 'decades']",Canada,news article,English
441,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Reducing climate impacts in West Africa - Mali - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/reducing-climate-impacts-west-africa,"Recognizing that Africa is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the World Meteorological Organization has launched the Training Programme on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction in Agriculture to improve the capacity of national technical services in West African countries. The programme seeks to reduce the impacts of natural disasters and climate change on the agricultural sector and to support sustainable development.

“Climate change is threatening food security in many parts of the world,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “This new training program will make a significant contribution to strengthening the capacity of the technical services of West African countries to address the impacts and risks of climate change on agriculture through early warning systems and climate prediction.”

The partners for the project are two WMO Regional Training Centers: the Institute of Biometeorology of the Italian National Research Council (CNRIBIMET), represented at the inaugural ceremony at WMO by the Italian Ambassador, His Excellency Ambassador Maurizio Serra and by IBIMET Director Mr Antonio Raschiand, and the AGRHYMET Regional Center, represented by Mr Etienne Saar.

The project will be implemented in the 15 member states of ECOWAS (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo) plus in Mauritania and Chad. With a budget of some €820 000, the 12-month project will focus on training experts from national agriculture, agro-meteorological, hydrological and early warning services.

The project will organize training courses for technicians and experts of national services in order to develop effective climate services for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The main objective of the training is to enhance the participants' ability to plan and adopt strategies to mitigate the effects of these phenomena and to harmonize the methods of analysis, thereby strengthening cooperation at regional level.

The project will also consolidate a network among scientific and technical institutions in order to work on shared methodologies and to create an objective and harmonized base of information. The aim is to transfer and share the know-how, to expand cooperation in sensitive areas to the national and regional level and to promote exchanges and collaboration.

Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts in the world because of its widespread poverty and its limited adaptation ability. Since the 1990s, the issue of natural disasters has gained international visibility. In addition, because much of West Africa’s growing population relies on rain-fed agriculture, the region is vulnerable to crises that can turn into humanitarian disasters, such as the one that hit East Africa in 2011 when a long period of extreme drought threatened the survival of millions of people.",2017-04-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'training', 'national', 'climate', 'world', 'project', 'regional', 'agriculture', 'impacts', 'mali', 'reducing', 'change', 'services', 'west']",Ghana,news article,English
741,FL-2016-000114-EGY,13 dead as flooding hits southwestern France - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/13-dead-as-flooding-hits-southwestern-france/,"At least 13 people died as violent rainstorms turned rivers into raging torrents in southwestern France on Monday in the latest episode of wild weather in Europe, officials said.

Flash floods swamped a number of towns and villages around the fortress city of Carcassonne, leaving a trail of overturned cars, damaged roads and collapsed homes.

An elderly nun was swept to her death as rising waters smashed through a nunnery in the village of Villardonnel to the north of Carcassonne. Meanwhile, at least four people died overnight in the hard-hit village of Villegailhenc, local authorities said Monday. As Prime Minister Edouard Philippe headed to the scene, the French interior ministry said a total of 13 people had died after the equivalent of three months’ of rainfall in just a few hours.

“There’s water everywhere in the house. Everything is flooded,” Helene Segura told AFP by telephone from Villegailhenc where at least one small bridge had collapsed.

“When I look out the window, I can only see water and mud everywhere. It’s sad when you’re 70 years’ old like me and you need to redo your house, change the furniture and all the upholstery,” she said.

Authorities rushed in helicopters and 600 firemen to help with rescue operations, particularly those in the floodplain of the Aude river which hit its highest level in 100 years, according to the Vigicrues flood agency.

In the town of Trebes, near Carcassonne, the water in the Aude rose eight meters (26 feet) in just five hours, officials said. Around 1,000 people were evacuated in the area of Pezens, also near Carcassonne in the Aude area, due to fears that a nearby dam could burst.

The storms were triggered when a front of warm and humid air from the Mediterranean Sea slammed into colder air around the Massif central mountain range in central France, inundating an area from the eastern Pyrenees to Aveyron further north.

Violent storms on Sunday also hit Portugal, leaving 28 with minor injuries and hundreds of thousands without power amid flooding in the region around the capital Lisbon.

The heavy rain, which later rolled on through Spain, was the tail end of hurricane Leslie in the Atlantic which weakened to a post-tropical storm as it made landfall. Last week, an unrelated weather system moving across the Mediterranean left 12 dead in the Spanish island of Majorca and another two died in southeastern France.

Firemen responded to more than 250 calls overnight, as 160 to 180 mm (6 to 7 inches) of rain fell within five hours in Carcassonne.",2018-10-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['storms', 'area', 'dead', 'water', 'weather', 'aude', 'village', 'flooding', '13', 'villegailhenc', 'rain', 'died', 'france', 'southwestern', 'carcassonne', 'hits']",Egypt,news article,English

Urges residents in coastal areas to relocate, predicts 261 days of rainfall

By Olasunkanmi Akoni

Lagos State Government, yesterday, predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with attendant flooding across the state, even as it directed residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas of the state to move upland to avert needless loss of lives and property.

Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, accompanied by Special Adviser to the Governor on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said this at a media briefing on the 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions, and Socio-Economic implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja.

Bello said: The forecast for 2021 is based on the informed global consensus that el-Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, is at the cool phase, which will continue till around June and likely give to a dominant el-Nino phase till the end of 2021.

Generally, the Seasonal Climate Prediction for Lagos State signifies that on-set dates ranged between March 17 in the earliest, and April 6, while the season-ending may range between November 20 and December 5, 2021.

READ ALSO:

The connotation is that Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while the maximum annual rainfall amount is predicted to be 1,747mm.

It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicates that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.

Besides, he said the state government is collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMET, in downscaling the predictions to all stakeholders.

Also speaking, Mr. Igbokwe, stated that the government planned to dredge about 221 collector drains, 32 primary channels measuring about 72kilometres spread across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to checkmate flooding.

I, therefore, urge residents to support the government to achieve a flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again been littered by residents, Igbokwe said.

But the rescues have begun - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/12/world/giraffe-rescue-kenya-cnnphotos/index.html,"Asiwa the giraffe is ferried off a flooded island in Kenya. She was blindfolded to keep her calm during the trip.

Asiwa the giraffe is ferried off a flooded island in Kenya. She was blindfolded to keep her calm during the trip.

Time was running out for Asiwa, a Rothschildâ??s giraffe in western Kenya.

For years, she and seven other giraffes had been living on a peninsula that reached out into Lake Baringo. But rising lake levels, caused by relentless rain, had gradually turned the peninsula into an island, leaving the animals stranded.

It was especially grim for Asiwa, who was stuck on a marshy part of the island, separated from the other giraffes with only about an acre of land to forage for food. And the flooding was only getting worse.

She needed to be rescued.

Mike Parkei, a ranger for the Ruko Conservancy, looks after the eight giraffes stranded on an island in Kenya.

Asiwa is attended to after being hit with a tranquilizer dart on the day of her rescue. She was not hurt; she just had to be sedated before being guided to the barge.

Conservationists have teamed up with Kenyan wildlife authorities and local members of the community to start moving the giraffes off the island and into a new sanctuary within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

Asiwa was the first to be ferried to safety last week, taking about an hourlong ride on a custom-made steel barge. A second giraffe, Pasaka, was rescued the day after Asiwa.

But itâ??s not so easy to move these gentle giants.

â??They don't know that you're trying to help them,â? said David Oâ??Connor, the president of Save Giraffes Now who has been actively participating in the rescue efforts. â??They think you're a predator. So they're really trying to work against you, which makes it even harder.â?

The initial hope, Oâ??Connor said, was that theyâ??d be able to coax the giraffes onto the barge by putting mangoes and other treats there. But because of the rainy season, thereâ??s been an abundance of food on the island. The treats would not be enough.

That meant the giraffes would have to be hit with a tranquilizer dart â?? and that is an especially dangerous proposition because of their anatomy. Oâ??Connor said that when giraffes go down on the ground, they can choke on their own saliva, or their brains can be damaged by the changes in blood pressure. So itâ??s important that once the giraffe falls, a vet is there to immediately counteract the drug with a reversal drug.

â??It's not like an elephant or a rhino where you just dart it, it flops over and it's fine,â? he said. â??The giraffes, they're kind of like a Formula One car. You can't mess with their innards too much or they really have problems.â?

Pasaka, a younger giraffe, was rescued a day after Asiwa.

The rescue mission was a collaborative effort involving the Kenya Wildlife Service, local community members, and conservationists with Save Giraffes Now and the Northern Rangelands Trust.

Rescuers keep a close eye on Pasaka before helping her to the barge.

Asiwa went down in thick acacia brush, probably as far away from the barge as possible. But the team was there immediately to attend to her needs.

They put guide ropes around her shoulders and a blindfold over her eyes to keep her calm.

â??She was incredible,â? Oâ??Connor said. â??She's a very, very tough girl. â?¦ Once we got her onto a more open space where there was an established track, she just walked straight onto the barge. Sometimes it looked like someone was walking a puppy on a Sunday afternoon. It was amazing.â?

Asiwa is guided to a waiting barge.

The rescued giraffes are being moved to a new sanctuary at the Ruko Conservancy, where they will be protected from poachers and predators.

It was smooth sailing on the barge, with Asiwaâ??s head poking over the high walls. She still had her blindfold on, and socks were put in her ears to block out sound.

She was surrounded by Oâ??Connor and the other rescue workers, who kept their voices low and focused intently on the job at hand.

â??Although it got all our hearts pounding at the beginning of the sedation, at the end of it, it was absolutely perfect,â? he said. â??And Asiwa was absolutely wonderful on the barge ride over. I think she was built for the sea.â?

Boats surround Asiwaâ??s barge on the day of her rescue.

David Oâ??Connor, the president of Save Giraffes Now, keeps an eye on Asiwa.

Photographer Ami Vitale documented Asiwaâ??s rescue mission and was there once the barge reached the mainland.

â??The wonderful part was watching her gently amble off the boat once the blindfold was released as if nothing had happened,â? Vitale said. â??It really was a scene that could have been biblical.â?

There was a celebration at the Ruko Conservancy, which was formed in 2006 by two formerly warring communities.

â??The plan was to make the giraffe a symbol of unity and peace to end their long-standing conflict,â? said Vitale, a National Geographic photographer whose work often reminds us of how our fate is intertwined with the fate of other species.

Since she started documenting a story about one of the worldâ??s last white rhinos in 2009, Vitale has focused on wildlife and conservation efforts. Her latest book shows how China is trying to save pandas from extinction.

â??My hope is that these images can inspire people and remind them that this is the only home we have,â? she said. â??We have poked some big holes in our shared little life raft. What happens next is in all of our hands.â?

Pasaka was the second of eight planned rescues.

Rescuers move Pasaka to safety.

Six giraffes still remain on the flooded island in Kenya, but the plan is to save them by the end of January.

The Rothchildâ??s giraffe is an endangered subspecies. Because of poaching and habitat loss, only about 2,000 of them remain in Africa â?? 800 in Kenya â?? according to Oâ??Connor.

â??The hope is that this is just the first step of reintroducing these giraffes back to their historical home across the Western Rift Valley, hopefully over the next 20-30 years,â? he said.

Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri.

At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnams Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.

It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.

A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.

They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.

For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.

At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday.

By Rina Chandran

April 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Slum dwellers in the Pakistani city of Karachi have stopped the demolition of thousands of homes by mapping flood risks from clogged drains, offering a feasible solution to other informal settlements facing climate change impacts, urban experts said.

After unexpectedly heavy rains flooded much of Karachi last year, authorities said some slum settlements would be removed to allow drains to be widened, with hundreds of homes in Manzoor Colony settlement earmarked for demolition.

Residents, who had always insisted that the flooding was mainly caused by drains blocked with rubbish and sludge, teamed up with non-profit organisations to map the drainage network.

""They generated their own evidence to uncover the reasons  overlooked by authorities  why Karachi floods,"" said Arif Hasan, an architect and planner who backed the mapping project.

""The communities believed that if these obstructions are removed and the drains are cleaned and maintained, flooding will not take place,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

About 12 million people out of Karachi's 16 million population live in informal settlements, and are increasingly vulnerable as Pakistan's largest city faces worsening inundations as the South Asian monsoon brings extreme weather.

Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub, has a network of 550 stormwater drains that criss-cross the city and empty into the Arabian Sea. Many are blocked by illegal construction and waste.

Authorities say they clean out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide funds. The unusually heavy rains killed dozens, submerged main roads and inundated hundreds of homes.

To map Manzoor Colony's drains, a team from the non-profit Technical Training Resource Center (TTRC) walked along them with residents, photographing, marking and mapping more than a dozen blockages.

Their map showed only about 40 houses needed to be removed to leave the drains clear, said Mohammad Sirajuddin, head of TTRC, who led the mapping project.

""The authorities said thousands of houses would need to be demolished, but our maps showed otherwise,"" he said.

In November, residents successfully halted the planned demolitions in Manzoor Colony.

While it is not certain whether authorities will use the community's flood risk map in the future, the residents now know where the choke points are and how they can tackle the dangers, Sirajuddin said.

Two other informal settlements in Karachi are being mapped, with residents - especially young people - trained, he said, adding that the model can be replicated across the country.

These maps also generate crucial data on households, said Nausheen Anwar, director of Karachi Urban Lab, a think-tank.

""The maps provide a process through which consensus can be built and inclusion of all residents can be negotiated to stave off evictions and establish a basis for just compensation and resettlement,"" she said.

By 2030, more than half of Pakistan's projected 250 million population are expected to live in cities, compared to 36% now, according to the United Nations.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had pledged to build 5 million affordable homes within five years to address a chronic shortage, with housing rights groups warning that poorer residents face evictions as pressure on land increases.

""When youths in the settlements are trained in mapping, they better understand the risks they face,"" said TTRC's Sirajuddin.

""They understand their rights, and can fight evictions.""

Charging documents state Brittanie Mae Miloshevsky was found passed out in the driver’s seat on June 8 after having crashed into a pond at Golf The Round golf course located at 3300 South 600 West.

Officers who were on scene said as the woman woke, they asked her multiple times if anyone was in the car with her and she repeatedly told them no but that she was taking her kids somewhere to drop them off.

Several officers dove into the water where they found her 18-month-old son still strapped in his car seat. They were able to retrieve the baby and rush him to the hospital but he was pronounced dead when they arrived.

Reconstruction reports of the crash indicated that Miloshesky ran a red light at 3300 South 700 West and went through the fencing entering the golf course. Once inside the fence, police said Milishesky drove around the golf course and into the pond, documents state.

According to charging documents, during her interview with police, Miloshesky said she remembered going to a home where she smoked marijuana and then went to another house where she had approximately six shots of alcohol within a two hour period and smoke more marijuana.

The woman said she felt okay to drive even though those at the house encouraged her to spend the night. Witnesses said Miloshesky slipped out of the house and left while they were in another room.

Toxicology reports show Miloshesky had a blood alcohol level of .21% and active THC in her system at the time of the crash.

Floods in Bihar and Assam have killed at least 170 people and affected 1.07 crore others till Monday. More than 104 have died in Bihar alone, with a further 66 lives lost in Assam and over 1,500 relief camps opened across both states. It has also killed over 200 animals, including 16 endangered rhinos in Kaziranga National Park, and led to the Brahmaputra and Baghmati rivers flowing above danger marks.

The trail of destruction across both states has also affected Bollywood actors Manoj Bajpayee and Adil Hussain, who are from Bihar and Assam respectively, on a personal level, with the two telling NDTV that floods had forced their respective families to abandon their homes.

""I've seen this happen every year. This time water entered my brother's house, which my brother and I built in Goalpara town, and my mother had to be carried to higher ground. But there are way worse situations. People have died,"" Adil Hussain, 55, said, questioning the lack of political action and the reason behind it, ""I cannot understand why we haven't found a long-term solution.""

An emotional Manoj Bajpayee, 50, whose parents' home was flooded two years ago, also stressed on the need for long-term solutions, urging elected representatives of people in flood-affected areas to act.

""I'm more than concerned. I am angry. Some of the pictures I have seen on social media are heart-wrenching. People are dying every year. That is the concern,"" he added, ""Are we willing to put all our resources and experts on the table to find a solution? The political and bureaucratic intent is essential. For god's sake, elected representatives must act. Please sit down and find a solution.""

""The political will is always important. The representation of the people who are suffering must take it up with the centre. It is a sad situation that an actor in Mumbai is representing them,"" a clearly emotional Mr Bajpayee said.

""These are not problems that have come suddenly - they have been happening for more than 40-50 years. Look at Baghmati River which floods every year - it has been killing people and ruining crops. What are we doing about it?"" he continued.

Mr Hussain said he found it difficult to accept that with all the resources at hand, the government had been unable to respond effectively to an annual floods crisis.

""I cannot buy that. I should not be sitting here talking about floods. I am actor. People who have been voted to power, have been given professional salaries, They should do their job. Why aren't they doing their job. That is my question,"" Mr Hussain said.

Both Manoj Bajpayee and Adil Hussain also declared themselves ready to become part of a film on floods, with Mr Bajpayee also warning that individual or collective action by civil society was not an answer to the problem.

The year 2020 will, without a shadow of a doubt, be etched into the collective memory of human society for a long, long time. It began with the novel coronavirus emerging out of China’s Wuhan and reaching all corners of Earth. It's only now, with the year coming to an end, that the world has begun its retort against COVID-19 through vaccination drives.

While a majority of the global population remained indoors all year to escape the clutches of the pandemic, natural disasters were out in full force, confronting many parts of the world with a catastrophic double whammy.

Here are five such major natural calamities from across the world in the bleak year that was 2020:

Locust Attacks in East Africa and Asia

The 2020 locust outbreak was the worst Kenya has seen in 70 years, and the worst in 25 years for countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and India. It began in May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu produced heavy rains over a vast, unpopulated desert in the southern Arabian Peninsula, thereby allowing locusts to breed there undetected. Thereafter, Cyclone Luban in October 2018 exacerbated the locust breeding, enabling three generations of locusts to mass-reproduce over a nine-month period. This led to an 8,000-fold increase in the locust population across the Arabian desert.

These mega-swarms then began migrating as per the wind direction, and by April 2020, the aerial armies had successfully invaded 23 countries—African nations like Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda; Arabian countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia; Paraguay and Argentina in South America; and South Asian nations such as Iran, Pakistan, and India.

The outbreak in India began in late 2019 and January 2020, with kilometre-wide swarms disrupting lives across ten states—Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.

Subsequently, the Rajasthan government reported crop damage of 33%, while less than 33% crop damage was reported by the governments of Haryana (6520-hectare area), Madhya Pradesh (4400 ha), Maharashtra (806 ha), Uttar Pradesh (488 ha), and Uttarakhand (267 ha).

Bushfires in Australia

Bushfires in Australia tend to be a regular and widespread occurrence. However, the fires witnessed on the continent last summer—towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020—were unusually intense and far more destructive, earning this bushfire season the name ‘Black Summer’. While both natural and manmade causes started these fires, factors like high temperatures, drought conditions, high fuel load (accumulation of fallen bark, leaf litter, small branches), and global warming combined to enhance this disaster.

These raging bushfires led to tremendous destruction across the eastern half of the country, burning an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forests, destroying over 5,900 buildings, and directly killing at least 34 people. A further 445 fatalities were caused due to smoke inhalation, and 65,000 people were displaced, as this disaster affected nearly 80 per cent of Australians one way or another.

The fires also reportedly killed or affected at least 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs, also pushing some threatened species such as the long-footed potoroo, the marsupial, and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo closer to extinction! These ecological consequences aside, the bushfires also caused tremendous air pollution and carbon emission.

Overall, economists estimate the 2020 bushfires may have cost over 103 billion Australian Dollars in property damage and economic losses, thereby making them Australia's costliest natural disaster to date.

Cyclone Amphan

The year 2020 was another active year in terms of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, with nine depressions forming in the region and five of them intensifying into cyclonic storms and more. Together, these systems caused damage worth $15.78 billion (one lakh fifty-seven thousand crore rupees), and killed about 269 people.

Advertisement Among these, Amphan—the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cyclone—was one of the strongest cyclones to hit India, while also being the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean in terms of damage caused.

On May 18, Amphan hit its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and two days later, made landfall over West Bengal. It caused great damage across coastal West Bengal, Odisha, Northeast India, and Bangladesh claiming 128 lives and causing overall destruction worth $13.7 billion (one lakh thirty-seven thousand crore rupees).

A few months later, Cyclone Nivar became the second-most destructive cyclone to hit India in 2020, as it made landfall over Tamil Nadu in late November and caused damage worth $600 million (four thousand crore rupees), killing 14. Other cyclones, namely Nisarga, Gati and Burevi, did cause significant local impacts. But, fortunately, the damages were not as high as Amphan and Nivar.

China Floods

Southern China, particularly the Yangtze basin and its tributaries, was affected by severe floods this year, as heavy rains wreaked havoc across the region during the rainy season between June-September. This disaster also extended to central and eastern China during July, effectively creating the worst flood situation the region has experienced since at least 1998. A total of 443 rivers were flooded nationwide, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded!

As per the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), a spike in rainfall activity—caused by climate change-induced rise in vapours emergence from the Indian and Pacific oceans—led to the flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like the reclamation of lakes and wetlands, urban development, and mass-disappearance of lakes also helped escalate the events.

By August, the floods had killed at least 219 people across the country, affected about 63.46 million people, and damaged 54,000 houses, 76 key national cultural relics, and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites. Overall, the disaster caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY.

The destruction in China aside, the release of water from these swollen rivers may also have contributed to the flooding that occurred in adjoining India’s northeastern state of Assam during this period.

Assam Floods

Monsoon floods are a common occurrence for northeast India. But, the year 2020’s Indian monsoon season was particularly difficult for Assam, as the state remained constantly flooded due to persistent spells of heavy rainfall and above-average seasonal precipitation in the region.

The initial flooding began with heavy showers in May, and it wasn’t until October that the statewide situation began to improve. By then, however, the floods had already affected over 50 lakh residents across 30 districts and 5,474 villages, killed 123 and forced over 1.5 lakh people to seek refuge in 627 relief camps and 1662 relief distribution centres set-up by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The floods also induced landslides, which further claimed 26 more lives.

Floods also exacerbated the spread of novel coronavirus in Assam, with the state recording over 2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in this period. Stagnant waters and lack of access to clean water, hygiene supplies are also believed to have caused a spike in dengue, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis cases.

The inundation and subsequent landslides damaged bridges, government buildings, roads, embankments, and schools while putting at least 2.67 lakh hectares of crops to ruin. The flooding also affected the wildlife within the state, with more than 45,000 domesticated animals forced to flee or be abandoned, more than 150 wild animals rescued from the Kaziranga National Park, and 125 animals in the park, including 12 rhinoceros, succumbing to the floodwaters.

Several villages in Region Nine (Upper Takatu-Upper Essequibo) were Monday flooded due to heavy rainfall and rising rivers in neighbouring Brazil, prompting authorities to obtain relief supplies, Regional Executive Officer Karl Singh said.

“Those rivers in Brazil, including the Amazon, are flowing and pushing back the water to the Takatu River. All the communities along the Takatu River will be affected. The Rupununi River is also high so that is affecting Sand Creek and those areas,” he said.

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) said the floods are being caused by “seasonal rainfall”.

He said residents and businesses in Lethem, the regional capital town, were also bracing themselves for severe flooding as the water level there has been rising steadily. “Right here in Lethem, the water is rising rapidly and a bridge that connects Lethem to St. Ignatius , water is already on the dam already,” he said.

He said mud brick houses were under severe threat because they are very vulnerable to moist conditions. “Once the soil is damp around, it also means that that the mud is going to be damp and the wall will start cracking and so on,” the Regional Executive Officer said.

Mr. Singh said relief efforts were also being coordinated with the Civil Defence Commission (CDC), the government’s emergency response agency, and preparations would be made to eventually assist farmers when the flood waters recede.

The Regional Executive Officer said among the worst hit is Baishaidrun village. That Deep South Rupununi village, which has about 35 households, is under more than two feet of water. “All their farms- all the cassava, all the eddoes, all the provisions and so on are under water so that is how severe it is,” he said. Mr. Singh said the village, located about 200 kilometres from Lethem and close to the Takatu River, has been virtually cut off by the flood waters. “Right now, I have in my possession some food supplies but I am unable to get there because of the accessibility,” he said.

Also affected are Shea Village, another Deep South Rupununi village, where 15 farms are under water.

In the South Central Rupununi village of Sand Creek, the Regional Executive Officer said water has affected houses and residents could not access their farm lands.

The Regional Executive Officer said the CDC has dispatched 300 hampers which were expected to arrive by road Monday night. He said the Region Nine administration has also purchased another 300 hampers.

Meanwhile, residents of Deep South Rupununi are urging drivers of heavy duty vehicles not to cross the Karaudar village bridge because the support has been damaged due to force of the river and erosion.

The CDC said authorities in Region 9, and all other Administrative Regions across Guyana, were being urged to be alert and activate their Regional Response Mechanisms as required and in keeping with their Regional Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan.

The CDC noted that the National Weather Watch Center indicates that “continuous rainfall is expected.” “Residents are encouraged to stockpile on potable water, food, health and hygiene supplies; avoid flood waters and inundated areas; and observe weather patterns and at-risk areas,” the agency said.",2021-05-18 00:01:42+00:00,"['south', 'water', 'cdc', 'executive', 'flooded', 'rupununi', 'regional', 'river', 'residents', 'officer', 'villages', 'village']",Brazil,news article,English
1152,FL-2020-000132-UGA,UGANDA: “WE WERE PROMISED AIR”: ELEGU TRADERS DEMAND ANSWERS AS MEGA PROJECT TO MITIGATE FLOODS STALLS - Black Star News,https://www.blackstarnews.com/global-politics/africa/uganda-%E2%80%9Cwe-were-promised-air%E2%80%9D-elegu-traders-demand-answers-as,"Elegu Township in dry season –Photo by Jesse Johnson James

Susan Afoyocan’s fear of losing her restaurant business started when she saw the first drops of rain.

It was at the onset of the rainy season last month, as the farming communities eagerly began preparing their gardens that she knew she had to do something about these warning signs. Last year, around the same time, heavy rains destroyed Afoyocan’s local eatery and washed away her fruit stall in the process.

And now the 33-year-old was determined to protect her source of livelihood as she set about renovating and remodeling her restaurant as a measure to mitigate the floods.

“I know what happens when it rains here heavily…” Afoyocan, a mother of three, said as she instructed local laborers who were busy carrying tin roofs for covering her restaurant.

“I have to act very fast now or else I will lose everything again.”

As climate changes continues to take toll on Uganda –and globally— the adverse effects of the extreme weather—characterized by erratic rains and raging floods—have triggered growing concerns from climate activists and civil society organization (CSOs) who blame the government of failing to build infrastructures and enforcing preventing policies (such as tree planting along river banks and flood plains to act as a drag on flood waters) that protect disaster–prone areas like Elegu.

The business community operating at the border town have for years continuously battled the raging floods, especially during the rainy season. River Unyama, a nearby water course which often bursts its banks, has also on many occasion not spared the low-lying border town whenever it rains heavily. In November last year, more than 700 people were displaced by floods, and eight others killed, leaving 2,000 acres of crops destroyed following heavy rains in the marshy border town.

Revenue washed away

And now local leaders are accusing the government of making ‘empty promises’ instead of addressing the problem urgently. In 2018, government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Trade and Industries for the 18 billion shillings-project meant to mitigate floods in Elegu. The project, funded by Trade Mark East Africa, was meant to widen the banks of River Unyama to improve the drainage system at Elegu Town.

But four years later, nothing has been done except for only the feasibility study that was carried out by an engineering team at the construction site.

“We were promised air and now the rains are back [again],” said Bosco Onen who works at a retail shop. “For how long shall we wait while we suffer?”

Elegu, a border town with a population of close to 12,000 people, is the biggest revenue earner for Amuru district. Operations by Amuru’s local government fail to run smoothly due to financial constraints resulting majorly from the low revenue collections from the local businesses that are affected by floods.

‘[Trade ministry officials] are not feeling the pinch of the suffering of our community members whose businesses are affected [by] floods,” said Michael Lakony, Amuru District Chairman, adding, ""[They should] come to our rescue...in making sure that we curb the disaster.”

There is also information deficit regarding the progress of the project. And at moment, the Trade Ministry officials are being accused of being cagey— when it comes to giving out information about the project— by local leaders who claim they’ve been left in the dark for most of the time.

When this reporter contacted Julius Kasirye, the Project Manager for Border Export Zone–BEZ under the Ministry of Trade and Industries for comment, said:” …the matter can only be best responded to by either the Permanent Secretary [of] the Minister of Trade and Industry.”

The Trade Ministry Permanent Secretary didn’t respond to our repeated phone calls either.

But for now, as the rainy season continues to pound on, the business community at Elegu have to remain resilient and survive on their own as they wait for government support. On a recent day, as the clouds began to open up, a group of young women rushed to collect pieces of cassava spread outside on thin plastic paper for sun drying. Nearby, a young mother was busy rebuking some of kids who were playing outside in the middle of the chaos.

""If nothing is done [to help us], we will keep suffering,"" said Afoyocan.",2021-04-26 15:50:05+00:00,"['project', 'demand', 'mitigate', 'season', 'ministry', 'town', 'border', 'stalls', 'uganda', 'promised', 'elegu', 'rains', 'mega', 'floods', 'traders', 'local', 'trade']",Uganda,news article,English
152,FF-2012-000189-IDN,"As Myanmar Opens to World, Fate of Its Forests Is on the Line - Yale Environment 360",https://e360.yale.edu/features/as_myanmar_opens_to_world_fate_of_its_forests_is_on_the_line,"Allied soldiers and locals escaping the Japanese advance through northern Burma during World War II had to contend with dense jungles, scorching heat, leeches, insects, torrential rain, and 10,000-foot peaks dividing the country — now known as Myanmar — from India. Today, large swaths of that forbidding wilderness remain intact. The country’s Northern Forest Complex, a 12,000-square-mile tract that runs along the border from India to China in Myanmar’s Kachin State, is home to tigers, bears, elephants, and hundreds of bird species. The heart of that forest, at nearly 8,500 square miles, is Myanmar’s Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, the largest tiger preserve in the world.

Now, as Myanmar cautiously embraces democracy and opens up to the world — President Obama will visit the country next week, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so — a key question is what impact an influx of outside capital and foreign expertise will have on the country’s wild lands, biodiversity, and natural resources. The sanctions imposed by Western governments in response to the military dictatorship’s brutal human rights record arguably helped to preserve Myanmar’s remote areas by denying access to credit and foreign investment that would have otherwise been used for road building in the northern jungles.

Some experts warn an influx of foreign capital into Myanmar might cause significant environmental harm.

But with Western governments now lifting sanctions to reward the government’s democratic reforms, some experts warn that an influx of foreign capital might open the floodgates to development and cause significant environmental harm. In a bid to expand regional trade routes, for instance, both the Chinese and Japanese governments are making plans to open transportation corridors through some of Myanmar’s far-flung jungles, paving the way for resource exploitation. The economic might of China, just to the north, is ever-present. In the Hukaung wildlife sanctuary, only 50 tigers are thought to survive, the rest victimized by an illegal wildlife trade with Chinese merchants who pay up to $30,000 for a single animal, dried and packed in a box.

The harsh sanctions also took a toll on Burma’s environment, pushing the country into abject poverty and driving villagers toward poaching and slash-and-burn farming practices that deplete soils and turn landscapes into wastelands. On a drive through the Taung-nyo public protected forest in Rakhine State — near the west coast and way off the beaten tourist track — I saw ragtag bamboo settlements dotting the roadside and a patchwork of charred hillsides and scrubby growth. My host, U Myint Aung, an ex-forestry official who now runs a homegrown non-governmental organization called Friends of Wildlife (FOW), said that the settlements were illegal but tolerated by forest rangers who allow villagers to remain in exchange for small bribes.

So far, Western conservationists in Myanmar are generally heartened by the strong environmental stance Myanmar’s rulers appear to be taking in advance of an expected surge in economic development. “They seem to be taking a much more measured approach to environmental planning, even without international pressure, and that’s to be applauded,” says Joe Walston, executive director of the Asia program of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).

In a well-publicized move last year, Myanmar postponed a massive China-sponsored dam that would have flooded more than 64,000 acres at the headwaters of the Irrawaddy River, citing environmental concerns. Mining along the country’s four major rivers has been banned. And during his inaugural speech in March 2011, President Thein Sein said, “We will pay serious attention to conservation of forests… and lay down a new policy in which we will work for economic development in parallel with environmental conservation.”

New money unleashed by the end of sanctions could help shore up the underfunded environmental sector.

Alan Rabinowitz, chief executive officer of Panthera, a big-cat conservancy group based in New York City, believes that new money unleashed by the elimination of sanctions could go a long way toward shoring up the country’s chronically underfunded environmental sector. In 2003, when he was working for WCS — the only foreign conservation group to maintain a consistent presence in Myanmar during the years of dictatorship — Rabinowitz spearheaded the creation of the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary.

“There’s never been enough money or expertise or people to help with the defense of Myanmar’s protected areas,” he says. “For years, the World Bank has told me that it wants to help but that it can’t because of the sanctions. So I see the opening as a huge step forward for Myanmar’s ecology.”

U Than Myint, the WCS’s country program director in Yangon, the former capital, agrees that the lifting of sanctions will benefit NGOs in Myanmar’s increasingly active civil society. WCS helps train and fund park rangers and offers training and financial support for communities to shift to sustainable agriculture. “It used to be that all of us in the civil society struggled with limited funding sources,” Than Myint says. “But now with the political opening, we’re seeing more funding agencies and organizations coming here and what we hope is that with their help we can expand our activities.”



The Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, created in northern Myanmar in 2003. WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY

NGOs and environmental officials in Myanmar’s government published a report last April detailing a rich diversity of wildlife in the country, but also many critically endangered species, including white-bellied herons, now limited to the most remote waterways in the eastern Himalaya; snub-nosed monkeys; black musk deer; pangolin; and Sumatran rhinoceros.

However, chronic data shortages make it exceedingly difficult to quantify Myanmar’s diversity and natural resources. Kevin Woods, a Yangon-based Ph.D. candidate in environmental science policy and management at the University of California, blames rebel activity in particular for the lack of scientific investigations on the borders, where some of the best-preserved ecosystems remain. “It’s not possible to do any sort of survey in Kachin State,” he says. “Apart from the war, the Northern Forest Complex is extremely remote, with almost no roads. Moreover, the government is severely understaffed, underfunded, and it’s difficult for NGOs to get into that area because of the suspicion locals have towards outsiders.”

Similarly, the full extent of Myanmar’s forest resources — including the famous golden teak that historically accounted for much of the country’s timber exports — is difficult to gauge. In a 2011 report, Woods wrote that Myanmar’s government doesn’t collect or publish data that would be necessary for a “deeper analysis and understanding of the forest industry.” The report did conclude, however, that the forest sector has become increasingly corrupt; that governance systems affecting the forest sector are poorly designed, opaque, and subject to manipulation by military regional commanders and ethnic leaders; that the actual source of exported timber is often unknown; and that the influence of Asian countries looking for a stake in Myanmar’s timber trade — including China, India, Thailand, and Bangladesh — has grown as that of the U.S. and the European Union has waned.

One report concluded that Myanmar’s forest sector has become increasingly corrupt.

The most recent estimates published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicate that Myanmar’s primary forests occupy 10 percent of the country’s land area, mostly in the northern and eastern parts of the country. That’s a substantial amount, given Myanmar’s sheer size. (It’s the second-largest Southeast Asian country, after Indonesia.) According to the FAO, primary forest covers 35 percent of Thailand. But these figures do not tell the whole story: Thailand’s primary forests are more fragmented, and outside of strictly protected areas they are not as pristine as Myanmar’s, according to Jack Hurd, the deputy managing director for the Nature Conservancy’s Asia-Pacific program. Unlike other Southeast Asian nations, Myanmar also has not experienced the widespread conversion of primary forests to monoculture plantations of rubber, palm, and eucalyptus.

Hurd says that given the lack of infrastructure, particularly roads, Myanmar has been able to avoid the industrial deforestation that has occurred elsewhere in Southeast Asia. “What you see instead is lots of ad-hoc, opportunistic exploitation and deals cut among the Myanmar Timber Enterprise [a government body], state governments, and border logging interests,” he says. “So deforestation isn’t as widespread as it could have been if Myanmar’s borders were exposed to the forces of globalization.”

Jake Brunner, the Mekong program director with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, in Hanoi, says that Myanmar’s government needs to impose emergency measures to conserve highly threatened areas, including the Irawaddy River delta’s mangrove forests, which have been decimated by villagers making charcoal. But in the long run, he says, forest protections will depend on whether the country’s emerging governance structures can align national environmental goals with local interests.

Initial signs look promising, Hurd says. But as a country so poor and isolated that less than 2 percent of its 60 million people owns a cell phone, Myanmar faces many challenges. The main risk is that a Wild West mentality will take hold as companies emboldened by trade liberalization scramble to exploit the most valuable resources.

The experience of once-communist Cambodia is a cautionary tale. After free elections in 1993, much of the country was turned over to foreign timber interests. Within 10 years, 50 percent of Cambodia’s old-growth forests were gone. “Avoiding that is going to require political will, but it’s also going to require the necessary capacity and resources,” Hurd says. “The sooner the international community can help Myanmar’s government and civil society figure out how to implement a sustainable approach to resource management, the better.”",2012-11-15 08:00:00+00:00,"['fate', 'opens', 'environmental', 'line', 'sanctions', 'conservation', 'world', 'myanmars', 'wildlife', 'countrys', 'forest', 'myanmar', 'northern', 'forests', 'country']",India,news article,English
428,Drought Sri Lanka,A new fault line in post-war Sri Lanka - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-new-fault-line-in-post-war-sri-lanka/article27028310.ece,"After 10 years of a fragile peace, the deadly bombings on April 21 have blighted the eastern lagoon landscape of the island nation, pitting religious communities against one another. Meera Srinivasan reports on the simmering tensions in the aftermath of the attacks

Every few metres in Batticaloa a white poster with the words ‘Kanneer Anjali’ (tribute with tears) appears, tied to trunks of trees, walls of churches, or gates of mosques. Right below the bold letters is an image of a pair of eyes, weeping.

Near town, the narrow lane leading to the evangelical Zion Church, where one of the bombers blew himself up, just as his fellow jihadists did at two Catholic churches in Colombo and Negombo, is cordoned off. A huge banner with mugshots and names of the victims hangs at the entrance. Many of them are studio pictures of well-dressed children smiling at the camera.

Sri Lankans are yet to fully comprehend the dreadful Easter blasts that shook the country less than a fortnight ago, killing over 250 people across churches and hotels in and around the capital Colombo, and in this eastern city some 300 km away. They are grappling with possible reasons and necessary responses with urgency, evident in the many statements and solidarity messages emerging from different religious and civil society groups.

But the people of Batticaloa have an additional burden.

Batticaloa’s burden

While Sri Lanka’s Muslims, who make up nearly 10% of the population, are scattered across the island, their highest concentration is in the Eastern Province, comprising Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara districts.

Apart from losing 28 of its residents, including 14 children who were at Sunday school on April 21, Batticaloa is also where Zahran Hashim, the alleged mastermind of the Easter attacks, hailed from. Perhaps for that reason, the district has remained in the spotlight, more often figuring in tales about a radical Islamist-turned-suicide bomber and much less in those about victims of his ghastly act.

Stories of pastor Kumaran who lost his 11-year-old son, the parents of young siblings Sharon and Sarah, and the family of Ramesh Raju, who tried intercepting the suicide bomber and died, faded within days.

Even as different narratives of the distressing episode compete for credibility, Muslims and Christians suddenly find themselves cast on either side of the atrocity as “perpetrators” and “victims”, despite many knowing that those who perished were not all Christians and despite much of the Muslim community vehemently condemning the attacks carried out by a small radical group as “barbaric”. More perplexing is the nature of the attack itself — of Muslims targeting Christians, fellow minorities, with whom they have no known animosity. In fact, in Sri Lanka’s post-war years, Muslims and, in fewer instances, Christians have faced violent attacks from hard-line Sinhala-Buddhist forces.

While scores of affected families struggle to cope with the shock and those stubborn Easter morning memories that won’t leave, the people of Batticaloa appear to be bracing for other likely repercussions, not fully known, but potentially dangerous. Their scenic coastal town with lush paddy lands around, and a calming lagoon running through, unexpectedly turned into a site of horror on Easter day.

“The Christians are shattered,” says Fr. Rajan Rohan, attached to the St. John’s church in Batticaloa, which is run by the American Ceylon Mission. Hailing from the nearby Valaichchenai town, he returned to Batticaloa last September, after completing assignments in the northern Jaffna city during the final years of the war, and later in Nuwara Eliya, in the Central Province. “When I came back here, I was shocked to see how much this place had changed.”

As a child, Fr. Rohan recalls being thrilled around Ramzan. “We loved that kanji (porridge) our neighbours made with beef stock. It was a delicacy that we eagerly awaited every year,” he says. Muslim families sharing treats with children in the neighbourhood was not uncommon, and words like “co-existence” had no use in an effortlessly multireligious society.

But in 2018, things were different in Fr. Rohan’s home town. “There was a lot of Islamophobia among our Tamil people. In a country that has paid a heavy price because of Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarianism, it was startling to see Tamils so preoccupied with Muslims,” he recalls. “They would say things like ‘we can never trust Muslims’ easily in conversation.”

Kattankudy, which is among the most densely populated areas in the island.

Sri Lanka’s Muslims are mostly Tamil-speaking, but identify as a separate ethnic group, distinct from Tamils, most of whom are Hindus and the rest Christians. The three-decade-long civil war not only saw raging hostility between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils, who bore the brunt of the carnage, but also witnessed Tamil-Muslim relations sour.

Despite being bound by language, they grew apart, with the Tamil militants seeing the Muslims as aligned to and aiding the state security forces that they were fighting. The 1990 mosque massacres in Kattankudy and nearby Eravur, in which the LTTE mowed down nearly 150 Muslims at prayer, and the LTTE’s mass expulsion of Muslims from the north later that year, have left a long shadow of bitterness and resentment.

On his return, Fr. Rohan, who leads an interfaith initiative, found it hard to bring Tamils and Muslims together. “But we were trying. And just when we had begun working on those lines, this [bombings] has happened,” he says, pointing to the “daunting” task ahead.

Strained ties

It is not just Tamil-Muslim ties that witnessed a change in the past decades. The Muslim community has seen substantial changes within, according to A.L.M. Sabeel, a member of the local Urban Council and a former secretary of the Kattankudy Mosques Federation.

Starkly different from the rest of Batticaloa, Kattankudy town stands out. Short date palm trees line the median cutting through this town for some 50 metres, with shops on either side selling garments, gadgets and other essentials. Several mosques and cultural centres can be seen along the main road, while thousands of families live in crammed houses along the streets off the main road. The township is among the most densely populated areas in the island.

“Women of my mother’s generation used to wear a saree, wrapping their heads with the pallu. But in the last 15-20 years, we see more women switching to the abaya [full gown]. The face veil is an even more recent thing,” notes Sabeel, 45, who was raised here. Among men, the full-length white robes and long beards are recent imports. “My father was clean-shaven. But many men of my generation, including myself, sport a beard,” he says, attributing the relatively newer trends to more labour migration to West Asian countries, Arab funding for local institutions and consequent interactions, and social media exposure. “I don’t think some of these ideas suit us, especially these clothes in such hot weather.”

However, changes in attire, he points out, coincided with “a more significant shift”. “We are a minority in this country and have historically embraced a Sri Lankan identity. But in recent times, many Muslims appear keen on asserting their religious identity, often in the name of culture.” The community, in his view, also turned more insular during this time.

Meanwhile, some within the community question this new, relatively more rigid idea of “Islamic culture”. Culture is about convenience, argues a 40-year-old mother of three. “I wear the abaya when I go out somewhere but prefer a salwar kameez with a headscarf when I visit my doctor. Culture is what you want to make of it. Some people might criticise you over your choices but isn’t that the case in every community?”

Accommodating different shades of opinion on the practice of Islam, Islamic culture and assertion, Sri Lankan Muslims have largely remained together as a community, with trade being a key binding factor. Although Muslims of the east were engaged in agriculture, fisheries and livelihoods such as weaving in the past, they became a predominantly trading community over the years.

“It is true that Muslims mobilise well and maintain good networks within the community. And that irritates many Tamils,” Sabeel notes.

A troubled youth

Thangavel Roshan, 28, took the Easter weekend off and travelled from Colombo, where he works at a construction site. “We usually work all seven days to accumulate our days off to travel home,” he says, seated outside his home in Navatkudah in Batticaloa. A few metres into this locality, concrete roads give way to rickety mud roads.

His right leg is bandaged and kept raised on a plastic stool. Roshan, along with his family, was at Zion Church on Easter Sunday when he saw the bomb explode right in front of his eyes. “I was lucky, I escaped with this injury,” he says. His parents and siblings too did, as they were further away. Doctors have advised Roshan three months’ rest before he can get back to work. “If there were enough jobs here, I wouldn’t be working so far away. A big chunk of my salary goes for the commute [Colombo is an eight-hour bus ride away]. I haven’t saved a rupee so far,” he says.

His older brother Thangavel Nelson works at a highway project in Kurunegala in the North Western Province. “They say post-war development and all that; I think that happened only in the north. The east hasn’t got anything... no factories, no development, no jobs. We have to struggle outside for such little money,” he sulks, blaming Tamil politicians “who don’t care.”

“But look at Muslims,” he says, voicing what appears to be a popular grievance among many Tamils. “They get government jobs, they prosper in business. Unlike us, they are very secure.”

Much of the antagonism is also linked to the ongoing struggles around resources in the district, according to Sitralega Maunaguru, retired professor at the Eastern University in Batticaloa.

“There are a lot of simmering tensions between the communities over allocation of land in many areas, and in sharing water. People of different communities accuse each other’s local politicians of manipulating and favouring their people,” she says, adding that conversations on these subjects often quickly escalate to anti-Muslim speech. “The recent bombings are bound to fan those tensions.”

Muslim politicians and their patronage networks are common talking points among Tamils. As partners in Sri Lanka’s ruling coalition, Muslim leaders hold key ministerial portfolios, while the main Tamil party is in opposition. Tamil leaders, in turn, are seen as lacking political power or the will to make a difference.

With clashing interests of the political class and the leaders’ vote bank manoeuvres shaping their realities, people, especially the youth, appear to be entangled in a web of insecurities — political, economic and social.

“Their politicians take good care of them. Muslim people can get away with anything,” says Nelson matter-of-factly.

Old prejudice, new fear

This view, which is shared by many others, is precisely what makes Fr. Rohan rather nervous. Inter-community relations, which are also ethnic relations in this context, are fragile and need to be handled with great care, he observes. “We have to sensitise our [Tamil] community, including children. Even in jest, a Tamil child should not tell a Muslim friend anything like, ‘we can’t trust you guys, you’ll drop a bomb’.”

Clearly, Fr. Rohan’s immediate concern was about preventing any backlash against the Muslims. “While we comfort the affected families, it is important to try and prevent adverse reactions. We don’t want others to use our name and attack the Muslims for what a small, isolated group did. That will lead to more hate and clashes in our society.”

His apprehension is rooted in two main reasons. One, the delicate social relations that prevail in the multi-ethnic districts of the Eastern Province, where Muslims are the single largest group, constituting 38% of the population. The province is also home to some 6 lakh Tamils (Hindus and Christians), and 3.5 lakh Sinhalese (Buddhists and Christians), making it one of Sri Lanka’s most diverse regions. Two, the spate of anti-Muslim violence in varying intensities, and led by hard-line Sinhala-Buddhist groups in the last seven years, has made Muslims more vulnerable.

Further, he emphasises that Tamil society cannot afford another cycle of violence and distress. “If our youth resort to militancy again, some of us will turn targets very soon. We saw that happen with the LTTE, where the organisation we nurtured turned against us when we voiced disagreement or dissent.”

The government too has a role in preventing any retaliation, he notes. “They were quick to ban the radical Islamist organisations behind the attacks as ‘terrorist’ outfits. They ought to show the same promptness when it comes to radical Sinhala-Buddhist organisations notorious for inciting violence.”

In the current Sri Lankan context, his fears of a backlash are well-founded — where post-war reconciliation has dragged, a political solution to the Tamil question remains out of sight, and youth across ethnicities are disgruntled amid growing joblessness. Especially so in the wake of Sri Lankan authorities naming the little-known local radical Islamist group, the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ), and its allies as perpetrators of the Easter attacks, which the Islamic State has also claimed.

Whether it is the NTJ’s links abroad, or the rationale for their targets (churches and hotels) or the extent of radicalisation within the Muslim community, questions outnumber answers at this point. But those feeling uneasy about the likely impact of the attacks say there is no time to waste.

The peril of radicalisation

With the government claiming that Hashim was among the nine suicide bombers who carried out the coordinated bombings, some may believe the problem is over, but it is hardly so, according to M.B.M. Firthous, a Kattankudy-based preacher, who also heads a local school. “The conciliatory statements that different religious leaders made after the attacks talk about peace and co-existence, but those are things that have to be said. The problem, unfortunately, runs deeper,” he says. The sooner it is acknowledged, the greater the chances of addressing it, he notes.

After every incident of an anti-Muslim attack in recent years, “some forces” within the Muslim community tried to radicalise youth through classes and videos, urging them to retaliate. But the community had no appetite for it and rejected it outright, according to different mosque leaders in the province.

“A few youth were perhaps ideologically drawn to a more rigid interpretation and practice of Islam, at times due to social media influences. Others, who were deeply affected by the anti-Muslim attacks, found the radical path speaking to their outrage. But they were very, very few and didn’t have any support from the community,” says Sabeel.

But radicalisation is not about numbers, Firthous cautions. “If the idea has been sown in even one person’s mind, we have to be very worried,” he says, pointing to an “urgent need” for introspection within the Muslim community. “We cannot afford to isolate ourselves. There is a lot to be done by all communities.” He also blames the many peace-building efforts that followed the civil war: “They were run by NGOs and well-funded by donors, but they merely scratched the surface without any meaningful effort or reflection on the part of communities.”

And today, the outrage over the disparities and injustices accumulated over years of war and peace is manifesting in new, grievous ways. About a week after the victims of the blast were laid to rest in Batticaloa, and amid several interfaith meetings and messages of assurance, a group of young men went around parts of Batticaloa on motorbikes, distributing flyers asking Tamils to boycott Muslim-owned shops and to quit working there. “We, the youth, must be aware and prevent terrorists who, in the garb of traders, enter our towns,” says the provocative leaflet attributed to ‘Tamil youth, Eastern Province’.

According to a resident who received it on Wednesday night, a trishaw (three-wheeler) followed the motorbikes, with someone inside speaking through a loudspeaker. They were “clearly stoking hatred”, says the resident, who asked not to be named. “We don’t know who got the youth to distribute the flyers. It could be anyone seeking political mileage from this tragic moment. But sadly, they might get it. Even at the cost of more violence and bloodshed, perhaps.”",2019-05-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['line', 'tamil', 'muslim', 'youth', 'postwar', 'christians', 'lanka', 'sri', 'muslims', 'batticaloa', 'fault', 'community', 'different', 'tamils']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
829,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Canada 'much closer' to national flood program: IBC - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/canada-much-closer-to-national-flood-program-ibc-1004161513/,"The industry is making progress on getting a national flood insurance program, but a key challenge is getting all provinces, territories and Ottawa to agree on how it should work, the Insurance Bureau of Canada’s CEO suggested Tuesday.

Unlike Britain and the United States (which have Flood Re and that National Flood Insurance Program respectively), Canada does not have a national backstop for overland flood insurance.

“In Canada, with the federal government, 10 provinces and three territories – we have to get them all to somehow agree to a national program, which has not been an easy task. We are much closer to that today than we were, say, five years ago,” IBC CEO Don Forgeron told a room full of industry professionals at Swiss Re’s Canadian Annual Outlook Breakfast.

He was asked by Canadian Underwriter whether Flood Re – which the British government rolled out in 2016 – is a good model for Canada to follow.

“For many years I have been saying we are the only G7 country without a flood program, but the other six didn’t work,” Forgeron said at the breakfast, held at One King West in Toronto’s financial district. “I am going to change that now because the British one is probably the closest to a functional model we have been able to find.”

He did not go so far as to recommend that Canada put something similar in place.

With Flood Re, the British government is trying to have the vast majority of properties at low flood risk subsidize a small minority of properties at high risk. Every home insurer in the U.K. must pay a levy towards flood Re. On top of that, when a primary insurer covers flood for a given home, Flood Re then charges that primary insurer a premium tied to the home’s council tax band, which in essence is a tool used in Britain to put a value on the property for tax purposes.

“We have been over to the U.K. to look at Flood Re model and the federal government has also been over to look at it,” Forgeron said Tuesday during the Swiss Re breakfast. “In all the jurisdictions we have looked at, where they fail is with the high risk properties. That’s where the vast majority of their losses come from, and the question becomes, how do you price that? If it’s not full risk-based pricing, who pays it? And how is it paid? That’s usually where these programs fall down and that’s what the federal government has asked us to take a look at in terms of some sort of high-risk pool.”

For its part, the United States brought in the controversial National Flood Insurance Program in 1968. In order to qualify for flood insurance under NFIP, the property must be in a community that has joined the NFIP and agrees to enforce sound floodplain management standards.

NFIP owed the federal treasury US$30 billion by 2017, at which point $16 billion was forgiven. But NFIP borrowed billions more to cover losses from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico respectively in late 2017.

Some critics say properties insured by NFIP should pay a premium that more closely reflects actual risk. A law intended to do exactly that was passed in 2012 but later repealed after politicians complained some constituents saw huge increases in their home insurance rates.

In Canada, managing flood risk is more important with the increasing frequency of severe weather events, Forgeron said Tuesday.“These events are no longer affecting only areas that have traditionally been exposed to risk. Twenty per cent of Canadian households some vulnerability to floods and that figure is increasing.”

IBC urges governments to spend more on educating consumers about their risk of water damage and to improve land use planning.

“Too many communities are still making bad decisions and everyone acts shocked when their low-lying subdivision wakes up to three feet of water.”",2019-04-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['federal', 'properties', 'program', 'forgeron', 'closer', 'risk', 'ibc', 'nfip', 'national', 'canada', 'flood', 'insurance']",Canada,news article,English

Footage depicts a bull being sledgehammered to death in Vietnam. Credit:Animals Australia Instead of suspending the trade, the Australian government expedited the approval of dozens of facilities in Vietnam, and approved exports that effectively flooded the market with Australian animals. Even though the department was aware of endemic regulatory breaches, Vietnam was permitted to become Australia's second largest export market for live cows for slaughter, with more than half a million Australian animals exported over the past two years alone. The country now has almost 200 approved facilities, with more abattoirs than exist in Australia. A bull appearing to be wearing an Australian tag in footage filmed undercover in Vietnam. Credit:Animals Australia

The rate of market expansion into Vietnam has made it virtually impossible for industry and government to monitor compliance with Australian standards, opposition agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon says. Blindly pursuing new export opportunities in countries without animal-welfare laws or slaughter standards is undoubtedly a contributing factor, but the problem is far more systemic, far more ingrained, in the live export regulatory system as a whole. After footage of the shocking abuse of cattle in Indonesia was broadcast on the ABC's Four Corners in 2011, the live export trade to that country was suspended and the Gillard government introduced the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) as a means of protecting animals along the supply chain. The system continues to be touted as ""the world's best animal welfare system"" by both major parties. ESCAS purports to hold exporters accountable and to trace Australian animals, from Australian paddock to overseas slaughterhouses, to ensure minimum standards are met. Importantly, the system also aims to resolve jurisdictional barriers that prevent the Australian government from imposing and enforcing Australian animal welfare standards on importing sovereign states.

As indicated by repeated investigations, ESCAS has proved a monumental failure. Since its inception, there have been more than 100 regulatory breaches of ESCAS by Australian exporters, many of which resulting in abhorrent cruelty to Australian animals in importing countries. From a legal perspective, it's not difficult to see why the system has failed. ESCAS imposes obligations on exporters, even though the exporters have little direct control over animals once they leave Australian shores. It imposes minimum standards on importing countries, even though these standards are unenforceable and set a low threshold for welfare, such as permitting animals to be slaughtered without pre-stunning. And importantly, it's impossible to regulate away significant welfare issues inherent in the trade, such as the stress of prolonged transportation. Critically, laws are only effective if there is a willingness and ability to enforce them. Responsibility for enforcing live export regulations rests with the Department of Agriculture. In a clear conflict of interest, the department is also responsible for promoting and facilitating the industry. It is little wonder that the department has failed to sanction a single exporter for breaching the system - whether by means of a fine and/or revocation or suspension of an export licence. The system doesn't work.

Sadly, after years of shocking live export investigations - of animals having their tendons slashed in Egypt, subject to traditional rope slaughter in Indonesia, or mutilated in the streets of Jordan - this is no longer news to the Australian public. We're now accustomed to activist footage of live export cruelty. And with every new investigation, the same industry and government lines are repeated as if for the first time: that these are isolated incidents; that Australia is better able to lift global welfare standards by continuing with the trade; that we must have faith in the system. But we know that these are not isolated incidents. We know that welfare standards cannot possibly be improved when exporters are flagrantly breaching regulations with impunity. And we know better than to have faith in a system that serves only to legitimise a trade that is indefensible. Politicians from both major parties must take action. It's time to bring an end to this trade, or at the very least, suspend exports to Vietnam pending a thorough and independent investigation of these systemic failings. Until such time as the trade is brought to an end, responsibility for enforcing the industry must be taken away from the Department of Agriculture, and reinvested in a truly independent office of animal welfare.",2016-06-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['department', 'agriculture', 'conflict', 'export', 'vietnam', 'welfare', 'australian', 'cattle', 'interest', 'animals', 'shows', 'system', 'live', 'departments', 'trade', 'standards', 'horror']",India,news article,English

The flooding comes despite Ethiopia starting to fill the reservoir behind a giant new dam upstream on the Blue Nile in July. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is expected to help Sudan control future floods.

Flooding regularly hits Sudan in summer, but this year’s unprecedented water levels have left larger tracts of farmland submerged and residents around Khartoum are looking anxiously outside their homes for fear of the rising waters.

Flood waters have spilled over into major roads in Khartoum for the first time in living memory.

“The waters of the Nile flooded our house at midnight yesterday,” said Ahmed Bastawy, a resident of Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, who stayed up all night trying to protect his house only to see some of its mud brick walls collapse.

“We have never seen flooding like this. Authorities provided us with soil and sacks, but we failed to block the waters and the houses were destroyed.”

>> Renaissance dam : a regional controversy between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt

The average level of the Blue Nile has reached 17.43 metres, the highest since the country started measuring in 1912, Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas said on Thursday.

Blue Nile waters would continue to rise in the coming days, said Abdelrahman Sughairun, head of the ministry’s flood committee.

As of Tuesday the floods had left 86 people dead, destroyed more than 18,000 homes and damaged a further 32,000, according to the interior ministry.

The reservoir behind the GERD is expected to be gradually filled over the next few years as the dam begins to operate, though Ethiopia is yet to agree on its operating terms with downstream countries Sudan and Egypt.

“After the filling of the Renaissance Dam it’s expected that floods won’t happen,” Abbas said.

Description of the disaster

October â?? November â?? December 2020 Rains Season

Heavy rains were experienced in many parts of the country following onset of the October-November-December (O-N-D) 2019. The enhanced OND 2019 rains resulted into widespread flooding affecting 29 counties in Kenya: Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River and Taita Taveta of the Coastal region, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera of North Eastern Kenya and Marsabit, Isiolo and Samburu of the Upper Eastern part of the country. Other counties include Meru, Kirinyaga and Murangâ??a of the Mount Kenya area while Eastern part counties had Kitui, Kajiado, Machakos and Makueni being affected. The flooding did not spare Turkana, West Pokot, Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Narok, Kakamega, Bungoma, Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay either and response operations were sustained in all the counties mentioned by the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) response operation. The heaviest dayâ??s rainfall amount received was for 22 November 2019 which had the greatest flooding impact in the country with areas hardly hit being Northern parts, Western, Central and Coastal regions.

A total of 41,417HHs (233,339 people) were affected during the October, November, December 2019 rains season which continued into January and February 2020. In addition, 11,135HHs were displaced, 26,636 livestock deaths and 5051.5 acres of farmland destroyed. A total of 25 fatalities were recorded with KRCS as a result of the O-N-D rains.

March â?? April â?? May 2020 Rains Season

Following onset of the March â?? April â?? May 2020 rains season in March 2020, most parts of the country received more rainfall as indicated in green bars in Figure 1, which is compared with the rainfall amounts normally received as per the Long-Term Mam (LTM) as indicated in the orange bars. As observed in the figure most parts of the county received rains in the first week with a significant spike in rainfall amounts experienced from the third and fourth weeks of March 2020. In parts of Western Kenya as it were in many other parts in Kenya, rainfall continued from the O-N-D 2019 season with a short break in February and then getting into the pick of M-A-M in March 2020.

Further, April 2020 was also marked with increased rainfall amounts starting from the third week with heavy rainfall reported over most parts of the country in the week of 19th to 25th April (Figure 2). This resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in Central, South Eastern, Western and Northeastern regions where over 150mm (Figure 2, purple shaded areas) of rainfall were recorded.

The worst incident occurred on 18 April 2020, when heavy rains resulted in landslides in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, leaving 19 people dead, several missing persons and extensive damage to shelter, infrastructure and livelihoods assets.

As of 17th June 2020, KRCS had registered at least 42,064 HHs (252,384 people) displaced in 35 counties in Kenya. The society also identified 79 camps country wide where the displaced persons are staying with majority of them being in Nyanza and Western Kenya â?? Kisumu, Busia, Homabay and Migori â?? (51 camps) and Coast â?? mainly Tana River county with 20 camps.

During the M-A-M rains, at least 94 loss of lives were recorded by KRCS. In addition to the widespread impact on lives lost and destruction of critical livelihood support assets and shelter, communication, and transportation between Kitale â?? Lodwar was significantly impacted negatively with the washing away of the Murun Bridge and dozens of community members and commuters were cut off from the rest of the world.

Similarly, Garissa and Tana River Counties were affected in many parts as well following the bursting of banks of River Tana. This resulted into 15 people being marooned at Hadama location in Tana North Sub-county and KRCS response team registered 624 Households (HHs) cases of displacements and supported them with relief supplies.

The season also resulted in increased inflows which resulted in critical rise in water levels in Turkwel Dam which achieved the highest levels since the dam was constructed in early 1990s. At the peak of the surge in water levels in November 2020, water levels rose to 1,148.38 meters above sea level, leaving only 1.64 meters to spillage. The IFRC launched a Preparedness DREF to support KRCS roll out preparedness actions ahead of possible spillage. The operation ended when the trigger wasnâ??t achieved due to a reduction in rainfall amounts as a result of the cessation of the O-N-D 2020 rains in Kenya.

A surge in lake water levels in many rift valley lakes in Kenya, as well as in Lake Victoria, has also resulted in displacement of families along the shores of the lakes. Displaced families continue to camp in informal settlements on the shores of the lakes as their farms and homes have been marooned by rising water levels.

New Delhi: Locust swarms that wreaked havoc in farmland and cities like Rewari, Jhajjar and Gurugram in Haryana over the weekend have entered areas of Uttar Pradesh, the leading sugar producing state in the country.

The swarms, spread across 3-5 sq km, had ravaged crops near Gurugram on Saturday but had spared Delhi.

They have been hitting various districts of western UP and the Bundelkhand region in the last 48 hours, prompting alerts in several districts such as Agra, Kasganj, Azamgarh, Chitrakoot and Jhansi.

Authorities fear a serious threat to crops in these regions as the Kharif sowing is in full swing due to favourable monsoon rainfall.

“Due to wind direction from west to South-east direction, the locust swarms crossed over to UP and MP from Haryana instead of entering Delhi,” K.L. Gurjar, deputy director at Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), told ThePrint.

“This locust swarm from Haryana has split into 3-4 smaller swarms with one batch of locusts moving to Agra and Kasganj while a big flock is expected to move towards other parts of western UP like Chhota Agra, Badaun and Etah threatening crops in these major sugarcane producing districts in UP.

“Multiple sightings of smaller swarms have also been reported in Bundelkhand area, which borders Madhya Pradesh,” Gurjar added. “The swarms are being controlled by pesticide spray through vehicle-mounted sprayers, fire extinguisher vehicles and drones before they spill over to other nearby states threatening soybean and cotton crops.”

Crops under threat

Farmers in western UP and parts of Bundelkhand, where the swarms are headed, mainly grow sugarcane, rice, pulses, cotton and soybean during the monsoon season between June and September.

If not contained, the locust attack particularly may impact sugarcane crop in Uttar Pradesh, which constitutes 45 per cent of the sugarcane sowing area of India.

In 2019-20, sugarcane crop was grown in over 26.79 lakh hectares of land; the state’s sugarcane industry is estimated to be worth about Rs 40,000 crore. It is also the main source of income for almost 35 lakh farming families and is the backbone of various other industries such as alcohol, sanitiser, ethanol, rectified spirit and other value-added chemical industries.

A Union agriculture ministry official who did not want to be named told ThePrint, “The locust swarms, if not contained on time, can diversify into other areas in smaller groups, making it difficult to tackle them with limited resources. The current swarm is in different zones of UP and other bordering states and is likely to last for at least 14-20 days depending on measures taken.

“This year, at least 4.8 lakh hectares of farmland has been ravaged by the locust swarms. The latest swarms, if not controlled, can lead to a loss in hundreds of crores by not only destroying and delaying Kharif crop but also major horticulture produce such as fruits and vegetables in Northern India,” he added.

The official said several more such severe locust invasions are likely to happen in July as there are reports of heavy breeding across the Horn of Africa and the Iran-Pakistan border.

Resources in favour of Rajasthan, Punjab & Gujarat

While the country has been witnessing waves of locust invasions since April, a major part of the resources to combat the swarms have been deployed in the border states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat from where the invasions have occurred so far.

This, however, has left the majority of inland agrarian states to fend for themselves. Teams from Rajasthan have now been moved to Haryana and UP to help in the locust control operations.

The state governments of Haryana and UP have resorted to deploying tractor mounted sprayers and fire tender vehicles for locust control in farmlands.

“Spraying of pesticides is being done by vehicle-mounted sprayers and vehicles of the fire department,” a UP agriculture department official told ThePrint.

“Farmers have also been asked to make loud noises by beating ‘thali’ and other utensils in case it is time for authorities to reach them because if they allow the swarms to settle down over the farms then all the crops will be wiped out.

“Meanwhile ground control has been dispatched from Nagaur and Jaipur in Rajasthan to join the operations in UP along with drones from Jaisalmer,” the official added. “Until then, sirens of the police vehicle and smoke will also be used to chase the locusts.”

About 76cm (30in) of rain have fallen in Karachi since Sunday, when monsoon rains began lashing the city, forcing authorities to use boats to evacuate people trapped in flooded streets.

Twenty people were killed in Karachi in rain-related incidents and 16 others died in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after flash flooding overnight, according to government officials.

Fallen power lines caused widespread electrical outages, adding misery to the lives of many of the citys 15 million residents. Some workers stayed at their offices while others spent the night in open areas because there was no public transport to get home in many parts of the city.

Hundreds of vehicles were dragged along the streets by powerful flood waters.

At least eight people were killed when a wall fell on them in a residential area. The victims included children who were playing at the time. Other casualties were also reported in various parts of Karachi in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll from rain-related incidents to more than 40 in recent weeks.

At least 136 people have died in Pakistan since June in rain-related incidents and many residents are angry with the authorities for not doing enough to help.

Monsoon rains are pounding Pakistan at a time when the authorities are trying to contain the spread of coronovirus, which has caused more than 6,283 deaths since February, when the country reported its first case. Pakistan reported nine more deaths on Friday from Covid-19.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning.

1111,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Sydney flood death: another man rescued day before in same place - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/25/sydney-flood-death-another-man-rescued-day-before-in-same-place,"Another driver was rescued from flood waters near Cattai Creek in Sydneys north-west, a day before a 25-year-old man died when he became trapped in his car at the same location.

A local resident, who did not want to be named to protect his privacy, told the Guardian that he had pulled a young driver from the same location on Tuesday.

He had been moving his farming equipment on Tuesday morning when his father told him that someone appeared to be stuck in flood waters near their property on Cattai Ridge Road, close to Cattai Creek.

When they went to check it out, they saw a young man trapped inside his car with approximately 300ml of air space left.

The car interior was almost full with water.

The man used his bobcat to tow the car out of the water with the young man visibly shaken.

When police arrived, the resident said officers told him that the p-plate driver had been on the phone with them for at least 45 minutes.

The 25-year-old Pakistani national who died at the location on Wednesday morning had been on the phone with emergency services for more than 40 minutes before contact was lost.

NSW police Det Insp Chris Laird suggested his hire cars electrical system may have failed, preventing him from escaping.

The triple zero operator did continue to maintain contact with the 25-year-old male as he was in the car. However, at 7.04am, its believed contact was lost with the male. Police arrived on the scene shortly after and were unable to find the car.

Police said the man was driving a new car  a Toyota Camry  and it was unclear why he could not escape in time.

Laird said the flood gate blocking the road and signage was 10 metres underwater when they found his body.

The actual gate blocking the road was underwater by 10 metres, Det Insp Chris Laird said at a press conference on Wednesday.

Given the unprecedented water levels, the gates could not be seen from the roadway at all. What has happened is a complete tragedy.

The local resident questioned why the road had not been closed or proper signage installed to prevent other drivers making the same mistake.

This tragedy could have been avoided had the roads been properly closed or manned. In addition, existing flood gates should be positioned above the one-in-100-year flood line.

He also said that the very shape of the road, which dips into a valley and has many sudden turns, made it extremely dangerous during floods.

Part of the problem was that the flood gate that closes the road was submerged under the flood waters and, upon approaching the sharp bend, there was no way for a driver to realise there was water across the road, especially in the dark early hours of the morning.

He said that there was a barricade installed before the bend, but that when the man died there on Wednesday, the lights were not working.

There was a part barricade 1km beforehand, but the lights were not working. The flashing lights have since been installed on Wednesday and are now working correctly.

Police have not provided a response after being reached for comment.

Emergency services across Australia have been urging people never to drive through flood water, after another man was found dead in flood waters in the Gold Coast hinterland.

The NSW State Emergency Service has received more than 11,000 calls for assistance during the floods, including 976 rescues.

It rescued a total of 62 people on Wednesday and a total of 994 since the weather event began. More than 1,600 rescue teams have been activated across the state and more than 1,500 volunteers are currently in the field.",2021-03-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['resident', 'place', 'driver', 'sydney', 'car', 'water', 'road', 'young', 'waters', 'flood', 'rescued', 'told', 'man', 'death', 'day']",Pakistan,news article,English

The almost 1,000-year-old mela is historically used by farmers and breeders to display and trade pure Kangayam cattle.

The event coincides with the annual temple car festival of the 11th century Vikramacholeesvara temple and the three-century-old Arulmigu Mariamman temple near Kangayam.

K.S.M. Karthikeya, managing trustee of Senaapathy Kangayam Cattle Research Foundation, which is involved in ‘in-situ conservation and breeding’ of genetically pure Kangayam cattle breed for almost six decades, told The Hindu that it was indeed heart-warming that around 60 per cent of the cattle brought by the farmers/breeders to the mela found buyers even in the midst of drought-dominated farming season and got attractive prices.

This year, a single Kangayam bull fetched Rs. 1.18 lakh while a pair of oxen was sold for Rs. 1.63 lakh, he said.

“It has been noticed that most of the buyers are farmers from other region who try hard to promote organic methods of cultivation. Apart from the capability to pull heavy loads, the Kangayam cattle produce urine and dung which are proven alternatives to nitrogenous fertilizers and hence, been preferred,” Mr. Karthikeya said.

The foundation had put up an exhibition ‘Wealth of Yoke’ (extracted from Tamil for ‘Meli sinnam kolai padadhu’) to disseminate the techniques for conserving native species of cattle in the country like Kangayam cattle, Vechur cow, and Bargur cattle, and their grazing areas.",2013-04-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['bull', 'rs', 'kangayam', 'mela', 'cattle', 'lakh', 'genetically', 'karthikeya', 'temple', 'pure', 'fetches', '118', 'oxen']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Anambra is among the states hard hit by the disaster, Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency said.

Residents in flooded areas have been asked to evacuate their homes to avoid being trapped as water levels continue to rise, the agency said.

Around 176,000 people have been displaced following weeks of heavy rainfall in several states in Nigeria, the agency said.

About 20,000 people were also driven out of their homes in the south and western parts of the country, the Disaster Management Centre said.

""The Southwest monsoon began with very intense rain,"" deputy minister for Disaster Management Dunesh Gankanda told reporters in Colombo.

""There are some areas where we are unable to reach, but relief operations are under way.""

The DMC said the toll rose to 91 dead and another 110 missing as reports came in from areas which had been inaccessible earlier in the day.

Sri Lanka appealed to the international community including the United Nations and neighbouring countries for help as the numbers of dead and missing climbed.

Heavy rains in the southern and western parts of the country have destroyed hundreds of homes and cut off several roads.

""The (foreign) ministry will continue to monitor the flood situation and seek assistance as required in consultation with the Ministry of Disaster Management,"" the government said in a statement.

Sri Lanka is appealing to the international community and neighbouring countries for help

It said Colombo had already sounded out the UN and its South Asian neighbours.

The latest flooding was the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful southwest monsoon, officials said.

Today, the military deployed thousands of troops to reach marooned villagers and the airforce carried out several rescue operations to pluck people from rooftops of flooded homes.

In the early hours of the day a mountainside collapsed on a women's hostel at a tea plantation at Neluwa in the island's south, killing at least seven women, police said.

Evacuation notices were issued to residents along the Kelani river, which flows to the Indian Ocean through the capital Colombo, amid fears that it was about to burst its banks.

""The residents who are living along the Kelani should evacuate to high ground within six hours,"" the DMC said.

DMC officials said the monsoon had been expected last night and ended a prolonged drought that had threatened agriculture as well as hydro power generation.

The rains filled the reservoirs used for hydro power, which had hit rock bottom, raising concerns of power shortage in June.

But officials said most reservoirs were now so full they were in danger of spilling over and causing dangers of flooding to people living downstream.",2017-05-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['missing', 'landslides', 'homes', '91', 'flooding', 'monsoon', 'lanka', 'sri', 'kill', 'south', 'officials', 'power', 'floods', 'management', 'parts']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
831,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Canada's best province for flood risk management - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/catastrophes/canadas-best-province-flood-risk-management-1004133390/,"Five years after Albertans lost billions as a result of record floods, Ontario leads the nation when it comes to keeping properties out of high-risk areas, a catastrophe loss expert contends.

“Ontario has been most aggressive at trying to make sure that there is no new construction in a flood zone,” Paul Kovacs, founder and executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), said Tuesday in an interview.

Five years ago Tuesday, flooding started in southern Alberta, inundating downtown Calgary. The flooding caused total economic losses of about $6 billion and insured losses of nearly $2 billion, Insurance Bureau of Canada reported.

Alberta is in “better shape” than it was five years ago when it comes to managing flood risk, said Kovacs, who is also president and CEO of Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation (PACICC).

In Canada, property flood risk is partly attributable to lax zoning regulations that allow development on low ground where floods are inevitable.

“There is quite a number of houses and developments in Canada that are on floodplains,” Robert Harrison, chairman of the Insurance Brokers Association of Canada, told Canadian Underwriter earlier.

“Ontario has been a leader in terms of stopping new development [in flood zones] for more than 60 years now,” Kovacs noted Tuesday, suggesting part of this was due to Hurricane Hazel. That storm caused heavy flooding in the fall of 1954, especially on floodplains of the Humber River in the Toronto area.

Hurricane Hazel killed 81 people and caused damage of more than $180 million, wrote Zainab Moghal and Shawna Peddle in a paper, At the Front Lines of Flood: How Prepared are Ontario Communities?, published by the University of Waterloo.

The City of Mississauga “routinely refuses“ applications for development in floodplains, Mississauga city planner Michael Hynes told the Ontario Municipal Board in 3085 Queen Frederica Inc. v Mississauga (City), a ruling released Mar. 8, 2018.

That ruling was over a settlement between a developer and the city arising from an application to convert an existing 11-storey apartment building into a condominium. The development, first developed in 1969, is along Little Etobicoke Creek, about eight kilometres south of Toronto International Airport.

Every property on Queen Frederica Drive was flooded after a rainstorm hit the western Greater Toronto Area in July 8, 2013 , witnesses told an OMB hearing in February. The storm caused Canada’s fourth most expensive insured catastrophe, with industry-wide losses reaching nearly $ 1 billion.

The OMB approved the settlement agreed to by 3085 Queen Frederica Inc., the City of Mississauga and the Toronto Region Conservation Authority. As part of the settlement, the developer agreed to dozens of conditions – including “installation of measures to protect openings in the building from flooding and to ensure that owners of condominium units are provided with a flooding manual, engage in evacuation drills and receive annual updates relating to flooding matters,” OMB member Justin Duncan wrote in the ruling.",2018-06-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['told', 'canadas', 'caused', 'province', 'mississauga', 'risk', 'best', 'canada', 'settlement', 'management', 'flood', 'city', 'toronto', 'development', 'flooding']",Canada,news article,English

Heavy rainfall and damaging winds are expected to hit Victoria on Tuesday as a nightmare weather system wreaking havoc in NSW dips further south.

A severe weather and flood warning has been issued by the weather bureau for parts of eastern and southern Victoria.

“A deepening low pressure system will move southeast across NSW (on Tuesday), reaching the southern NSW coast late tonight then becoming slow moving over eastern Bass Strait on Wednesday,” the bureau said.

“Peak gusts to 110km/h are possible about the southern Gippsland coast.”

Locations likely to be affected include Wonthaggi, Mallacoota, Cann River, Chandlers Creek, Combienbar and Bonang.

The bureau said heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding during Tuesday afternoon and evening.

Senior meteorologist Richard Russell said the system would bring increasing rainfall across east Gippsland before spreading into southern Gippsland, particularly the Strzelecki Ranges, and the Otway Ranges.

“(On Tuesday) we‘re looking at this low pressure system rapidly intensifying across NSW and it will track quite quickly towards the south coast of NSW by late Tuesday afternoon and early evening,” he said.

“It will intensify further and then move over the East Gippsland coastal waters where it sit for most of Wednesday before finally moving away.”

He said from midday Tuesday through to Wednesday night, localised rainfall totals of 80-120mm were possible east of Orbost, with 150-200mm possible about the Strzelecki Ranges and Wilsons Promontory, and 100-150mm possible about the Otway Ranges.

“The heavy rainfall that we’re looking at could also lead to some localised flooding, so that’s rapid water rises not just involving rivers but gullies, creeks and areas that don’t generally get a flood warning associated with it,” Mr Russell said.

“We have some quite significant winds around that low pressure system that will intensify late (on Tuesday) with some potential for some damaging wind gusts across much of the Gippsland coast.”

He said Melbourne had “missed the worst of it” with just patchy showers through until Wednesday afternoon.

“If that low centre does unfortunately move west of the Prom, the impacts will be much higher in Melbourne, but having said that the expectation for rainfall in Melbourne is around 5-15mm,” he said.

Mr Russell reassured Victorians the impact in the state wouldn’t be anywhere near that of NSW and Queensland.

“The quite humid tropical air mass feeding across eastern Australia is more intense and feeding onto the NSW and Queensland ranges so the orientation of the Great Divide plays a big role,” he said.

“Also the position of the high pressure system for much of the week over the southern Tasman Sea has kept most of that activity further north from us.”

A flood watch has been issued for the Bemm, Cann, Genoa and Snowy River catchments, with a minor flood warning current for the Snowy River.

The State Emergency Service warned residents in affected areas to avoid dangerous hazards, such as floodwater, mud, debris, damaged roads and fallen trees and to stay inside away from windows if possible.

1000,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Strong relations likely to keep Thailand from toughening stance on Myanmar coup - The Japan Times,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/04/03/asia-pacific/thailand-myanmar-coup/,"Thailand has slightly hardened its language on Myanmar by saying it is “gravely concerned” about escalating bloodshed since a Feb. 1 coup, but close military ties and fears of a flood of refugees mean it is unlikely to go further, analysts say.

That leaves Thailand out of step with some countries of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as they seek to ramp up pressure on the junta, but could also position it as a possible mediator.

“(Thailand’s position) is difficult, but I think there is an opportunity because we’ve become an important partner,” said Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University.

The closeness of the Thai and Myanmar armies was underscored by a request from Myanmar’s junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, to Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha to “support democracy” within days of ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Prayut, who voiced that support, had himself seized power in a 2014 coup when army chief, before taking on his current civilian role in 2019, rejecting opposition accusations that the vote was manipulated.

The personal relationship began much earlier and from within armies that appear to have long put behind them the historic rivalry between countries that used to be known as Burma and Siam.

In 2018, Min Aung Hlaing was awarded Thailand’s King Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant “in honour of the support he has shown for the Thai military,” the Bangkok Post said at the time.

Brotherhood

“For them, the military brotherhood is very, very important,” said Lalita Hingkanonta, a history professor at Thailand’s Kasetsart University.

“I don’t think that the escalation of violence will change the decision of the Thai government to accept more refugees. … I think they just want to be friends with Myanmar more.”

Thailand potentially has more at stake in Myanmar than any other member of ASEAN, as it shares a 2,400 kilometer border that is also Myanmar’s longest with any neighbor.

The geographical position and a tradition of cautious diplomacy have been reasons for its particular care in remarks on the coup — only toughening its wording slightly after the civilian death toll topped 500 in Myanmar’s crackdown on anti-coup protesters.

Thailand’s wording has still been much milder than that of ASEAN democracies Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

The border risks were highlighted by a surge of several thousand refugees this week fleeing bombing by Myanmar’s forces of ethnic Karen rebels, an exodus reminiscent of the tens of thousands who fled Myanmar’s wars in previous decades.

Although Thailand denied that the latest refugees were being pushed back, they complained of having been blocked by Thai border guards, while a local Thai official told a meeting that it was official policy to bar their entry.

Gestures

While Thailand might come under diplomatic pressure to accept refugees or take a tougher stance, Lalita said Prayut’s government was unlikely to be moved.

“They would do something to respond to the international pressure, they would do some small things, just to show that, hey, we are responding very well to your concern. But that’s it.”

Business links are also strong.

Foreign direct investment by Thai businesses ranks behind only China and Singapore, with more than $11 billion approved since 1988.

Annual cross-border trade stood at more than $9 billion in 2019 and many Thai businesses rely on Myanmar migrant workers — who officially number 1.6 million.

Thailand matters even more for Myanmar, accounting for nearly a quarter of exports in 2019, mostly natural gas.

But Thailand was unlikely to use its potential economic leverage with any sanctions on trade, said Piti Srisangnam, of the ASEAN Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University.

He suggested Thailand might best pursue diplomacy behind the scenes, to try to encourage Myanmar’s generals to curb violence and launch talks with ousted civilians now locked up or branded as traitors.

“If you have one friend you’ve known for a very long time, and one day he commits murder, it doesn’t mean you won’t be friends with him, right?” he said.

A major rescue operation is on in the area by various government agencies including the ITBP and the army, they said. The loss of lives and property are yet to be ascertained fully.

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat left for the spot to monitor the situation. Two dams including the under-construction Rishiganga and another named Dhauliganga have been damaged in the disaster.

""In the primary assessment it was found that the glacial burst happened in the morning between 9.30 am-10 am which damaged the under-construction Rishiganga dam project there,"" chief minister Rawat told reporters before leaving for Joshimath.

""At the time of the incident, there were some workers and labourers working at the site but as of now it is difficult to reveal anything about their status,” he said.

According to a government official, the project manager of the Rishiganga hydel power project had informed that 50 workers were missing.

The CM also said that the government has shifted the residents near the river to safer places and asked certain dams to open the gates to allow the increased water to flow down.

""The Srinagar dam opened its gates to allow the water flow down but the bigger Tehri dam had been asked to hold the water. Apart from this we have also alerted the workers working at the Karnprayag railway line to shift to safe places,"" said Rawat.

He added that the state government is in touch with the Centre which has assured all possible assistance in rescue work.

""Rescue work is already being carried by SDRF, police, ITBP and army. Soon NDRF personnel will also reach here from Delhi,"" he said.",2021-02-07 08:00:00+00:00,"['working', 'glacier', 'workers', 'places', 'damaged', 'water', 'rishiganga', 'rawat', 'project', 'missing', 'dam', 'dams', 'burst', 'underconstruction', '50', 'uttarakhand', 'rescue']",India,news article,English

HOIMA- As the country gears up for the reopening of schools for finalists, pupils of Primary Seven at Toonya Primary School in Buseruka sub-county, Hoima district, remain in uncertainty after their school was cut off by floods from Lake Albert.

The floods, which began in early April, have moved inland by over a kilometre from the shore, paralysing the activities of the fishing community on several landing sites.Henry Katalibabo, the Toonya A LCI chairperson, told New Vision that 222 houses, accommodating 1,068 people, have been affecteVd.

""The water levels keep rising. We are worried of the likely destruction of our homes,"" he said. Katalibabo said some pupils will be required to board canoes twice before accessing the area designated to accommodate them.

Moses Kyaligonza, the Toonya Primary School headteacher, said when schools were closed in March, they had 450 pupils with 38 in Primary Seven. Kyaligonza said it would be better to have these children accommodated in one place for their safety because trekking daily from their homes is risky.

Accommodation for teachers is also a big challenge because the flooded school had eight staff quarters. The houses that would have been rented by the teachers have also been affected by floods.

Dr Fredrick Byenume, the Hoima district health inspector, said waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery are likely to result from the floods.

""There is no doubt that the water is contaminated with faecal matter because all the pit latrines are filled up by water,"" Byenume said. He said they are planning to distribute chlorine tablets to purify the water as one way of preventing waterborne diseases.Byenume appealed to the public to desist from open defecation to avoid further contamination of the water.He said both the school and Toonya Health Centre III have been declared unfit for human use.

Joselyne Nyangoma, the Hoima district natural resources officer, said the flood waters have brought with them crocodiles and hippopotami, which are a danger to residents.

""You need to be careful with your movements in these flood waters because crocodiles have now left the main lake and settled outside,"" she said.

Dr Charles Kajura, the chairperson of Hoima district disaster management committee, said they had asked parents and school management committees to agree on the best modalities to safeguard the children returning to school.",2020-10-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['hoima', 'toonya', 'primary', 'flood', 'pupils', 'uganda', 'uncertainty', 'district', 'crocodiles', 'cut', 'floods', 'water', 'school', 'waters', 'schools']",Uganda,news article,English

629,Drought Sri Lanka,A lifeline under siege - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/a-lifeline-under-siege/article4397277.ece,"Though they play a vital role in sustaining the eco-system, the country’s natural wetlands are falling prey to rising pollution and urbanisation

The World Wetlands Day (WWD) was observed sporadically across India on February 2 and yet many of us are not aware about the richness and necessity of wetlands in our lives. While wetlands are nature’s water storage and water purification zones, they are also a paradise for wildlife, fishing, angling and bird-watching, water sports, relaxation and rejuvenation. Scientists believe that wetlands are the kidneys of nature. Unfortunately, wetlands today have become mere dumping grounds for garbage, rapidly throttling the water bodies.

Over the centuries, India had a number of sustainable natural wetlands and these were the lifeline of local communities who depended on these water bodies for staple food, livestock grazing, fodder, fuel-wood transport and irrigation. In addition to the natural wetlands were a number of man-made traditional reservoirs constructed virtually in every town and village — supplying water for everyday needs. However, with booming population and burgeoning urbanisation, these self-sustaining water bodies have become increasingly filthy and unfit for human utilisation. Even the beautiful lotus and water lilies, which were part and parcel of wetlands, have disappeared in many regions.

The country’s rivers have turned into giant gutters carrying waste released by thousands of towns and cities. Although considerable money has been spent to cleanse these waterways, the government’s indifference and citizens’ ignorance have resulted in the continuation of debris being dumped into the rivers. It is estimated that three billion litres of sewage flows into the Ganga alone daily with industries also contributing their effluents.

Over the years, wetlands have been neglected and have not gained importance as other areas of nature and wildlife conservation. It is imperative that wetlands occupy the heart of conservation efforts as water management is at the core of sustainable uses of wetlands. Water scarcity today is becoming an urgent problem for mankind that needs effective remediation.

For the WWD this year, the theme set by UNESCO’s Hydrological Programme was ‘Wetlands Take Care of Water’. It reflected the interdependence between water and wetlands. “Making the link between wetlands and water is essential because without water there will be no wetlands — and without wetlands there will be no water! Wetlands such as mangroves, bogs, freshwater swamps are home to a wealth of biodiversity. Wetlands fulfil vital roles in carbon storage, pollution control and protection from natural hazards such as floods and storms. Millions of people around the world relay on wetlands as it provide ecosystem services such as food, fresh water and fuel,” says Mark Smith, director of IUCN’s Global Water Programme.

By the virtue of its geographical location, varied terrain and climatic zones, India supports a rich diversity of inland and coastal wetlands; but they are in distress currently. The Wular Lake in Kashmir or Kolleru Lake in Andhra Pradesh, two of the largest lakes in the country, are depleting as they are losing their vitality to regenerate. The story is similar for other lakes and rivers across the subcontinent.

The National Wetland Atlas, prepared by Space Applications Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), has classified 67,429 wetlands in India occupying 60 million hectares, including paddy cultivation. The majority of these inland wetlands are dependent on major rivers like the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Narmada, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery. However, with rising water pollution, drought and water battles between various States, conservation of wetlands needs to be taken up on a war footing.

Fortunately, some of the wetlands are receiving their due importance for their contribution to the natural wealth. For instance, the Chilika Lake in Odisha is about to become the first lake from Asia to adopt the “Ecosystem Health Report Card” — an effective means of tracking and reporting the health of a wetland. The Chilika will join the elite club of iconic wetlands like Chesapeake Bay (U.S.A) and the Great Barrier Reef (Australia).

“Increased human population around wetlands adds to ecological degradation due to unsustainable practices like agriculture expansion and over-exploitation. Due to this both wildlife and people suffer, particularly water birds like the cormorants. The condition of the existing wetlands needs to be conserved as our natural assets. With judicious use of numerous useful aquatic bacteria, plants and animals associated with wetlands, harmful impurities can be removed and water can be purified,” says Emeritus Professor C.R. Babuin, in-charge of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, University of Delhi.",2013-02-10 08:00:00+00:00,"['india', 'natural', 'lifeline', 'rivers', 'water', 'wetlands', 'pollution', 'ecosystem', 'wildlife', 'siege', 'lake', 'needs']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Elderly residents and small children clung to inflatable tyres as soldiers and police used rope lines to bring them to safety beyond rising floodwater in Cambodias western province of Battambang, which is expected to worsen on Sunday.

Hundreds of families in three Cambodian provinces  Pursat, Battambang and Pailin  have been forced to evacuate amid extreme rainfall heralding the arrival of a tropical depression across the Mekong region.

A two-year-old child and 57-year-old man have drowned in the flood, Seak Vichet, a spokesman for the Cambodian national committee for disaster management told the AFP news agency late on Saturday.

Authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the damage or people affected but expect the situation to get worse.

In central Vietnam, almost a metre of rain has fallen in recent days.

Five people have died with eight still missing as floodwaters inundated more than 33,000 homes and forced more than 26,000 people to evacuate, the official disaster management authority said.

The national highway linking northern Vietnam to the south has been flooded, while airlines cancelled some domestic flights, local media report.

Roads also turned to rivers and water inundated properties in Thailands Nakhon Ratchasima province, as residents scrambled to place sandbags and move their belongings to higher ground.

Provincial Governor Vichien Chantaranothai said the Pak Chong district was the hardest hit, with 8,000 households and 12,000 people affected. About 200 homes were inundated.

684,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,More than 52 million people across Africa going hungry as weather extremes hit the continent [EN/AR] - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/more-52-million-people-across-africa-going-hungry-weather-extremes-hit-continent-enar,"Millions displaced; women, girls hit hardest; crises compounded by conflicts, poverty and inequality; $700m average climate-related losses; urgent action needed now

More than 52 million people in 18 countries across southern, eastern and central Africa are facing up to crisis levels of hunger as a result of weather extremes, compounded by poverty and conflict.

Some areas are facing a second extreme drought in four years and worse than that sparked by El Nino in 1981.

In the South, parts of Zimbabwe have had their lowest rainfall since 1981 which has helped push more than 5.5m people into extreme food insecurity. Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been decimated and exports are now banned; 2.3m people there are food insecure. The situation is worsening including in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar, Namibia and Zimbabwe. There are reports of farmer suicides in South Africa.

Drought has also hit the East and Horn of Africa particularly Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. At the same time, record-breaking temperatures in the Indian Ocean have dumped ultra-heavy rainfalls into Kenya and South Sudan, causing flash-flooding especially along major river arteries. South Sudan has declared a state of emergency with more than 900,000 people hit by floods.

In Africa extreme weather events have hit many countries already suffering from ongoing conflict. Across the continent, 7.6 million people were displaced by conflict in the first six months of 2019, and another 2.6 million by extreme weather. In the Horn, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan have simultaneously faced over 750 000 people displaced by conflict and 350 000 displaced by extreme weather.

Scientists have demonstrated how climate change is increasing the frequency or severity of many extreme weather events. Over the last decade, these 18 African countries have collectively suffered average annual losses of $700m from climate-related disasters– and this is without counting the cost of these latest crises, says Oxfam. However, there has been minimal progress globally in raising funds specifically to address loss and damage from climate change. Africa contributes less than 5% of total global emissions but is suffering some of the most severe impacts of the climate crisis.

Officials will meet at the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in Durban Nov 11-15 to discuss the future of Africa’s “environmental sustainability and prosperity”. Oxfam urges ministers to demand that industrial nations honour their promises to avoid escalating human and financial costs and to pay for damages.

“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently. The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering,” said Oxfam’s Southern Africa Regional Director Nellie Nyang'wa.

“In western Kenya, the crop harvest is 25% down and in parts of Somalia up to 60%. Livestock in many rural areas are emaciated and milk production is down. Cereal prices in some areas have rocketed up to five-year highs, pricing out poorer people. Nearly 7m people in the region are living just below the catastrophic hunger line,” said Oxfam’s Horn, East and Central Africa regional director Lydia Zigomo. “It is a vicious cycle where poor and marginalized communities, mostly women and girls, are more exposed to the climate crisis and less able to cope and recover from its harm.”.

Mithika Mwenda, chief executive of Oxfam’s partner PACJA, said “communities at the frontline of this climate crisis are overstretched and may be facing potential annihilation. But local people are doing everything that can to overcome the challenge. There are unprecedented levels of organization happening where governments have let local people down.”

“We’re seeing people trying to cope with shifting seasons and erratic rainfall by finding new ways to make a living off-farm. Women are coming together to pool their resources through small internal lending communities, buying food together, growing sweet potatoes instead of maize – all without outside support. Local people have the solutions but what they lack is resources, especially funding.

“Our leaders should look to support these community solutions to build up people’s resilience to climate change. For 35 years AMCEN has been a very important platform with impactful policies that have helped to create awareness of environmental sustainability. It needs to move away now from policy making to policy implementation.”

Oxfam is currently reaching more than 7 million people in ten of the hardest hit countries with food and water support, and long-term development projects to help people cope better with climate-related shocks. Oxfam plans to reach 10% of those most in need in these ten countries and is trying to raise $65m to do so.

Oxfam is calling on African ministers at the AMCEN meeting to:

• Insist rich industrialised countries decrease their CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global heating to below 1.5C, and honour their commitment to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries;

• Demand governments agree to develop a new funding mechanism for “loss and damage” from climate change at the upcoming UN climate conference (COP25);

• Invest more into universal, high-quality and gender-responsive public services and strengthen tax systems in African countries to close the gap between rich and poor;

• Improve their disaster warning and management systems, and commit to re-greening and agricultural policies that target women and men small-scale farmers;

• Invest in “social accountability” projects that ensures climate finance can reach the communities that need it most, and empowering them in their own decision-making

• Engage women and girls in the planning, design and implementation of early warning systems and climate mitigation and adaptation programs

• Protect people who are forced to move so that they are able to do so in safety, dignity and on their own terms.

• Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains including nine children who died after their house flooded in Banadir on 7 May and four people killed by lightening in Puntland on 5 May.

• An estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle region were affected by riverine flooding has affected, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms.

Authorities and partners are scaling up responses.

• FAO/SWALIM has warned of the imminent danger of potentially unprecedented flooding expected along the Shabelle river in the coming days and the concern for safety and wellbeing of the people in Belet Weyne and along the river.

• Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, flooding three villages.

Situation overview

Heavy Gu season rains have hit various parts of the country over the last week triggering flash floods and inundating vast swathes of land, but the short-term forecast suggests the heavy rainfall will begin to subside from mid-May onward.1 Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains: nine children in Banadir who died after their house flooded on 7 May; three people killed by lightning in Puntland and one child that fell into a pond of water on 5 May; four children who died in adam full of rainwater in Sool region on 7 May; one person killed by flooding in Buurhakaba, Bay region and seven IDPs who died on 9 May in Garasbaley district, Banadir, following the collapse of their house due to heavy rains. In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms.

In Somaliland, heavy rains on 30 April flooded the dry river valley in Hargeisa, affecting around 40 houses and washing away seven vehicles. The floods also temporally affected some of the IDPs who are living in sub-standard shelters.

Partners report that the intermittent rains characterized by violent storms left an estimated 359 households (2,154 people) homeless, with some temporarily squatting on private land and others seeking refuge with relatives.2 On 7 May, four children, aged 10 to 13 died in a water dam at Goljano village in Caynabo district, Sool region. On 5 May, the Somaliland meteorological department issued a forecast of heavy rains for next week in Awdal, Waqooyi Galbeed and Sanaag regions and warned people living in low-lying areas to prepare for possible flash floods.

In Puntland, torrential rains and flash floods on 5 May affected the Bossaso-Garowe road. The main bridge was damaged, making it impassable for traders. According to the Puntland Disaster Management Authority and local elders, at least three people were killed by a lightning strike and a child died after falling into a pond of water. Damage to two bridges on Qayaadsame river affected the movement of goods and people from Bossaso. In addition, flash floods washed away over 1,250 heads of livestock and damaged shelters in low lying areas of Ceel Daahir under Bossaso district and Berri Cad under Garowe between 27 April and 5 May.

The flooding in Jowhar occurred due to open breakages along the river. The road between Jowhar and Mahaday through airport road is inaccessible. On 1 May, a breakage along the riverbank at Moyko closed the main road connecting Jowhar to Mogadishu through Balcad. This is the main transportation route for food and other essential commodities.

FAO/SWALIM issued a flood advisory on 8 May indicating that observed levels of the Shabelle River have continued to rise alarmingly in the past two weeks. According to FAO/SWALIM, there is a high flood risk in Belet Weyne in the coming days and in middle and lower reaches due to heavy rains in Hiraan and Middle Shabelle regions.

Heavy rains in South West State on 8 May killed at least one person and 28 livestock in Buurhakaba town. Some 112 houses were either damaged or destroyed and around 615 households (3,690 people) were displaced mainly from lowlying flood-prone areas. The rains have also disrupted transport between main towns in parts of South West State. Low lying sections of Afgooye town have been inundated, affecting around 20 households. The routes to the villages have been cut off by rains and the movement of people and traffic remain restricted. Further reports indicate that around 3,500 people have been displaced by flash floods in Damaley, Balguri and Raqeyke villages of Afgooye town. The flash floods damaged unconfirmed hectares of farmlands with crops.

In Galmudug, several trucks loaded with food commodities got stuck in muddy roads between Cadaado and Cabudwaaq following moderate rains on 2 May. About 100 goats were killed by a thunderstorm in Xanabura rural village, Cabudwaaq district.

Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow on 9 May, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, following heavy rains in the Somali region of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Highlands. Three villages, Warayle, Buula Qalooc and Bara Baraay, were flooded affecting about 35 farms. The Dawa river may also break its banks. The local authority in Doolow has alerted farmers to the situation and water pumps have been relocated from the river.

A neighborhood in Ceelqalaw area in Wadajir district, Banadir, was submerged, forcing about 1,500 people to leave their homes. Two houses collapsed and several others were partially destroyed. The lowland areas and main access roads in Wadijir district are the worst affected. Wadajir district is one of the areas where a large number of families recently relocated due to recent elections-related violence. On 9 May, local sources in Garasbaley district reported that seven IDPs died following the collapse of their house due to heavy rainfall in Al Adale IDP camp. Five other people were severely injured and five houses destroyed.

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. The country has, since 1990, experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. As of April, more than 80 per cent of the country was experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions following below average October to December 2020 Deyr rains, followed by a harsh and warmer than normal January to March Jilaal season and a delayed and poor start of the current April to June Gu season. Despite the heavy rains that have hit parts of Somalia, the rains have come too late for the planting season; therefore, further exacerbating already significant food security concerns.",2021-05-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['killed', 'season', 'floods', 'rains', 'river', 'heavy', 'gu', 'died', 'flash', 'district', 'update', 'flooding', '2021', 'villages', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

769,FL-2019-000022-IRN,At least 62 people killed in Iran floods as US accused of blocking aid - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/iran-floods-death-toll-reaches-62,"The death toll from two weeks of flooding in Iran has risen to 62 as frustration mounts inside the country at the government’s handling of the crisis and an international dispute has broken out over whether renewed US sanctions are blocking aid.

Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have been engaged in a war of words over the crisis. Zarif attacked the US for “economic terrorism” and said it was blocking the shipment of vital rescue equipment.

“[Donald Trump’s] ‘maximum pressure’ is impeding aid efforts by the Iranian Red Crescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods. Blocked equipment includes relief choppers,” he said on Twitter.

He also attacked European countries for hesitating to help over fears of violating sanctions, adding: “Europe can’t muster political will to defy US.”

Pompeo responded with an attack on Iranian government failings. “These floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness,” he said in a statement that offered condolences and made an offer of aid, but with no details.

Inside Iran, the crisis has exposed tensions between the reformist president, Hassan Rouhani, and his hardline opponents including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), with the two camps launching public attacks on each other over management of the floods and their aftermath.

The disaster has also fuelled public anger, particularly in areas where rescue and aid services have often been slow to arrive. In one possible attempt to dampen protests, the governor of a northern province was fired for failing to return home from abroad to manage the crisis.

The flooding, which began in late March, has turned the normally joyful Persian new year, or Nowruz, celebrations into a time of mourning, deprivation and fear for many Iranians.

The devastation has not been limited to one corner of Iran; the north-east was hit first and then, with the country still reeling, the south-west was also swamped.

Deaths have been reported in more than a third of the country’s 31 provinces. Among the hardest hit areas was the city of Shiraz, where over a month’s worth of rain fell in a day, most of it in two intense 15-minute downpours.

The scale of the damage has been so bad that authorities have banned foreign journalists from visiting the worst affected area, the New York Times reported.

But terrifying videos posted on social media showed flood waters sweeping away whole houses, ripping desperate people from poles they had clung to for support and carrying cars along like children’s toys, some with people still inside.

The new death toll of 62 was given by Ahmad Shojaee, the head of the Iranian Legal Medicine Organisation. The semi-official Isna news agency reported that it was based only on bodies transferred to coroners, so may rise further.

Tens of thousands more have been displaced, and many may have been made permanently homeless by the flooding. But getting in relief supplies is likely to remain a challenge for months to come.

Thousands of roads have been blocked or washed away and 84 bridges destroyed, making rescue operations complicated, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Organisation told state TV.

“[In total] 141 rivers burst their banks and around 400 landslides were reported,” said Behnam Saeedi, a spokesman for the organisation.

The damaged roads make up about a third of the national network. Sanctions mean the country has not been able to update its fleet of rescue helicopters.

The United Nations said at the start of the crisis that it was ready to offer help, but also warned that “challenges caused by unilateral sanctions will affect the UN response and the accountability of UN to deliver the appropriate support”, the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said in a statement.

The tepid international response is in marked contrast to the crisis after the Bam earthquake in 2003, when the world raced to offer help after the historic city was nearly totally destroyed.

346,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Making 1 billion people safer from disaster by 2025: UK commitments to reach REAP's goal - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/making-1-billion-people-safer-disaster-2025-uk-commitments-reach-reap-s-goal,"UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency announced UK commitments at the Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) pledging meeting.

Excellencies, friends, on behalf of the governments of Saint Lucia and the UK and the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership – welcome to you all.

Thank you for joining today’s important discussions to determine how to scale up early action on disasters.

We must reach REAP’s goal of making 1 billion people safer from disaster by 2025.

Between 1970 and 2019, 79% of disasters involved weather, climate and water-related hazards. 70% of resultant deaths occurred in the Least Developed Countries.

Sadly, these events will only increase. But increasing also is our ability to forecast and forewarn: over half of humanitarian needs stem from ‘predictable’ events.

But still only 1% of humanitarian finance is prearranged. This is not good enough.

This is where REAP partners come in. We are already seeing the benefits of early action. But we must see early action mainstreamed, embedded into policy and plans. As we heard at the Climate and Development Ministerial at the end of March, early action is a priority for developing countries.

So we must work together to make risk-informed early action the default position.

In 2019 the UK committed £175 million to REAP targets. Since then, we have continued to provide expert technical support to REAP.

And the UK funds the REAP Secretariat, who brought us all here today, finding common solutions to global problems.

The UK is a contributor to the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF), including its Forecast-based Action window.

The UK is working with the British Red Cross to increase access to Forecast-based Finance, supporting early action in Southern Africa and the Sahel.

As one of the largest donors to UN OCHA’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the UK supports its allocation of up to $140 million to Anticipatory Action, tackling food insecurity in Ethiopia and Somalia, and flooding in Bangladesh.

The UK has invested in expanding disaster risk insurance, so that governments can access cover at reduced prices.

The African Risk Capacity (ARC) enables governments to insure against drought, and the ARC has provided $500 million in drought risk coverage, and $64 million for early responses.

The UK is the largest contributor to the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), which disbursed $20 million to support St Vincent and the Grenadines, to provide money fast after the recent volcanic eruption.

So today, the UK would like to demonstrate further commitments to REAP:

To advance progress on Target 1, the UK will fund work with a priority group of vulnerable countries, to review and integrate climate and disaster laws, policies and procedures.

Partners will develop robust and appropriate policy frameworks, and effective disaster risk management plans.

To advance progress on Target 2, we will provide expert support to strengthen and expand shock-responsive social protection.

Today we are committing an additional £12 million to the Start Network’s Start Fund, so that frontline actors can respond swiftly and ahead of underfunded humanitarian crises.

This money will enable Start Network to develop an innovative series of ‘hubs’ to improve forecasting and locally-led action.

A further £8 million will support the Centre for Disaster Protection to help climate-vulnerable countries to prepare for disasters.

Our progress relies on strong evidence:

The UK-funded Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) will work with REAP to address research needs, ensuring that strong evidence underpins the fulfilment of targets.

REAP partners are invited to work with us, to ensure research benefits the end user. Because as well as scaling up, REAP calls us to change how we manage risk.

The UK’s FCDO is integrating a climate and environment risk assessment into all of its new programming.

The UK’s G7 presidency has focused on anticipating shocks and acting early.

The UK secured G7 commitment to do more, by pre-agreeing emergency funding so that countries can act early.

The UK led the development of the G7 Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Crises Compact to increase anticipatory action and support to the CERF.

At the G7 in June, we hope to lead the way with more ambitious commitments to REAP targets.

At COP26 in November, we will demonstrate further investment in climate services and disaster risk reduction.

So now, it’s over to all of you:

Those who have come forward to act on avoidable losses, and those who feel their impacts first-hand.

We look forward to hearing what you can offer this ambitious partnership, where you can make investments that make a difference, and, indeed, how your experiences have lead to change.

So, thank you to all of you for your collaboration, your commitment and your ambition for this lifesaving agenda.

I will now hand to my colleague Diann Black-Layne, Ambassador for Climate Change and Director of the Department of the Environment of Antigua and Barbuda. Welcome Diana, it will be wonderful to hear your reflections.",2021-05-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['early', 'climate', 'reap', 'million', 'making', 'disaster', 'goal', 'world', 'risk', 'support', 'action', 'reach', 'billion', 'reaps', 'work', 'safer', 'commitments', 'uk']",Somalia,news article,English
1033,FL-2020-000207-NGA,Why Lagosians should heed flood alert | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World NewsOpinion  The Guardian Nigeria News  Nigeria and World News - Guardian,https://guardian.ng/opinion/why-lagosians-should-heed-flood-alert/,"Sir: On April 14, 2021, the Lagos State Government predicted high intensity of rainfall of 261 days this year, with an attendant flooding across the state. The state, therefore, directed its residents in coastal and low-lying wetland areas to move upland in order to avert avoidable loss of lives and properties. This was made known by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello at a media briefing on 2021 Seasonal Climate Predictions and Socio-Economic Implications for Lagos State, held at Alausa, Ikeja. In the words of Bello, Lagos State shall experience a rainy season of 238-261 days, while Maximum Annual Rainfall Amount is predicted to be 1747mm. It is also expected that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events indicate that year 2021 will likely experience days with extremely high rainfall amounts which may result in flooding.

In downscaling the predictions of the flood alerts, the state government is therefore collaborating with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). In addition to what the Environment and Water Resources commissioner said, the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, Mr. Joe Igbokwe declared, Iurge residents to support the government to achieve flood-free Lagos and desist from dumping refuse in drainage channels or encroaching on Right of Ways of canals. Regrettably, several of the canals that have been recently cleaned up are again being littered by residents.

x

A secure environment-friendly future is not built on the premises of mere luck with folding of arms; it is deliberately and conscientiously built by treating our environment well. Most roads in the hinterlands do not have gutters to allow rainwater flow when there is heavy downpour. Makeshift water channels could be dug, even if not deep, to ease water flow in such areas. Drainage systems constructed in cities and towns should be deep and wide enough to allow the free flow of flood water. For rural dwellers, they should desist from the unhealthy habit of dumping refuse in drainage channels. This act is also prevalent in cities as they empty their waste bins in the rains thinking the dirt will flow with the rainwater whereas it comes back to hurt and harm the residents. While government plays its role in providing social amenities and infrastructures for citizens, Lagos residents must also do their best to maintain them. Let it also be added that, as citizens await provision of public amenities by government, they are duty-bound to provide themselves the needed facilities in the interim.

We cannot prevent the rains from falling in its season, but we can prevent the rage of water. Natures fierceness occasioned by continuous furious downpour can be avoided if we take good care of our environment. In the overall interest of the safety of lives and properties, every resident must brace for the rainy days ahead in order to be prepared for the peak period.

1065,FL-2020-000207-NGA,ACAPS Briefing Note: Nigeria - Floods (26 September 2018) - Nigeria - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/acaps-briefing-note-nigeria-floods-26-september-2018,"Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, river levels in most of the 12 affected states remain high due to flooding, which has affected 441,251 people, and displaced 141,369 people between late August and 24 September. A total of 108 deaths and 192 injuries have been reported as of late August. Rainfall is expected to continue for the next week. Rivers and Bayelsa states are estimated to be amongst the worst affected states where water levels continue to rise. Initial assessments indicate that 13,031 homes were damaged or destroyed across all affected states as of late August. Shelter, food, NFIs and medical assistance continue to be key needs for the affected population

Crisis impact

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, widespread flooding due to ongoing rainfall has affected 441,250 people and displaced 141,400 people in Adamawa, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Delta, Edo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, Rivers, and Taraba states since late August (NEMA 24/09/2018; ERCC; 24/09/2018).

As of 24 September, flooding across 12 states and 50 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in central and southern Nigeria has caused 108 deaths and 192 injuries (NEMA 24/09/2018). Across all affected states, there is an urgent need for shelter, with around 13,000 houses damaged (NEMA 24/09/2018). The affected population has lost household and personal belongings. The floods have caused considerable damage to agricultural land across Nigeria, with 122,653 hectares of agricultural land destroyed. In addition to shelter, there is an urgent need for food, NFIs and medicine (NEMA 24/09/2018). The flooding is widespread and situation is rapidly evolving. As assessments are ongoing, the number of the affected people is expected to further increase.

Initial assessments indicate that Rivers and Bayelsa are amongst the most affected states. Water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa. As of 24 September, water levels in lower Benue state have subsided to 10m, compared to 11m on 21 September.

The Niger River at Lokoja city, Kogi state, has not receded, as it recorded water levels of 11.05m on 24 September (NEMA 24/09/2018). Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue until early October.

Shelter: Flooding has displaced around 141,400 people across the 12 affected states, of which 80,600 people are estimated to be living with friends and family (NEMA 24/09/2018). Over 13,000 houses have been partially or totally damaged. IDPs have relocated to emergency shelters, such as LGA offices, schools, stadiums and churches.

Some of the affected population is staying in IDP camps that have been recently constructed by the Presidential Committee on Flood Relief and Rehabilitation (NEMA 21/09/2018). As assessments are ongoing, and water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa states, the amount of houses damaged, which are typically built with mud and thatch roods, is likely to increase (IFCR 23/09/2018). The affected population are in urgent need of shelter support and NFIs, such as blankets, mats, hygiene kits and kitchen sets (IFCR 23/09/2018).

Livelihood: New estimates indicate that 122,653 hectares of agricultural land have been flooded across central and southern Nigeria. Crops were destroyed before the harvesting season begins in October (NYTimes 17/08/2018). This makes the affected population more vulnerable to food insecurity, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of farmers. Flooding is also likely to affect other livelihoods, such as fishers and petty traders.

Food: There continues to be an urgent need for food assistance for IDPs across all affected states. Severe flood damage to agricultural crops means there is a risk that some communities will experience increased food insecurity throughout the harvest season. (Daily Trust 20/09/2018). There are still no reports on whether markets that have been flooded and closed. Transportation of food is likely to be severely restricted because main roads have been flooded.

Health: Since the publication of the briefing note on 21 September, 192 injuries have been reported since late August. Flood affected victims are likely to be in urgent medical care, as result of injuries and the risk of outbreaks made worse due to the extensive flooding. Health care support is particularly needed in IDP camps (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The risk that diarrhoea and cholera will spread remains high, as water levels continue to rise in Rivers and Bayelsa, and have mostly not subsided in other communities.

Particularly in more populated areas, and overcrowded IDP camps where WASH facilities are inadequate, there continues to be a high concern for cholera to spread further. There have been reports of an increase in diarrhoea cases in four of the flood affected states (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of geographical information and data indicating which states are affected by the spike in diarrhoea cases. 27,927 cases of suspected cholera were reported between 1 January and 10 September countrywide (NCDC 10/09/2018). Between 1 January and 10 September, suspected cholera cases were reported in the flood affected states of Adamawa (2,002), Anambra (23), Bayelsa (no data), Benue (no data), Delta (no data), Edo (no data), Kebbi (198), Kogi (102), Kwara (no data), Niger (547), Rivers (no data), and Taraba (no data). (NCDC 10/09/2018). In Adamawa, an increase of 119 suspected cholera cases was observed between 17-23 September, most likely due to flooding facilitating the spread (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 23/09/2018)

As flooding has not receded, the escalation of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and-or West Nile fever remains a concern (WHO 2018). The Government recently confirmed that the malaria cases have increased due to the floods (IFCR 23/09/2018).

The current malaria incidence in Nigeria is 380.8/1,000 (2015) (PMI 2017). A distribution of mosquito nets for the flood affected population has been identified as a key priority (NEMA 24-09-2018 NaijaNews 18/09/2018).

Since the publication of ACAPS Nigeria Floods Briefing Note on 21 September, there have been additional reports in local media sources that indicate antenatal care for pregnant women remains a key concern. This was reported in Uzanu community, Estako East LGA, Edo state and in Ogbaru, Amambra.

There is a need for psychosocial support, as flood victims have lost or been separated from their loved ones (IFCR 23/09/2018).

WASH: The displaced population is still staying in emergency shelters, such LGA offices, stadiums, schools and churches, which have inadequate sanitation facilities and are in urgent need of safe water. In most of the affected states, water sources have been contaminated by flooding (IFCR 23/09/2018). There is a lack of data on the potential amount of damaged water points.

Education: Schools continue to be used as evacuation centres across all affected states. On 18 September, primary and secondary schools were closed in Ogbaru, Southern Anambra state as a safety measure, following floods that displaced more than 1,1000 people (OCHA 24/09/2018). Considering the ongoing flooding, it is likely that many schools have been damaged by flooding (Premium Times 19/09/2018).

Protection: While there is no disaggregated data available on the amount of women and girls affected by the floods, it is likely that this group is disproportionately affected.

Women and girls that are displaced and staying in IDP camps continue to be at increased risk to gender-based violence. Overcrowding at IDP camps, with a lack of privacy and inadequate toilets and washing facilities, increases the risks and vulnerability of women and girls to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (UNHCR 12/2017; OCHA 2016).

Impact on critical infrastructure

Since the start of the rainy season, in June, main roads have been flooded and bridges collapsed (Vanguard 15/09/2018). As water levels have not subsided and heavy rainfall is expected to continue until the beginning of October, main roads continue to be flooded across all affected states.

Power and telecommunications are affected in some of the flood-affected states. The Okpai Gas Independent Power Plant in Ndokwa East Council, Delta State, with power supply to Aso Villa, Abuja has been flooded (TheGuardian 25/09/2018). Communities in Kdokwa West and Ukwuani councils are also affected by the power cut.

Some LGA offices in affected are also likely to be impacted, as they are being used as emergency shelters for the flood affected population.",2018-09-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['2018', 'data', 'likely', 'water', '26', 'flooding', 'continue', 'nema', 'flood', 'floods', 'states', 'levels', 'note', 'nigeria', 'briefing', 'affected', 'acaps']",Nigeria,news article,English

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh.

VnExpresss Hope Foundation is soliciting emergency support for people in central Vietnam, whose lives have been impacted by severe floods and landslides since earlier this month.

When the floodwaters rose on October 12 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Hoang Thi Phuong, a textile worker in Phong Dien District, went into labor.

Her husband tried to take her to hospital, but their motorbike could not cross a flooded section of National Highway 1A. In desperation, he asked a person with a boat to take his wife to the other side.

But the boat capsized just 20 meters from safety. Both Phuong and her unborn baby died.

""I killed you,"" her husband sobbed inconsolably, down on his knees in front of the raging floods that had snatched away his loved ones.

They are not the only victims of the tragedy that has befallen central Vietnam in the last two weeks. Dozens of others, including at least two hydropower plant workers and 13 members of a rescue team, lost their lives to landslides in Thua Thien-Hue.

In the last 10 days nonstop rain and floods have submerged entire regions under a sea of water and triggered massive landslides in mountainous areas.

Hundreds of thousands of houses have been engulfed, and the death toll has been rising relentlessly.

Thousands of families face food and water shortages, and the floods do not seem likely to recede any time soon.

As fighters on the frontlines in a battle against nature, soldiers, doctors, rescuers, and thousands of others have had to take on the harsh and unrelenting elements.

What they need right now are boats, medicines, food, clothes, rescue equipment, and other supplies.

The Hope Foundation by VnExpress and FPT is calling for emergency support for millions of people in central Vietnam. We are soliciting help from every person and every section of the community, and trying to find the quickest way to help those in need right now.

We will directly handle all donations and be transparent about how your donations are used.

1106,FL-2017-000017-PAK,UK pledges support for victims of devastating floods in Pakistan - GOV.UK,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-pledges-support-for-victims-of-devastating-floods-in-pakistan,"The announcement was made by Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister of State for South Asia at the UKs Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office, during a virtual visit to Pakistan where he also discussed with the Government of Pakistan how Britain could work with them to tackle climate change.

The 800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to many who have lost their homes. It comes on top of the UKs distribution last week of emergency stocks including hygiene kits and tarpaulins to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Lord Ahmad said:

Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands with Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.

The UK aid announced today will ensure life-saving clean water, sanitation and shelter gets to those who need it most. The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be - and the dangers of climate change.

During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.

British High Commissioner Christian Turner CMG said:

Following Pakistans remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.

As part of Lord Ahmads virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from COVID-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year. He discussed with the Government of Pakistan how the UK can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UKs world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet the Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations, and trade ties, and he also visited a UK-funded girls education programme in South Punjab. The UK has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly 8 million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The Minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the COVID-19 surveillance centre. He met the Coordinator National Emergency Operations Centre Dr Rana Safdar who briefed the Minister on Pakistans response to COVID-19. Lastly, he was scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

Notes to editors:

In Sindh, according to data from the Meteorological Department, rainfall in August was the highest since recordkeeping began 89 years ago. In Karachi, rainwaters devastated factory stock and caused mass power outages. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared calamity affected and local disaster management teams together with NGOs, supported by the military, have been rescuing stranded people, providing medical aid, and food rations. Initial assessments by District authorities suggest that more than 2.5m people have been affected across the worst-hit districts of Badin, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal and Sanghar. In all, monsoon rains have resulted in the death of over 230 people and damaged over 2,600 houses across Pakistan, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). The UK has committed at least 11.6 billion in International Climate Finance over the next five years, and will invest 13 million in Pakistan this year on tackling climate change. This will include supporting local communities adapt to climate change and improve resilience through emergency disaster planning and helping to increase the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency.

23,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"Column: Mia Lehrer on what makes a successful park, and how L.A. can build them - Los Angeles Times",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-morrison-lehrer-20140806-column.html,"Landscape architect Mia Lehrer has designed some lavish private gardens in Los Angeles, but she has also made her mark with “guerrilla planning,” creating and blue-skying plans for parks and public spaces, from the harbor to Silver Lake. She’s Salvadoran by birth, and alert to analyzing how open-space needs and use by newcomers may teach L.A. how to enhance its footprint. Now that the drought is dictating terms, it’s also making new ones possible, and Lehrer doesn’t intend to miss the opportunity that scarce water provides to get Angelenos to regard the natural world in a way that makes sense here and now.

Out your office window, I see a lawn with a copse of pine trees in front of an office building. Size up that space for me.

It’s a simple park. There are people doing yoga, kids throwing balls, people with their dogs. It’s designed by Peter Walker, who was a professor and partner of mine. He did the World Trade Center. It’s used so much, and it speaks to the kind of spaces we need. You could use lawn varieties that use less water, also gray water from the building. You could drip-irrigate the pines once a week, the lawn could be a native meadow — and the doggies will be playing, people will still be doing yoga, but you would [cut] 75% of the water used now. Getting rid of 100% of lawns is not necessarily realistic for a city that needs these little oases. The issue is that about 70% of our lawns are in backyards, an enormous amount of water is used for them, and they’re more visual than functional. We can educate people about options.

What makes a successful park?

Advertisement

It relates to scale, who’s going to be there, what reflects the culture and interests of the community. People’s first notion about a park is Central Park — big, grassy, lush. So adjusting expectations about that aesthetic, we have a hard row to hoe in L.A. This is the era for our city to think about parks and the river and the urban forest as all one thing.

Why are you a landscape architect?

I like to call myself an urbanist. What designers bring to the table is visualization. We can help people understand the solutions.

Is L.A.'s need for park space different from other places’?

From the advent of the car through the 1980s, Los Angeles was this aspiration: having your own little oasis. The private outweighed the public realm. The city was alienating; you didn’t have a sense of the common good. The private-public gardens like Descanso, the Arboretum, the Huntington are wonderful assets, but you couldn’t just walk down the street [to them]. Things changed dramatically in part because of the leadership, and as public transit began to be layered into the city.

The norm being aspired to across the country is a 15-minute-maximum walk to your closest park. We just don’t have that. We did a lot of great planning — beautiful highways and streets, [but] look how many parks we cut in half to do that: Hollenbeck and Echo Park and MacArthur Park. Environmental justice-wise, wow.

Your Vista Hermosa Park was the first new public park in downtown in more than 100 years. It isn’t just grass and a couple of trees, or just open space. It’s about what a live bird looks like, and seeing running water.

There’s a movement of what we call urban ecology. At Vista Hermosa, there’s a terrace of decomposed granite surrounded by flowering plants from the chaparral, there’s the city in the distance, sycamore trees, a playground, water, boulders; at another level you’re in a grotto. One time I was there, a young family was having a picnic. I said, “How do you like it?” The father says: “I wish we had swings. All the rich people’s parks have swings.” I said: “This is a different kind of park.” As we talked, his kid had gone 30 feet up on the boulders and was playing with sticks and he came down all happy.

Is there a way to reverse-engineer existing parks for the drought?

Yes. The decision might be made for us: If we ration, older parks are going to have to live completely differently. We overwater no matter what, two-thirds more than we need. It’s watering, watering, watering.

We need our urban forest — for shade, for air purification, for humanity and pedestrian comfort, to make the city better. We need to think about how we save our tree canopy, making sure we choose the right trees, and where we have trees, how we care for them.

There’s a lot of incredible collaboration between the county and the cities in L.A., this big sea change as we start to understand water. It makes us realize we’re connected, that it’s one water, and we have to think of it as a whole.

You asked Mayor Garcetti to appoint a design czar. What would that position do?

We now have a tech czar, somebody for economic development, somebody for sustainability. In New York, the mayor’s office and planning department and design folks make sure developers and [city officials] all have a vision of what they want to accomplish with good design. L.A. needs somebody really strong who cares about design.

What are you planning for the former Hollywood Park in Inglewood?

There’s a residential community that’s moving forward with a retail center. It’s a lovely neighborhood, apartments to single-family residences and an arroyo that brings water to a lake. Developers who hold water on the site [will] pay less for connections to the [city water] system. You want the developer to be willing to [set aside] 25 acres. We’ve learned that communities with parks, the land value goes up dramatically.

You designed the new gardens at the county Natural History Museum.

The idea was to do an urban ecological laboratory. The scientists are excited to be able to do research in their own backyard, and people are realizing that having nice gardens in these institutions brings people there, brings birds and bees. There’s a dry stream — in California we don’t have water all the time, but we still have sycamores and willows.

You’ve been working for years on reviving the L.A. River.

I can’t tell you how excited we are that our mayor was able to strike a deal with the president and the Army Corps of Engineers. It’s the beginning of a big change. When we started, immigrant families were already using the river to fish and commute on foot. Now it’s a given [for] biking, hiking. It is being included in the 2024 Olympic bid — that’s where the athletes’ village would be.

What do you think of the new Grand Park in Los Angeles’ civic center?

The amount of programming has been amazing. Of course the programming is also expensive. The community benefits tremendously, [but] it’s not necessarily viable for many city parks given the city budget. It speaks to the multicultural community, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it grows.

The more parks, the better, let’s put it that way, but I do think there’s such a thing as too many efforts at the same time. Like Park 101 [a plan to cover the 101 Freeway with a park, from the river to the cathedral]. A park between Olvera Street and downtown makes sense. But however many blocks they were planning? For $800 million? And the river needs love? That’s what I’m saying about [needing] an uber-urban guru.

What about park prospects at a rather desolate place like LAX?

We’re working at LAX. LAX is a complicated property, and I can’t imagine park space there, but there’s hope in [other] ways. LAX is investigating how to make more sense of the property they own, [like] the rental car lots. Do they consolidate the parking? What do they do with the balance of the land? Do they create housing? Hotel/offices? What does the area become?

You mentioned educating people about landscape options — like what?

I have this idea of having a series of native plant nurseries at public properties — state parks, the Arroyo Seco, Ballona — as a way of educating people on what these plants do. We’re doing a workbook with 10 friends of their gardens before and after the big drought. I want trucks like food trucks to go around neighborhoods on Saturday or Sunday with young people who are knowledgeable about plants saying: “Bring me a picture of your garden. Let’s do a scale drawing and help you figure out drought-tolerant plantings.”

There’s a bit of a backlash against palm trees as nonnative and trite. Your gut reaction?

I love palm trees! I will be on a brigade to save palm trees any day. They’re culturally important for Los Angeles. The birds have learned to perch on them, they grow in, they live forever — leave them alone.
