2071,FL-2017-000155-VNM,"Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos Take Stock of Destruction as Region Braces For New Tropical Storm - Radio Free Asia",https://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/destruction-10212020184730.html,"At least 111 people have now been killed in flooding and landslides in central provinces of Vietnam following heavy rains from Oct. 6 to 19, and further deaths are feared as waters continue to rise in rivers in Quang Binh province ahead of a coming tropical storm, sources in the country say.

Highways in the provinces have also been severely damaged, with the total cost of repairs estimated at around VND 355 billion, state media said, citing figures provided by the Directorate of Roads of Vietnam on Oct. 21.

Also on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung and deputies of Vietnams National Assembly welcomed efforts by Vietnamese pop star Thuy Tien to collect more than VND 100 billion (U.S. $15,316,811) for relief work in flood-hit Quang Tri, Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue.

Large-scale fundraising is normally restricted by law to state organizations or social associations to reduce the risk of personal gain, with penalties prescribed for violations. But National Assembly deputy Le Thanh Vanh voiced confidence in the work of Thuy Tien and her staff.

They are ready to take responsibility before the sponsors who donated the funds, Vanh said, quoted on Oct. 21 in state media reports. I am sure they will be completely transparent, he said.

Relief teams have poured for the last few days into central regions hit by floods and landslides that have destroyed roads and buried workers at a hydropower plant and soldiers at a military barracks, Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told state media on Wednesday.

Many areas have already received help, while others remain cut off because of damaged roads, Dung said, calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to send more teams to reach remote areas and give further support to those already helped.

34 now killed in Cambodia

Relief work meanwhile continues in Cambodia, where 34 people have now been killed by floods to date, with Prime Minister Hun Sen urging local authorities to guard damaged homes to prevent looting and calling on banks and other lending institutions to delay or reduce payments owed to them by villagers impoverished by the coronavirus pandemic.

COVID-19 has hit us hard for the last 10 months, and now we are facing floods that are destroying us, Hun Sen said.

We have not concluded our damage assessments yet. For now, we are just working to rescue people and take them to safer areas, he said.

Around 10,000 families have already been safely evacuated from flood-hit areas, Cambodian media sources say.

Speaking to RFA, National Committee for Disaster Management spokesperson Khun Sokha said that flood waters are now receding in several provinces, including Oddor Meanchey, Pursat, Takeo, Pailin, Kampong Speu, Stung Treng, and the two hardest-hit provinces of Banteay Meahchey and Battambang.

The 34 flood deaths reported so far reflect the inability of central government and local authorities to deal effectively with the disaster, said Kean Ponlok, secretary general of the Cambodia Intellectual Students Alliance.

The authorities must look into the causes of these deaths and hold themselves responsible, he said, adding that because of corruption in Cambodia, he is not convinced that all donations handed over to the government will be spent on victims of the floods.

Banteay Meanchey villager Nay Thoeun said she has now lost her home and job because of the floods and is debt after borrowing money from a bank to buy medicine to treat the tuberculosis to which she was exposed in her family.

I am very worried. Im living now under a shelter on a hill, but the water is still rising here, and Im afraid of [venomous insects].

Im urgently calling for aid to be delivered to this hill. There are many poor families here, she said.

Flood begins to recede in Laos

In Laos, flood waters have begun to recede from eight districts in Savannakhet province, where 125 villages containing 5,134 families, or nearly 30,000 people, have been affected, Lao media sources say.

In the provinces Sepon district alone, 40 villages containing nearly a thousand households have been flooded, with many houses completely destroyed, sources said.

Sepons La Or and Vang Khot villages were hardest hit, with 44 houses swept away, and another 90 dwellings hit by fast-running floods and partly damaged, a district official said on Oct. 21.

The district is still asking for help, but we will set up temporary refuges in the villages for people to live in, the official said, adding that funds are being sought for building materials such as roofs and nails for the construction of temporary shelters.

Fast-rising water hit one village on Oct. 18 and swept away 28 or 29 houses, leaving nothing to come back to when villagers returned two days later, one villager said. Now we have no place to stay in but the schools, and no one has any clothing. We are waiting to see how the authorities plan to handle this.

We are all in a very poor condition. We have no rice to eat, and all our rice fields are flooded. We will have to buy all the rice that we eat next year, he said.

The water is receding now, but the villagers houses are damaged beyond repair, and nothing can be restored. There is no thought of fixing them now, a rescue team member said, adding that many residents of Sepon and other districts are still cut off because of damage to the roads.

Though Lao authorities had moved quickly to help victims of the floods, more help is needed, an NGO official said, asking that neither he nor his organization be named. For a start, we urgently need dry food and drinking water, clothes, rice, and many other things, as so many houses have been swept away.

The authorities did go down to do everything they could, but there are just too many villagers to help, he said.

Many residents in areas of Sepon and Phin districts are still out of reach, a Sepon district official said. We are still unable to get to almost half of the areas affected by the floods because the roads have been cut off by landslides, he said.

Losses in Savannakhet including houses damaged, livestock drowned, and paddy fields destroyed are still being calculated, the official Vientiane Times said on Oct. 21.

The 20-year-old will spend the season away from Los Blancos as he looks to land more regular playing time at the top level

Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin​ has been loaned out to Real Valladolid for the upcoming season.

The Ukrainian, signed by the club in June of 2018, spent last season on loan with fellow La Liga side Leganes, but struggled for playing time there as well.

With Thibaut Courtois and Keylor Navas​ both still in the squad for Zinedine Zidane​, chances of seeing the field for Los Blancos this season were slim for the 20-year-old.

Luca Zidane, the son of manager Zinedine and a goalkeeper himself, was also sent out on loan by Real Madrid this season, making it unlikely that Navas, who has been linked with a move to AC Milan, will leave the club this summer.

Ukraine were crowned champions of the Under-20 World Cup after beating South Korea in the final this summer with Lunin awarded the Golden Glove as the tournament's best goalkeeper.

He was expected to return to the club and serve as an understudy to Courtois, with Navas and Zidane departing to make way for the youngster to see the pitch more regularly.

However, the club have now taken the decision to let Lunin go out on loan once again.

Despite consistent links with a move away from Madrid, Navas now appears set to stay, the Costa Rican having made clear last season that he wanted to spend the coming season with the Spanish giants.

""I'm very happy, grateful to God for giving me the chance to be here,"" Navas said back in April as Zidane's side struggled through a poor season.

""Whenever I get the opportunity to play I do the best I can. I hope I can stay at Madrid next season. I have a contract and we have to wait and see if anything changes there.""

Madrid open their La Liga campaign on Saturday against Celta Vigo as the club look to rebound from a season that saw them finish a distant third behind champions Barcelona and runners-up Atletico Madrid.

They’ll also be looking to return to the top of Europe following a Champions League campaign that saw their dominance of the continental competition come to an end thanks to a quarter-final exit at the hands of Ajax.",2019-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['los', 'goalkeeper', 'send', 'valladolid', 'transfer', 'blancos', 'real', 'madrid', 'loan', 'club', 'champions', 'navas', 'lunin', 'zidane', 'season']",Ghana,news article,English

Thousands of people have been displaced following weeks of heavy rainfall in some central and southern states, the country's emergency response agency, NEMA said Tuesday.

Nigeria's two major rivers have burst their banks sweeping away homes in the central part of the country.

Residents steer a dugout canoe past flooded houses in Lokoja capital of Kogi State on September 14, 2018.

The agency warned the situation could worsen as water levels continue to rise in Lokoja capital of Kogi State, which lies at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers and is often one of the most affected states during the rainy season.

Five emergency operation centers have been created to coordinate search and rescue operations, while also providing humanitarian support for those displaced by the floods, Sani Datti, a spokesman for NEMA said.

6,200 mt of food assistance distributed

USD 1.9 m in cash-based transfers (GFD and FFA)

USD 72 million net funding requirements for the lean season (October 2019 – March 2020)

625,575 people received food assistance in September

Operational Updates

• In September, as part of the recovery phase of the emergency response,

WFP provided food assistance to 625,575 people in Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth-affected provinces, working closely with local authorities and humanitarian partners. WFP provided vulnerable households with inkind food assistance and vouchers to purchase commodities. During the relief phase of the emergency response from March to August, WFP supported 2.3 million people with life-saving food assistance in the provinces of Sofala, Manica, Zambezia, Tete, Cabo Delgado and Nampula.

• In September, WFP and the National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC) finalized data collection activities using drones in the Licungo Basin to produce an Atlas for Natural Disaster Preparedness and Response. The team mapped 158,427 Km2 and started a data analysis on 1 October 1.

• WFP is supporting the preparation of the SETSAN (Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition) post-harvest and lean season Food Security and Nutrition assessment that will take place between October and November 2019.

• The report of the Crop and Food Security Assessment mission (CFSAM), jointly conducted by WFP and FAO, was released in September. According to CFSAM findings, the 2019 cereal production is estimated at 2.8 million metric tons, about 16 percent lower than 2018, due to the cyclone-induced crop losses. Considering the extensive crop losses and damage to agricultural livelihoods, it is expected that a substantial proportion of households will continue to depend on food assistance and rely on negative coping strategies in the absence of assistance until the 2020 harvest season.

Post-Cyclone Recovery

• WFP’s recovery and reconstruction activities began in August 2019. From August to October 2019, WFP aims to assist 400,000 beneficiaries in Sofala, 100,000 in Manica and 67,000 in Cabo Delgado through Food Assistance for Assets (FFA) activities. The most vulnerable groups, however, including internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the north, will continue to receive unconditional food assistance. The main objectives of the intervention are to meet the immediate food needs of targeted populations, while supporting the creation and rehabilitation of community assets. These interventions aim to enable recovery of affected communities while reducing household vulnerability to shocks, which in turn will contribute to future resiliencestrengthening efforts.

• WFP will deliver value vouchers, commodity vouchers and in-kind assistance during the recovery phase. From November, the scale of recovery interventions will be increased and extended to cover Tete and Zambezia provinces, in order to meet immediate food needs of populations until the next harvest season in March 2020. According to the IPC findings of July 2019, 1.9 million people are at risk of food insecurity during the lean season, until March 2020. During the second phase of the recovery operation (November 2019 to March 2020), WFP plans to assist 1 million people.

Drought Response

• WFP aims to implement a drought-focused FFA programme from November to March. The programme will be implemented in the three southern provinces of Mozambique (Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane) to cover the immediate food needs of drought-affected communities, while supporting the creation and rehabilitation of community assets. As part of this programme, WFP plans to assist a total of 225,000 food insecure people.",2019-10-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'brief', '2019', 'wfp', 'food', 'assistance', 'provinces', 'recovery', '2020', 'million', 'country', 'phase', 'season']",Mozambique,news article,English

Enlarge this image toggle caption Amy E. Robertson for NPR Amy E. Robertson for NPR

Koshary is to Egyptian cuisine as the pyramids are to its culture. Emblematic. Iconic. Beloved.

Also spelled koshari or kushari (those pesky transliterations from Arabic script!), it is widely considered Egypt's national dish. Rice, lentils (black or brown), chickpeas and pasta are cooked individually, then tossed together and topped with cumin-scented tomato sauce and crunchy fried onions. Things get kicked up a notch with condiments of garlicky vinegar and a peppery hot sauce called shatta. Heavily laden with carbs and calories, a plate of koshary fills up even the hungriest of stomachs for just a few Egyptian pounds.

Notwithstanding its enormous popularity, koshary is a relatively recent invention of this ancient civilization.

""I had never eaten or known of koshary in Egypt before 1952, when I went to school in Paris,"" says Claudia Roden, an award-winning cookbook author and food historian who was born and raised in Cairo. ""No one ever mentioned the recipe when I was researching my first book almost sixty years ago. Other people, who like me left Egypt in the fifties, have also told me that they did not remember it. Of course, it might have been sold in some quarter of Cairo that that I never went to.""

Its cousin, mujaddara, made of rice, lentils and fried onions, has long roots in Arab culture, and Roden guesses that koshary evolved from that culinary classic. She adds, ""It's possible that the addition of short macaroni is an Italian influence.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Amy E. Robertson for NPR Amy E. Robertson for NPR

Pasta is called maacarona in Egyptian Arabic, which at first glance lends credence to the theory that the Italians brought their macaroni to the dish. ""On the other hand,"" Roden points out, ""pasta is an Arab thing mentioned in medieval culinary manuscripts.""

It may be a question of the chicken and the egg.

While no one can say for sure where koshary came from, everyone has an opinion on where to eat it. For Ahmed Hameed, it's at his mom's. But as a private tour guide in Cairo, he has found that the famed Koshary Abou Tarek restaurant makes a fine substitute.

""Koshary is a hard meal to cook as it consists of several elements, each of which should prepared separately,"" says Hameed. ""It's one of the most traditional meals in Egypt, and food in general is an experience that you shouldn't miss while traveling. The recipe is a secret formula that can be different from one restaurant to another. Abou Tarek has his own recipe.""

From the locals thronging the restaurant for both sit-down and take-away, it's clear that Hameed is not the only one who favors Abou Tarek's. Cook staff are lined up behind a long counter, dishing up plates and take-away packages at a breakneck pace. What started as a food cart in 1950 is now a bustling, four-story restaurant. Foreigners are led to the top floor, where English-speaking waiters are on staff and an oversized portrait of Abou Tarek smiles down on customers. Portions are generous, and prices range from about 50 cents for a small bowl to a dollar and change for a large. Tucked away on a narrow side street just a couple of blocks from the Egyptian Museum, Koshary Abou Tarek is a convenient pit stop during a day of sight-seeing.

Ali Zayed, an Egyptian living and working in Lebanon since 2003, makes sure to tell his Lebanese friends to try koshary when they travel to Egypt. ""I miss koshary when I am in Lebanon,"" he says. ""I eat it two or three times a month when I visit Egypt."" But while ""mama"" makes a tasty koshary, Zayed confesses that he prefers to eat it out. ""I like to eat it outside the home and when I'm alone, because I put too much hot sauce and...."" Zayed puffs out his cheeks and fans his face to demonstrate the perils of adding a lot of spice. He adds, ""If I am going to be out all day, koshary is the No. 1 food I want to eat.""

Not every koshary joint is as elaborate as Abou Tarek's. Many are hole-in-the-wall eateries and others are simple food carts. Guys on bicycles deliver individual portions of it around town, even famously pulling up in Tahrir Square in 2012 to feed hungry protesters.

""I was surprised to find it everywhere when I went back after 32 years,"" Roden says. ""I love it and make it myself. When I visit now I always eat it.""",2017-02-22 08:00:00+00:00,"['tarek', 'modern', 'cuisine', 'egyptian', 'egypt', 'food', 'mystery', 'amy', 'roden', 'abou', 'eat', 'koshary', 'egypts', 'robertson', 'beloved', 'ancient']",Egypt,news article,English

The death toll in Sundayâ??s flash flooding in a national park in Kenya has increased to six and rescue teams are still looking for one tourist, Kenyaâ??s Wildlife Service said on Monday.

The tour group of seven people â?? five Kenyans, a local tourist guide and a â??non-resident foreignerâ? â?? had been caught in the flash flood Sunday in Hellâ??s Gate National Park.

â??Six bodies of the flash flood victims have been recovered, leaving one tourist missing. The search and rescue operation continues as we reach out to next of kin to share details of sad incident and plan together next course of action,â? KWS on its official Twitter page.

Search and rescue teams had initially recovered two bodies on Sunday but four more were found as efforts continued throughout the night, KWS said.

A helicopter was dispatched from the capital Nairobi, which is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the park, to help with search efforts on Sunday

The gorge in the popular park was closed Sunday following the incident, according to the agency which said that tour groups were usually accompanied by guides, who are trained to detect storm water flowing down from the gorge and alert visitors to impending danger.

â??Since the last similar tragedy in 2012, we have created clearly marked emergency exists along the whole gorge as escape routes in case of danger like the flash floods,â? KWS said Monday.

At least seven members of a church group were killed in a flash flooding while walking on a gorge in the park in 2012.

Hellâ??s Gate is a popular hiking and cycling spot for tourists and locals and is known for its towering cliffs and gorges carved by a prehistoric lake.

The producers of ""The Hobbit"" movies on Tuesday rejected allegations that animals died due to mistreatment during the making of Peter Jackson's highly anticipated Tolkien trilogy in New Zealand.

A giant Gollum creature from ""The ""Hobbit"" movie catches a fish on the ceiling of Wellington airport on October 31, 2012. The producers of ""The Hobbit"" movies have rejected allegations from animal rights group PETA that animals have died during the making of the highly anticipated Tolkien trilogy in New Zealand.

Animal rights group PETA said up to 27 animals, including horses, sheep, goats and chickens, died during filming, prompting it to plan protests against the movies, the first of which has its world premiere in Wellington next week.

Jackson and the producers said in a statement that the American Humane Association monitored all use of animals during the shoot and ""no animals died or were harmed on set during filming"".

""The producers completely reject the accusations that 27 animals died due to mistreatment during the making of the films,"" the statement said.

""Extraordinary measures were taken to make sure that animals were not used during action sequences or any other sequence that might create undue stress for the animals involved.""

It added that 55 percent of shots featuring animals in the three films, which were shot back-to-back with a budget estimated at US$500 million, were computer-generated.

PETA said most of the allegations it was raising did not occur on set while cameras were rolling, but at farms and stables where the animals were housed.

It said some wranglers involved in the project -- who the producers said had been sacked more than a year ago -- reported two horses died from broken necks after being forced off steep embankments by other animals in their paddocks.

PETA US senior vice president Lisa Lange said sheep and goats died from worms and after falling into sinkholes in rugged terrain, and a dozen chickens were mauled to death by dogs.

""This production's decision to use numerous live animals and allow them to suffer needlessly takes the entertainment industry a giant and disgraceful step backwards,"" she said in a statement.

PETA spokeswoman Claire Fryer alleged that during a location shoot a misbehaving horse was left on the ground for three hours with its legs tied together, suffering rope burns that were covered with make-up during filming.

The first of the three movies, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", premieres in Wellington on November 28 and will be released worldwide in December.

PETA said it would protest at the event and at premieres in the United States and Britain.

""It's important that movie-goers are made aware of this,"" Fryer told AFP.

The producers said they took animal welfare seriously and had pursued the highest level of care for those used in the films.

""We regret that some of these accusations by wranglers who were dismissed from the film over a year ago are only now being brought to our attention,"" they said.",2012-11-20 08:00:00+00:00,"['animals', 'allegations', 'wellington', 'making', 'cruelty', 'animal', 'died', 'movies', 'wranglers', 'deny', 'producers', 'hobbit']",India,news article,English

The death toll in Bihar and Assam floods mounted to 174, with a total of 1.09 crore people being affected by the calamity in the two states, officials said.

Though water levels have started receding in several districts of the two states, both reported two deaths each since Monday.

With both the casualties taking place in Madhubani district of Bihar, the toll in the state reached 106. In Assam, the number of deaths touched 68 as two more people died in Morigaon and Golaghat districts since Monday.

A total of 28.01 lakh people were affected in 19 of the 33 districts of the northeastern state, officials said in Guwahati.

Though the flood waters have receded in Biswanath and Karbi Anglong districts, the deluge hit Lakhimpur and Baksa again, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said.

In the Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat district the death toll of animals rose to 204, including 15 rhinos, since July 13, it said.

In Bihar, water levels have started receding in several districts and consequently the number of relief camps and those taking shelter at these have also gone down considerably, Disaster Management Department officials said

A population of 80.55 lakh in 12 districts are still affected in the state.

The number of relief camps on Tuesday was 54, as against more than 130 a week ago and the number of people staying at those places has gone down from over one lakh to

1308,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flood-proofing for Canada's national building code gets U.S. expert's advice - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/flood-proofing-national-building-code-expert-1.5330584,"Canada's national building code has guidelines for how to construct homes to defend against wind, snow, rain and earthquakes — but not floods.

That could soon change.

The National Research Council (NRC) is working on potential changes to the National Building Code of Canada that would include information on how to flood-proof buildings.

""That's a pretty difficult problem to wrap your arms around,"" said Bill Coulbourne, president of Coulbourne Consulting, of Annapolis, Md., the team hired by the NRC to help with the building code update.

Coulbourne and his team are ""uniquely qualified to carry our this work due to their extensive experience (140 years combined) in the design of flood resistant buildings,"" said an email statement from Nic Defalco, communications adviser with the NRC.

Coulbourne Consulting will be paid $564,057 for its expertise.

In Canada, building construction falls under provincial jurisdiction, but the federal government publishes and updates the National Building Code to provide a baseline starting point.

Six provinces have accepted the national code as is. Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec use the code, but with some variations.

This year thousands of Canadians were affected by floods.

Residents along the Ottawa River were forced to evacuate their homes when water levels rose to record levels in May. The month before, the Saint John River flooded homes throughout New Brunswick. In July, hay crops in British Columbia were destroyed when the Chilcotin River burst its banks.

The Canadian government says the frequency and severity of flooding will likely increase in the years ahead.

Canadian basements

Coulbourne Consulting has helped governments in the United States craft codes to build flood-resistant structures. But Canada's code needs to be tailor-made.

""In the U.S., one of the prohibitions when you're building in a flood plain is that you cannot build a basement,"" Coulbourne said.

""In Canada, colder temperatures mean deeper foundations for buildings. You pretty much [always] have a basement.""

Hundreds of homes in Windsor, Ont., and Tecumseh, Ont., had their basements flooded after storms pummelled the region in 2017. (Jason Viau/CBC)

For homes built alongside bodies of water, Coulbourne suggests assuming that a basement will flood on a semi-regular basis and to plan accordingly.

That would mean using a basement for storage boxes that could be easily moved upstairs when floodwaters rise.

""[It means] keeping the basement in place but using it as a place to collect water when it floods,"" he said. ""That's not a popular thing to do, as you can imagine. In some cases, that might be half their living space.""

Water more powerful than wind

For newer construction, keeping floodwaters out of basements is possible but challenging.

""The force of water is usually a lot higher than the load transferred into buildings from high winds and earthquakes,"" said Coulbourne. ""So water can actually exert quite a force on something like a building wall.""

The flooded Muskoka River submerges a front-yard flagpole in Bracebridge, Ont., earlier this year. (Jean-Francois Morissette/CBC)

If the structure is built strong enough to withstand the force of the water, the next step is sealing every entrance.

""The effort in flood-proofing a building is really to search for all those places that water could penetrate the building and figure out how to seal them up,"" Coulbourne said.

Providing guidance, not writing policies

Coulbourne says his team is not telling the Canadian government exactly what its code should be.

""I don't think that's our place. We are going to stay out of the policy conversation as much as we can,"" he said.

""We are working on reports and guidance documents that would provide the NRC with information about what to use and how to consider the current information that's available in Canada.""

The NRC says the reports and analysis from Coulbourne Consulting ""will be provided to codes committees for consideration in future editions of building codes, standards and guides.""

1729,FL-2021-000038-KEN,109-year-old Dottie Ball dies - Uckfield News,https://uckfieldnews.com/109-year-old-dottie-ball-dies/,"A service of celebration and thanksgiving is due to be held on Thursday for the life of 109-year-old Dorothy Ball. She was recently listed as the 21st oldest person in the UK.

Dottie, as she was known, was born on October 5, 1911, in London, but her family later moved to Yorkshire where she met her husband John.

After the end of World War 2 the couple went to East Africa as missionaries, spending ten years in Tanzania and 16 years in Kenya. They spent their retirement years in Seaford.

Home-maker

Daughter Glenys Dean said that her mother was a home-maker, loved having visitors, was a needlewoman, wonderful cook and gardener. She had many stories to tell about life in Africa.

Dottie was 106 when she went into Temple Grove care home at Herons Ghyll, near Uckfield.

Glenys said: “She received care second to none from wonderful nurses/carers. We could not have chosen a better place for her to spend the last years of her very long life.”

Dottie was totally unaware of the pandemic and she was able to receive occasional visits from her family outside periods of lockdown.

Cards from the Queen

Glenys was with her as she celebrated her 109th birthday when she received her sixth card from the Queen. Dottie had received them previously when she was 100, 105, 106, 107 and 108.

Glenys said that she and her brother Stephen grew up in Africa. She remembered the excitement of food being delivered in boxes once a month.

There was no running water, no electricity – and there was always the possibility of arriving home to find a leopard sitting on the veranda.

Trips to the outside loo were terrifying because you never knew whether a snake was going to drop in.

‘Mrs Practical’

Glenys said Dottie was ‘Mrs Practical’. She needed to be resourceful because John spent a lot of time away travelling. She made the children’s clothes while John made some of their toys.

“We didn’t think anything of it then, of course,” said Glenys. “That was just what life was like, but I do remember when we came home Stephen was amazed to turn a light on at the flick of a switch.”

One of the things John did while in Kenya was set up a training college for the Church Army. It is now called Carlile College and, from very small beginnings has grown exponentially over the years.

Dottie died peacefully at Temple Grove on March 31, and a service of celebration and thanksgiving for her life is to be held on Thursday, April 22, at All Saints Church, Crowborough.

By Rehab Abd Almohsen

[CAIRO] Egypt’s Nile river water supply will only be threatened by the filling of the upstream Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in the case of prolonged drought, new analysis suggests.

The dam, and ongoing negotiations over its filling and future operation, has sparked conflict between Ethiopia and downstream states Sudan and Egypt, which say they fear the giant Blue Nile hydropower dam could alternately cause water scarcity and flooding in their countries.

Data analysis shows that Egypt will not be severely affected by the first stage of the filling of the dam, says Peter Hany, a professor of irrigation and hydraulics at Egypt’s Ain Shams University.

“In the case of an abundance of water, or a sudden flood that necessitates the release of large quantities of water, it is possible that the Sudanese dams will not bear this pressure and collapse.” Mohamed Dawoud, National Center for Water Research in Egypt

However, a decline of five billion cubic metres in Egypt's share of Nile river waters — about 12.5 per cent of what Egypt says is its minimum need — could lead to the loss of 42,000 hectares of agricultural land, Hany warns.

Recent heavy rains mean the first stage of filling is already complete, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister said after an extraordinary meeting between the three states last week (21 July).

Sudan reported last week that it had recorded a significant drop in water levels along its sections of the Nile.

The African Union called the summit in an effort to progress stalled political, legal and technical negotiations and arrive at a comprehensive operational agreement for the dam.

Hany says beginning the filling process this year, rather than next year, was the better option as water levels are currently high in Egypt’s Lake Nasser, which fills from the Nile and provides water for agriculture and energy production.

A seven-year filling schedule had been tentatively agreed as a result of a series of negotiations that began in December, but Ethiopia has been pushing for a four-year schedule to expedite its energy production.

Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s water, irrigation and energy minister, has said the release of water will remain above the historical 29 billion cubic metre flow. Egypt wants Ethiopia to commit to a minimum 40 billion cubic metres of water.

“By following this schedule, the possible range of water release is between 31 and 43 billion cubic meters during the seven years, at 80 per cent probability,” Bekele told a virtual seminar held by the Ethiopian Embassy in South Africa on June 27.

“The schedule clearly shows for the first time the filling pattern, which includes six stages, the last of which is estimated at 14 billion cubic meters,” Hany tells SciDev.Net.

Hany used this data to create a mathematical model to determine the impact that filling Ethiopia’s reservoir would have on Egypt’s Aswan High Dam and the water level in its reservoir, Lake Nasser.

Hany found that if the schedule is maintained, the impact during filling would be limited, except in the event of periods of prolonged drought.

The Nile river states agreed at the extraordinary meeting to separate scientific and technical negotiations from the political and legal issues. Dates are yet to be set for future meetings, which will be hosted by the African Union.

Also downriver from the hydropower structure, Sudan has said it fears Ethiopia’s dam will impact its own hydroelectric installations. The Nile river countries have constructed a series of dams along its length — known as cascading dams or reservoirs — and river flow fluctuations caused by upstream dams can have major implications for downstream dams.

Sudan’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Yasir Abbas, has said he feared a lack of coordination and data exchange from Ethiopia.

Mohamed Dawoud, a professor of water resources at the National Center for Water Research in Egypt, says that in the absence of a binding agreement, Sudan’s dams are at risk of being severely harmed.

The Sudanese dams are relatively small,"" Dawoud tells SciDev.Net. ""In the case of an abundance of water, or a sudden flood that necessitates the release of large quantities of water, it is possible that the Sudanese dams will not bear this pressure and collapse.""

Environmental conflict expert Ashok Swain, from Uppsala University’s Research School of International Water Cooperation, says the African Union is best placed to play the role of mediator in Nile negotiations.

“Any agreement is better than no agreement, as no one is expecting a comprehensive basin-based water resource development agreement taking place among the three riparian countries soon,” Swain says.",2020-07-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['egypt', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'dams', 'nile', 'limited', 'drought', 'cubic', 'egypts', 'dam', 'schedule', 'impact', 'river', 'filling']",Egypt,news article,English
1507,FL-2020-000164-IND,A “Himalayan Challenge” for Assam - Northeast Now,https://nenow.in/opinion/a-himalayan-challenge-for-assam.html,"Rocky Orang (24), Rajkumar Tanti (30) and Lohro Orang (48) of Dighaltarang Tea Estate under Doomdooma circle in Assam’s Tinsukia district went fishing with five others in the Dangori River on June 26. But their boat capsized and the three were washed away by the surging waters.

Reports of two youths–Bishnu Tanti and Iliyas Khal of Bisakupi Tea Estate washed away by the surging waters of the Dangori River came the next day taking the overall flood fatality in the State to 23. Flood waters also washed away the bridge that connects Doomdooma to Baghjan where a massive fire broke out after a 14-day uncontrollable oil leak from a damaged oil well at OIL’s production well site.

The washed away bridge made the operations more complicated to bring the fire under control. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal took stock of the situation and asked the deputy commissioner, Tinsukia to lay one Bailey bridge to ensure unhindered movement of vehicles engaged in emergency services.

On Monday, reports of dead fish and other aquatic birds and animals floating on the Maguri-Motapung beel created panic among local people.

Irawati Narah’s family performed the last rites of the deceased woman in a boat as no high ground was in sight in the Chabua Revenue Circle of Dibrugarh district. The Dibru and the Dangori rivers are in high spate while the Brahmaputra, flowing a little distance away creating flood fury from Sadiya to Dhubri. The flood situation in Dibrugarh spread to 120 villages besides inundating most of city of Dibrugarh.

In Tinsukia, over 60,000 people from 140 villages of the district had been severely affected. More than 50 relief camps were set up in the district. For some 1,800 families– evacuated after the blow-out and staying at the dozen–odd relief camps of Baghjan and Dighaltarang—things become more complicated as flood waters inundated relief shelters.

“It has become an ordeal to even use the toilets. With living conditions worsening inside the make-shift relief camps, how can you think of social distancing?” asked one of the inmates of a relief camp at Guijan. Altogether 640 of families from greater Natun Gaon area were forced to take shelter in two schools at Guijan as an aftermath of the inferno at Baghjan.

The second surge of flood devours most of Assam’s flood-prone districts amid community transmission of COVID-19 cases. An alarmed administration grappling dual surges of a severe flood and more severe COVID-19 spread have developed an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for relief camps which has been distributed to every district so as to deal with the Covid-19 situation as the number of positive cases show an upward swing. The Chief Executive Officer of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), MS Manivannan, assured that they are well-prepared to take on this dual challenge.

At least 200 relief camps were set up across the state where some 30,000 people had taken shelter, said an ASDMA release. To deal with the challenge of COVID-19 from spreading in the relief camps, ASDMA has drawn up standard operating protocol that defines the capacity of each camp so that people are not pushed to more vulnerability. As many of the flood-hit districts have quarantine camps, any suspected COVID-19 case in a flood relief camp would be sent to the nearest quarantine centre, stated the guidelines.

A “Himalayan Challenge” for Assam

The Assam government geared up arrangements for return of most people who were stuck outside the state and their quarantine facilities before June 10 so that the state could shift its focus to flood preparations. On May 3, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma during an interactive session with senior journalists said that the state authorities has been dealing with a Himalayan problem because it has to organize tackling flood in the course of the monsoon season and the outbreak of the Japanese encephalitis, while controlling the COVID-19 spread.

“By August 15, Assam typically witnesses flood and Japanese encephalitis, and so, the state is dealing with a “Himalayan challenge”, said Sarma.

But by the last week of May the season’s first flood, triggered by cyclone Amphan, wreaked havoc in the state. Nearly three lakh people in nine districts of the state had been severely hit.

With floods, cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) had also been reported from some districts of Assam. The Mission Director of National Health Mission (NHM) in Assam confirmed three cases of JE and 79 cases of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) from the districts of Cachar, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur, Kamrup, and Morigaon. So far, there have been no deaths. Assam reported 154 deaths from JE last year. The combined number of deaths due to JE and AES last year was 600.

After an initial low count of COVID-19 cases when the lockdown started, Assam has seen a spike in the numbers with eased travel restrictions and more people returning home. On an average, the State is now getting around 250 positive cases every day, and half of them are from Guwahati.

The State government has enforced a complete lockdown in Kamrup Metro district for 14 days from Sunday night as well as impose night curfew from 7 pm to 7 am across the State from Saturday and weekend lockdowns in towns and municipal areas till the COVID-19 situation improves. Only pharmacies and hospitals will operate during the 14-day lockdown in the city besides a few emergency services. “We have been forced to take the tough decision and we are taking it with lot of pain. We are left with no other option,” said the health minister.

Rains and dam induced devastation

Heavy monsoon rains lashed India’s Northeast since the third week of June. Incessant rainfall and release of dam water further worsened the flood situation in Assam impacting about half a million people in 1, 289 villages in 61 revenue circles of 21 districts. Hundreds of thousands were displaced from their homes. State authorities warn of a worsening situation with prediction of more rainfall.

Dhemaji is the worst-hit with four deaths and more than 200 villages affected, followed by Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Majuli. Ferry services to Majuli have been suspended.

The floodwaters also took a heavy toll on livestock. More than 70,000 livestock have so far been affected over 40,000 hectares of crop area have been submerged states ASDMA bulletin.

The second wave of flood inundated much of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in Mayong Revenue Circle in Morigaon district. The Kaziranga National Park, the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, Manas National Park, Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park and Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary were inundated by the recent wave of flood.

The flood situation worsened with neighbouring Bhutan releasing over 2700 cumecs of excess water from Kurichu dam, about 30km from Barpeta Road in lower Assam on Thursday that led to the swelling of Beki, Manas, Pagladia, Kaldia and Pohumara rivers, affecting lower Assam districts.

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal taking stock of the prevailing flood situation directed the different district administrations to keep constant vigil over the water level in their respective districts, especially in the wake of reported release of water from Bhutan.

Last year, the minister of state for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria informed the Lok Sabha that Assam has nine of the 39 most flood-prone districts in the country and Dhubri tops this list. The minister was referring to a report submitted by a committee headed by the Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC) while answering to a question by Dhubri MP Badruddin Ajmal.

According to the report, the nine most flood-prone districts of Assam are Dhubri, Lakhimpur, Morigaon, Dhemaji, Barpeta, Jorhat, Goalpara, Sivasagar and Nalbari.

Breach at Subansiri dam site create panic

Reports of damage of infrastructure and breaches in embankments poured in from different places. Although the State chief minister had, on April 30, directed the water resources department to complete all repair work on weak and breached embankments before the onset of monsoon the annual job of repairing river embankments came to a halt with the country-wide lockdown on March 25. Resentment grew along the banks against the administration for in-complete projects of embankment repair, maintenance and also anti-erosion work.

Floods and river-bank erosion pose a grave risk for the entire Brahmaputra valley. Globally, the Brahmaputra river system is perhaps the only one known for its loss of about 100 square kilometres of land every year due to bank erosion.

On May 26 part of a guard wall of the 2000 MW Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project (SLHP) breached. Moreover, erosion at the dam site created panic and riparian anxiety as a coffer dam was washed away. The NHPC authorities issued a clarification on local newspapers on Sunday stating that breach of downstream coffer dam and river flowing above the dam during monsoon is a normal event.

The clarification also stated that slope failure in diversion channel along left bank road is due to prolonged flow of water in diversion structures and is in no way related to the safety of the dam. The slopes shall be repaired after monsoons during the balance construction period after which the Diversion Tunnels shall be plugged. Earlier, the NHPC stated that the erosion site was 500 metres away from the main dam and would not make any impact.

The recent events led to protests by various organizations reiterating the apprehensions expressed by experts on the selected site for the mega-dam of the present dimension which is sensitive geologically and seismologically.

The Assam State Action Plan on Climate Change (2015-2020), states that climate change plays a major role as seen in the recent patterns in flooding in Assam. From April to late September—the state witness number of surges that would cripple the state’s economy each time. Further, thoughtless construction of dams on rivers in the name of flood control and the careless operation of dams have converted floods into a disaster.",2020-06-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['relief', 'flood', 'challenge', 'himalayan', 'districts', 'state', 'dam', 'cases', 'assam', 'covid19', 'situation', 'district']",India,news article,English

As of 10 October, flooding has affected around 2.1 million people in West and Central Africa, with many regions recording excess rainfalls. The impact in 2020 is particularly severe, and the number of people affected already is almost double last years, when floods affected 1.1 million people in 11 countries. While seasonal rains are gradually subsiding in parts of West Africa, notably the Sahel, recent flooding has occurred in Ghana, Benin and the DRC and rains will continue to affect coastal countries and Central Africa.

Resulting destruction of houses, goods, crops and fields, and land degradation are threatening the livelihoods of communities whose majority rely on agriculture. The impact of additional shocks of extreme weather events pushes vulnerable families deep into crisis. Many of the affected regions are already struggling with insecurity, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, and climate change. Floods also risk increasing the incidence of water-borne diseases, impact hygiene and sanitation, and reduce the capacity to put in place effective preventative measures against COVID-19.

National and local authorities are leading the response, including Civil Protection and Disaster Management Agencies, national Red Cross societies and NGOs, as well as community-based organisations. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated US$5 million to Niger, and ECHO supports the flood response in 8 countries in the region with a total amount of $2.7 million.

World Vision is concerned about the health, safety and protection of children, with UN food agencies estimating a record 45 million people living in 16 countries across the region will experience food shortages within six months. Climate change and more rapidly repeating, severe drought cycles are trapping people in a vicious cycle of poverty.

“It’s difficult to comprehend the number of people caught up in this terrible crisis. But if you took the average height of the girls, boys and adults trying to survive, then this line of the hungry people would stretch for 67,725 kilometres. That is more than one and a half times around the earth (40,075 km),” explained World Vision Southern Africa Hunger Emergency Response Director, Maxwell Sibhensana.

“This crisis is almost invisible to the public but on the ground we are witnessing the devastating effects of changing weather patterns that are creating unbearable situations for children. We know many children have been separated from families, are forced out of school and working to afford their next meal.”

Southern Africa’s drought has sparked critical food, nutrition and water insecurity. In technical terms, the number of people experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4) has risen from nine to 11 million across nine countries in Southern Africa. Approximately half of those the worst impacted areas are children, who are at risk of hunger, disease, exploitation and death.

Parts of the region like Angola and Zimbabwe have experienced recurrent drought in recent years, causing failed harvests. In other areas, such as Mozambique, erratic floods and cyclones damaged 700,000 hectares of crops.

“We are having to factor climate change into our development programmes, anticipating the worst and helping farmers become more resilient to climate shocks, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts many Southern African countries will be among the most affected by climate change,” said Mr Sibhensana.

In Angola, more than 2.4 million people are affected, with an estimated 85,000 children experiencing severe or moderate acute malnutrition. World Vision screening data shows that malnutrition levels in Huila province have double compared to last year, currently at more than 20 per cent.

In Zimbabwe, 5.5 million people are facing hunger, with one in three people in major cities like Harare in need of humanitarian assistance. The cost of basic commodities has tripled as the country faces inflation and an economic crisis. The country’s staple crop, maize, is reported to run out in January.

In Zambia, more than 2.3 million people are estimated to be facing acute hunger due to devastating effects of erratic rains, dry spells, water logging, false and late starts to the 2018/2019 rain season on agriculture production.

World Vision Angola Humanitarian Emergencies Director, Robert Bulten, says the situation in Angola has been deteriorating for months and called for urgent humanitarian support.

“Children are barely eating one meal a day. Our staff, who worked in Angola just after the Civil War say they have never seen hunger and malnutrition on this scale,” said Mr Bulten.

“Even if the rains arrive soon, it would be months before worst-hit farmers can harvest,” said Mr Bulten.

World Vision is responding to the hunger emergency across seven countries –Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Mozambique.

In Mozambique, drought, two cyclones and violence in the north have left 1.65 million people severely food insecure, while in Zambia, 1.7 million people are severely food insecure following erratic rains, dry spells, water logging, and false and late starts to the 2018/2019 rainy season. In Eswatini and Lesotho, nearly a quarter of the rural population face Crisis or Emergency food insecurity, while in Angola the drought is having severe consequences, particulary for children. Across the region, drought and floods have increased the likelihood of communicable disease outbreaks. In 2019, there have been cholera outbreaks in Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Measles outbreaks are ongoing in Angola, the Comoros and Madagascar, and there are outbreaks of hepatitis E in Namibia, dengue fever in Mauritius and Tanzania, and vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in Angola.

652,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Talk yourself right into a job - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/talk-yourself-right-job,"Talk yourself right into a job

I’m sure you’ve heard the expression used to describe people who can work a room: They have “the gift of gab.” The people we describe that way seem to have been born with the ability to converse. They move comfortably through crowds at social events, going from conversation to conversation with what appears to be the greatest of ease.

Luckily for most of us, that kind of outgoing nature is not necessary for job search success. Yes, communication is crucial. But unlike the innate gift of gab, you can develop the career communication skills you need. With attention, practice, and some self-awareness, you’ll be in good shape to make your communication skills work for you at various steps throughout your job search and career development path.

Reach out and listen

Industry careers are so different from academia that I think of that world as being in a parallel universe. Sure, it looks much the same. There’s the lab bench, and people are doing science. But, just as in those science fiction movies, all the rules have subtle but important differences. And it’s important to learn as much as possible about this new universe of jobs before trying to become a part of it. Doing so requires that you talk to people—and, even more importantly, that you listen.

Most conversations are 50-50. If you and I sit down to talk sports over a beer, we’re going to each spend about half the time talking up our own team. But when you open up a conversation with someone on the far side of a parallel universe, you’re in the listening zone. This isn’t the time for some kind of sales pitch about how great you are—or questions about whether there are openings at their company. Instead, focus on the fact that you want to learn what their world is all about: how companies grow, how and why they hire, what your contact’s job is like, and how she or he managed to land it in the first place. The most helpful kind of information can be found via a serious sit-down, typically referred to as an informational interview.

Being a good listener doesn’t mean that you don’t talk about yourself at all. You still want to communicate that you would be a good potential hire or network contact. But the latest thinking is that the frequently referenced “elevator pitch” is too one-sided and doesn’t offer enough space for conversation to develop. (We should probably take that word “pitch” and erase it from our job search lexicon, leaving it completely to vendors and insurance salespeople.) Today, you might instead add to the conversation by interjecting short nuggets of rehearsed language about your key skills and abilities, as well as other personal information.

I can’t tell you which of your strengths you should highlight in this way, but the Challenge-Approach-Results exercise is a good way to remind yourself of what they are and how they’ve worked to your advantage. This easy process will remind you how important it is to talk about your skills and accomplishments in succinct language to emphasize the value that you offer.

Make yourself a candidate

When people talk about the job search, “applicant” and “candidate” are often thrown around interchangeably. But there’s a difference. In hiring manager parlance, an employer can have hundreds of applicants for a job, but there are probably only a handful of them who are actually candidates. And one of the ways to elevate yourself from applicant to candidate status is—you guessed it—communication.

Applicants are often treated as if they are a dime a dozen. They come in swarms off the internet via online job applications. A job is posted on Thursday afternoon and—wham!—300 applicants by Monday morning. Sadly, employers can mistreat applicants because there are so many of them. Job ads can list 10 requirements—which may not actually be crucial for performing the role—in an attempt to thin the herd. Or, applicants can be required to fill out stupid questions on an online application. (“What is your expected salary here at ABC Biotech?”) But with candidates—that short list of people who are actually a good fit for the role and will move forward in the interview process—companies make an effort to ensure that they don’t lose even one of them along the way.

A few applicants may turn into candidates. But the best way to set yourself up as a candidate instead of an applicant is by getting an internal referral. To the human resources executive tasked with sorting through the pool of job seekers, it’s a relief to have some that come pre-approved, ready to be interviewed by a hiring manager.

Wouldn’t you rather be positioned as a candidate, as opposed to being a part of the swarm? If that’s the case, get out there and talk to people at the companies you’re interested in. Even if you’re not in job search mode yet, starting this process will help you begin to see which industry jobs might be a good fit for you so that you can build your network and, when the time is right, target jobs.

Two big opportunities on interview day

If you’ve made it to interview day, first of all, congratulations! You’re a bona fide candidate. But that doesn’t mean that communication ceases to be important—quite the contrary. How you present yourself during your interview is a crucial part of how employers decide whether you’ll move on to the next round or get the offer. It’s important throughout the day, which is usually filled with meetings featuring back-and-forth exchanges aimed at uncovering the fit between the company and the prospect (you). But there are two moments that are particularly important: your first impression and when you close each of those meetings with your last impression.

The job talk is often put at the front end of the day, so you will be making a first impression on a lot of people all at once. In the front of their minds, your audience at the job talk will be reviewing the science you present—but they wouldn’t have invited anyone into an interview who doesn’t do good science. Sure, you need to present well and be prepared for tough technical questions. But much of the first impression will depend on factors other than your science. Keys to a good first impression include the sound of your voice, your confidence, and the demeanor you project—which will ideally convey the warmth and friendliness of a potentially great teammate.

So, think about all aspects of the message you are sending. Did you separate the “we”s from the “I”s when you talked about your work? (“In the Smith lab, we do trait integration into legumes. In this particular experiment, I identified the marker for drought resistance in pigeon pea and then began a marker-assisted breeding program for that trait.”) Did you reinforce the “I’m a problem solver” nature of your experience? Employing these types of tactics is not bragging; it’s completely ethical self-promotion. You should do so sparingly, but at critical moments.

Finally, the last impression you make as you walk out the door of each office is important too. The things that will make you memorable will be your smile, your eye contact, the positive and engaging way you kept the conversation going, and other aspects of your meeting that have nothing whatsoever to do with CRISPR-Cas9 or the size of your bioreactors.

Floodwaters around the giraffesâ?? home island in Lake Baringo were slowly rising for years, but in 2020, the rate of rising floodwaters increased, ""flooding lakeshore homes, businesses, and threatening the lives of the small group of Rothschildâ??s giraffe on Longicharo Island, in Ruko Community Conservancy,"" according to a Save the Giraffes Now news release.

Video released by the Northern Rangelands Trust of the final rescue showed Ngarikoni and her calf, Noelle, being tranquilized in order to be ferried to safety without causing the animals further stress.

In the footage, Ngarikoni is seen strolling through the brush as conservationists shoot her with a tranquilizer. She then gallops around as they corralled her to a safe location. Nagarikoni is then seen with a cover over her head as the crew guides her to a barge.

An aerial view shows the giraffe being ferried across the lake to another landmass nearby where she is released and gallops off into the brush once again.

Shortly after Ngarikoni was released, her calf, Noelle, was also released and is seen galloping off the barge to rejoin her mother.

""We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue,"" said David Oâ??Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now. ""With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.""

The urgency to relocate the nine giraffes was essential to preserving their species.

""Rothschildâ??s (Nubian) giraffe are a dwindling subspecies of the Northern giraffe that once roamed the entire western Rift Valley in Kenya and into Uganda. Today, fewer than 3,000 are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya,"" according to the Save the Giraffes Now organization.

The rescue effort was a collaboration among the nonprofit as well as Kenya Wildlife Service, Ruko Community Conservancy and the Northern Rangelands Trust.

""This incredible achievement involved sketching out the innovative rescue, from designing and building the barge (named ""The GiRaft"") to creating a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland for the animals,"" according to a Save the Giraffes Now news release.

Save Giraffes Now is a nonprofit organization that collaborates with over 20 giraffe conservation projects in nine African countries to save giraffes ""from extinction by supporting action-oriented projects with immediate impact.""

666,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Typical Cuban Sweet – a Symbol of the Post-Hurricane Challenge to Agriculture - Inter Press Service,http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/04/typical-cuban-sweet-a-symbol-of-the-post-hurricane-challenge-to-agriculture/,"Typical Cuban Sweet – a Symbol of the Post-Hurricane Challenge to Agriculture

BARACOA, Cuba, Apr 18 2017 (IPS) - Early in the day, when a gentle dew moistens the ground and vegetation in the mountains of eastern Cuba, street vendor Raulises Ramírez sets up his rustic stand next to the La Farola highway and displays his cone-shaped coconut sweets.

“These will maybe be the last ones… the cones will disappear, because the hurricane brought down all the coconut palms in Baracoa,” the 52-year-old private entrepreneur told IPS. He makes a living in Cuba’s oldest city selling this traditional sweet made of coconut, honey, fruits and spices, wrapped in the fibrous cone-shaped palm leaf.

“Look at all this!“ exclaimed Ramírez, pointing to the ground next to the highway littered with the trunks of coconut palm trees knocked down or bent by Hurricane Matthew, which hit Baracoa and other parts of eastern Cuba on Oct. 4-5, 2016.

He expects to continue making his sweets for a while longer thanks to his reserves. His main customers are Cubans who pay the equivalent of 25 cents of a dollar for each “cucurucho” or coconut cone, a typical sweet of this municipality, with an agricultural sector based on coconut and cacao, among other products.

“We have to provide the local population with support to produce staple crops and provide new sources of income, until the commercial perennial crops begin to produce.” -- Theodor Friedrich



When his coconut reserves are finished, he will have to look for a different source of income than the one that has sustained his family for the last five years. “The tourists like to buy dried fruit,” he said, referring to the growing influx of foreign visitors in the area.

Ramírez’s situation is in some way similar to that of the entire agri-food sector in this municipality with a population of 81,700, which is facing a tough challenge: recovering their main long-cycle crops that were ravaged by the strongest hurricane ever registered in the province of Guantánamo, where Baracoa is located.

“We estimate the shortest possible time for coconut production to recover is four years, while cacao will take two and a half years. But reforestation will take many more years, between 15 and 20,” said Baracoa Mayor Luis Sánchez, referring to the fundamental components of local economic development: cacao, coconut, coffee and forestry products.

In the affected territories in Guantánamo, agriculture was among the hardest-hit sectors, with 70,574 hectares damaged. According to official reports, 27 per cent of the cacao, coconut and coffee plantations and 67 per cent of the forest heritage was lost.

The hurricane damaged 35,681 hectares of the main crops in this mountainous coastal municipality. Only four per cent of the vast plantations of coconut palm trees are still standing, which were used to obtain part of the seeds vital to the recovery effort.

“In small areas on the outskirts of the city some coconut palm trees still remain on private farms and in people’s yards, which are the source of the coconuts vendors are using to make their cones, but the state-run factory is not producing any,” Rodríguez said, about the temporary disappearance of this symbol of Baracoa.

The factory, the only one that made coconut cones and distributed them in the provinces of Guantánamo, Santiago de Cuba and Holguín, is now producing tomatoes and fruit brought from other parts of the country. The cocoa industry is still active, even producing several by-products, thanks to reserves of cacao.

So far, only 3,576 hectares of forestry, coconut, coffee, cacao and fruit plantations have been recuperated, since the authorities are putting a priority on “the areas dedicated to short-cycle crops to quickly obtain food, such as vegetables and fruits for domestic consumption,” said the mayor in an exclusive interview with IPS.

“Baracoa, the cacao capital” reads an enormous poster at the entrance to this city founded 505 years ago by Spanish colonialists. Alongside coconut cone vendors like Ramírez, men and women sell big scoops of home-made dark chocolate along the La Farola highway.

Hurricane Matthew thwarted a project to create production chains based on coconut and cacao, with investments to foment cultivation of the crops and modernise the food industry in the municipality. The initiative hoped to tap into other potential sources of income, especially using coconuts.

The current production based on coconut and cacao does not cover domestic demand in this country of 11.2 million, nor demand from international tourists, who reached the record number of four million in 2016.

“Meanwhile, we have to provide the local population with support to produce staple crops and provide new sources of income, until the commercial perennial crops begin to produce,” advised Theodor Friedrich, representative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Cuba.

He told IPS that to this end, FAO is supporting several initiatives for agricultural and food production recovery in the area affected by Matthew, through two projects financed by the United Nations’ Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and FAO resources. In addition, it is awaiting the approval of a bigger third project financed by a donor.

“There is an urgent need to recover the most commercial crops, to avoid delaying this process,” said Friedrich, an agronomist who advocates the need of restoring them with resilience to future climate shocks.

“In part, these crops can be used to intersperse food crops and integrate new crops with their corresponding value chains,” he said.

In the case of the territories affected by the hurricane, and together with the local authorities, FAO promotes the proposal to plant drumstick or horseradish trees (moringa oleifera) among the perennial crops, a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree which provides a micronutrient-rich ingredient used to fortify food and animal feed, while also offering a natural fertiliser for the soil.

This initiative can strengthen small industries in the area involved in the manufacturing of fortified foods and in livestock production. “It will increase the production and availability of high value-added foods, while at the same time providing a financial income to farming families,” said the FAO representative.

The government of Baracoa also identifies another economic option for local residents.

“Tourism is the most feasible alternative, because the recovery of agriculture will take some time, even though there is a programme for agro-industrial development,” said Mayor Sánchez. “After Matthew, visits here by local and international tourists fell, but now we are experiencing a surge.”

In the area, government-run hotels and other lodgings offer at total of 275 rooms, and another 367 rooms are available in 283 private houses, where the number of rooms offered has climbed to cater to the current tourism boom.

Near Baracoa’s seafront, retiree Dolores Yamilé Selva’s hostel, which she has run since 1998, is full. She believes that there is still untapped tourism potential in the area. “The tourists that come to our town, mainly from Europe, is interested in our natural surroundings,” she told IPS.",2017-04-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['typical', 'posthurricane', 'production', 'local', 'baracoa', 'agriculture', 'cuban', 'coconut', 'food', 'sweet', 'cacao', 'challenge', 'crops', 'hurricane', 'income', 'fao', 'symbol']",Ghana,news article,English

Seventy per cent of the Kaziranga National Park and its 95 camps have been submerged in water owing to the devastating floods in Assam.

To this end, forest officers have been asked to remain on duty and their leaves stand cancelled.

Kaziranga National Park in Assam is home to the world's largest population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses. Other animals like tigers and elephants are also found in the forest.

The excessive rainfall in the state has also led to flooding on the National Highway-37, throwing the normal life out of gear. This highway starts from Sutarakandi near Karimganj in Assam and terminates at Bhali in Manipur.

The MPs of the state have demanded that the Assam floods should be declared national calamity. To this end, Assam Congress MPs protested in front of Gandhi statue in Parliament over flood situation in the state.

Meanwhile, more than 26 lakh people have been displaced from their homes and flash floods have killed at least nine in the past 72 hours.

According to the Indian Meteorology Department (IMD), there is a likelihood of more rainfall in the state in the next 48 hours.

The flood situation in Dhemaji and Lakhimpur remains the worst where most of the people have been affected. Several houses, roads and bridges have also been damaged after breach of embankments led to flooding in many areas.

The incessant rains have also affected the movement of trains in Assam and the Northeast Frontier Railway suspended train movement on the Lumding-Badarpur Hill section cutting off five states including Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya from the country's railway map till July 16.

73,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Proposed Arizona copper mine threatens ocelot and jaguar - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-ocelot-copper-mine-20140811-story.html,"A lone male ocelot has become a symbol of the conflict between conservationists and federal officials over a proposal to build an open-pit copper mine in the Santa Rita Mountains, just south of Tucson.

The discovery of the ocelot in April prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reexamine its 2013 biological opinion that the Rosemont Copper mine would not unduly harm habitat for endangered species in the area, including the only known jaguar in the United States.

The ocelot, photographed with a remote-sensor camera operated by the University of Arizona, is among a handful of the secretive, highly territorial and federally endangered cats that are the first in half a century to prowl so far north of Mexico, scientists say.

There were no ocelots documented in the Santa Ritas when the agency issued its biological opinion on the mine project, proposed by Canadian firm Augusta Resource Corp. The project is to include a 955-acre open pit, a processing plant, transmission lines, new roads and tailings facilities.

Now the agency is weighing whether to anticipate an “incidental take” of an ocelot if the mine is built and trying to determine the company’s potential liability in the event the facility is linked to the death of one of the cats.

To answer those questions, the agency must first determine if the ocelot is a vagrant or a resident and if there are females in the thorny desert region, where federal protections and cattle ranchers are credited with protecting habitat for jaguars and ocelots.

The agency is also reconsidering the potential impacts of groundwater pumping by the mine on critical habitat for the endangered Chiricahua leopard frog and two fish, the Gila chub and Gila topminnow.

Conservationists led by the Center for Biological Diversity, which is based in Tucson, about 25 miles north of the Santa Ritas, have their minds made up.

“The science is clear,” said Randy Serraglio, a spokesman for the center. “The Rosemont mine cannot coexist with jaguars, ocelots and other endangered wildlife whose survival is on the line.

“Beyond that, we may be witnessing the results of the good work the USFWS has done by making it illegal to kill jaguars and ocelots,” he said. “Why would we want to turn our backs on that?”

The project was controversial even before the ocelot showed up.

In earlier drafts of the 2013 biological opinion, agency biologists concluded that the proposed mine would destroy thousands of acres of critical habitat for the jaguar on public land and sever access to the species’ range in northern Mexico.

Steve Spangle, manager of Fish and Wildlife’s ecological services field office in Arizona, rejected his scientists’ conclusion on the grounds that the adverse impacts they predicted were “too speculative” and not “highly probable” to result from the operation.

“The ‘incidental take permit’ we gave the company was based on our conclusion that the jaguar may simply shift its home range elsewhere,” Spangle said in an interview. “We never granted permission to physically harm or kill a jaguar.

“I’m as excited as anyone else that these animals are showing up out there,” he said.

In 2009, the Arizona Game and Fish Department euthanized the last then-known jaguar in the United States after capturing and outfitting him with a radio collar. An independent investigation later determined that the jaguar’s death was due in part to mismanagement by state officials.

Kuugongelwa-Amadhila made the plea on Thursday during the president's town hall meeting in Swakopmund to assess the drought assistance and relief programme in the region.

Although she did not say how much the president and vice-president contributed, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said that Namibians do not need to contribute the 2 percent in monetary value but can contribute anything or any amount that suits their pockets.

""You requested that your leaders set an example. Hence, I would like to confirm that Cabinet is leading the way. Just as the president and the vice president, I am also in the process of doing the same, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila told residents on Thursday.

She added that government only managed to raise about N$300 million of the N$570 million that was budgeted for the drought relief programme.

""Our business partners and international friends so far donated about N$90 million to assist with the drought relief programme. Farmers in the Omaheke region also told government that although they do not have water, they have plenty of grass, which they can donate as well. That is the kind of compassion we need to have as Namibians. Government is not necessarily looking for money. It can be food items, grass (animal fodder) or any kind of donation,"" explained the Prime Minister.

Kuugongelwa-Amadhila added that government understands why the two percent contribution did not sit well with many Namibians; especially those who felt the contribution will put a dent in their meagre salaries that are already challenged in these hard economic times.

She also told residents that several civil and ordinary working Namibians have already made contributions, which government is thankful for.

""That is the solidarity. Please consider supporting this very noble initiative to help others in need. Anyone willing to donate can make arrangements to contribute in instalments or once-off. So please, let us be considerate and assist government to make a change and help our drought-stricken families and farmers,"" the Prime Minister further appealed.",2019-07-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['drought', 'president', 'namibians', 'million', 'relief', 'told', 'contribution', 'need', 'kuugongelwaamadhila', 'vp', 'namibia', 'prime', 'donate']",Ghana,news article,English

During a survey, Dawn found encroachments along graveyards whereas due to limited space, managements of graveyard committees have also been charging higher prices for new graves. All graveyards are without boundary walls and land grabbers have managed to carry out construction in their surrounding areas; the worst affected is one of the oldest graveyards of Rawalpindi whereas the Dhoke Ratta and Pirwadhai graveyards also present the same picture.

Management of the graveyards had dug new graves along the bank of the nullah passing through the area but during monsoon, flood water destroys them, creating problems for the heirs.

The Eidgah graveyard is accommodating new arrivals as the management extended limits of the graveyard along the banks of the nullah.

Racecourse graveyard in cantonment is also running out of space. The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) imposed a ban on new arrivals in the graveyard and asked that limited space be allocated for only army personnel.

Mohammad Nasir, resident of Mohanpura, said that his father died two months ago and he visited all the graveyards near his locality but they refused to bury his father. He said he talked to a grave-digger in Dhoke Illahi Buksh who managed to provide a space between two graves for his deceased father.

A resident of Chaklala Scheme III, Mudassir Malik said his brother died a few weeks ago and his family faced difficulty in finding a place to bury the deceased as there was no space available in Chaklala Scheme-III graveyard.

He said he paid Rs30,000 to the graveyard near Chungi Stop adjacent to Scheme-III. The government should allocate space for a graveyard in the city. In mid-90s, 1000 kanals of land was allocated for the purpose in Rakh Dhamial but since the last 26 years, all governments failed to develop the graveyard.

In 2017, the PML-N government had launched project Shehr-e-Khamoshan and started work to construct a funeral prayer site, mosque, ablution area and other facilities but the graveyard is still not being utilised.

On the other hand, officials of the administration said that people were not interested in burying their near and dear ones in Rakh Dhamial as it was out of the city. There is no proper transport to carry the deceased and people to attend funeral prayers.

RDA, which is responsible for metropolitan planning of the city and managing housing societies across the district has failed to force private housing societies to develop their own graveyards. Under the law, every private housing society has to allocate space for graveyard, school, college, mosque, park and roads and it has to be transferred in the name of the state.

Former PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said that the ruling party has failed to develop graveyards. We do not expect good from them as they are snatching bread from the people. How can they provide facilities? he said.

The PML-N government in its tenure developed the Rakh Dhamial graveyard but work on it was stopped by the present government just to get political revenge from PML-N.

Former PTI MPA Arif Abbasi said that development of graveyards was the governments priority. When contacted, Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) Chief officer Ali Abbas Bukhari said Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat directed to speed up work to develop Rakh Dhamial graveyard and make it functional as soon as possible.

He said that RMC purchased two funeral buses so families could transport deceased persons to the graveyard. We are providing free of cost service to citizens in the garrison city for use of funeral buses. We will purchase two more buses soon, he said, adding there is an acute shortage of graveyards in the city making burial of the dead a great problem for the bereaved families.

The picturesque Ovid winery is Silver Oak's latest acquisition.

A $50 million Napa winery sale was negotiated around the kitchen table, W. Blake Gray reports.

What does it mean, when one of Napa Valley's most popular wineries buys one of its most exclusive?

It seems like an odd fit: Silver Oak, which makes 100,000 cases of wine annually, buying Ovid, which makes about 2000.

Silver Oak's wines are not cheap: its Napa Cabernet is $125; its Alexander Valley Cab is $75. But Ovid's wines are at another price level: about $300, if you can find them.

Silver Oak is consistently in the Top 10 of Wine & Spirits' Restaurant Poll as one of the most-ordered wines in America. I think it's fair to say that relatively few Americans, even among wine drinkers, have even heard of Ovid, which didn't release its first vintage (a 2005 wine) until 2009.

Before I go into a disquisition on the meaning of the $50 million sale of such a small luxury brand, it's worth noting that often a first-generation business is sold just because the founders want to sell.

""They were just ready to move on,"" Silver Oak president and CEO David Duncan told Wine-Searcher. ""They have their own reasons. This is a friendship thing, literally decided around the kitchen table. They were really looking for the next steward of the brand.""

And how much is $50 million in the California wine business, really?

Stagecoach Vineyard with 600 acres planted on Napa's Atlas Peak, sold to Gallo just last month for just $180 million. It's 40 times as big as Ovid yet fetched only 3.6 times as much money.

For further perspective: in 2015, Constellation paid $315 million for the Meiomi brand, with no vineyards whatsoever. Which would you rather have? All of Stagecoach Vineyard, all of Ovid's vineyard and Ovid's winery, and $85 million cash – or the brand name ""Meiomi""?

For the ordinary consumer, it might be a little comforting that Meiomi and its multiple wines under $20 is worth so much more than the vineyards and wineries that create $300 wines.

Silver Oak is somewhere in between. It's too expensive to be an everyday wine of the people, but it is a wine that middle-class drinkers have on special occasions. And Duncan said there is more crossover between Silver Oak's customers and Ovid's than you might think.

""I've received dozens and dozens and dozens of emails from longtime Silver Oak clients that are also Ovid clients,"" Duncan told Wine-Searcher. ""Just because you listen to the Rolling Stones doesn't mean you don't enjoy Beethoven or Mozart. I don't see them as completely different things.""

Ovid's value was built quickly. Owners Mark Nelson and Dana Johnson made their money by building and selling a medical software company. They took their earnings and, according to a Napa Register story by L. Pierce Carson in 2011, bought the Pritchard Hill property in 1999 just because it was beautiful and they wanted to live there.

When they tried their neighbors' wine, they decided they should make some of their own. They hired a Napa dream team, in the early years of when that became the thing to do: vineyard manager David Abreu, consulting winemaker Andy Erickson and architect Howard Backen for the winery. They didn't try to build the brand with purchased fruit, instead waiting until they had estate wine to sell, nearly 10 years after they bought the property.

Their time in the wine industry has thus been relatively short: less than eight years since they first starting selling wine. Of the 19 Ovid wines reviewed by the Wine Advocate, 11 have scores of 95 or better, topped by a 99 for the 2013 Ovid Red Blend Hexameter. Even in an era when 100-point scores are commonplace, that's still quite good.

Unlike Meiomi, which now comes in Chardonnay and Rosé flavors as well as the original Pinot Noir, I wouldn't expect Ovid to expand its production or range of wines. The appeal of Ovid for wine lovers is the Pritchard Hill site and the exclusivity.

""Our job is to keep Ovid Ovid,"" Duncan said. ""There's a customer base for that price point. That's also one of the greatest pieces of property in Napa. It's just a fabulous site to grow Bordeaux varietals.""

What you might see, if Duncan chooses, is Ovid in more places.

""Silver Oak is one of the few small-to-midsize brands with enough market clout the get a new brand into the three-tier distribution system if it chooses,"" said wine industry analyst Barbara Insel, president of Stonebridge Research. ""It adds to the private client market for Ovid. Silver Oak's following is quite remarkable. No matter how much the somms complain, they will all tell you that their lists have to include Silver Oak and Rombauer because a significant group of customers demand it.""

One of the things I have always loved about Silver Oak is that it makes no special reserve wines. Sadly few of the larger wineries in Napa and Sonoma County have this policy (hello, Jordan.) This means that all the best grapes go into the main Silver Oak label. They don't get enough credit for that.

Buying Ovid allows the Duncan family to have a special reserve level without touching the quality of their main wine, which is arguably the most popular expensive wine in America. They deserve credit for that too. Perhaps $50 million was a bargain.",2017-04-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['flexes', 'wine', 'oak', 'ovid', 'purchase', 'duncan', 'muscles', 'brand', 'winery', 'napa', 'silver', 'million', 'wines']",Ghana,news article,English
1421,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Ancient mummies to parade through streets of Cairo - ABC17NEWS - ABC17News.com,https://abc17news.com/news/national-world/2021/04/02/ancient-mummies-to-parade-through-streets-of-cairo/,"National-World

Ancient mummies of Egypt’s royal pharaohs will emerge from their resting places this weekend and parade through the streets of Cairo in search of a new home.

What sounds like the plot of a movie is in fact part of a lavish celebration of Egypt’s history and a project to relocate some of its greatest treasures to a new high tech facility.

On Saturday, the mummies of Ramses the Great and 21 of his fellow pharaohs will take part in what is being billed as “The Pharaoh’s Golden Parade,” a highly anticipated event organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

It’s reported that the celebrations will include horse-drawn chariots, choirs singing in ancient languages and a plethora of movie stars and dignitaries, but Egyptian authorities have kept official details of the event under lock and key.

“It is a surprise,” Ahmed Ghoneim, executive director of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, the institution which will be the final resting place for the mummies, tells CNN.

Nevertheless, it’s hard to keep an event of this magnitude a surprise, especially when dress rehearsals recently took place in the center of Cairo. Excited Egyptians snapped photos of custom-made mummy vehicles adorned with golden ancient motifs and hastily uploaded them to social media.

The final move

The aim of the parade is to move the 18 kings and four queens of Egypt, along with their coffins and belongings, from their old home at The Egyptian Museum.

They’ll be transported five kilometers (three miles) south, to their new high-tech resting place at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC).

No, not the vast Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza which is also due to open to the public later this year. The NMEC is a completely different museum in Cairo’s Fustat neighborhood that will complete a trio of must-see Egyptian-themed museums in and around Cairo.

Although the NMEC had a partial opening in 2017, the parade will signify the grand opening.

“It’s a presidential opening,” says Ghoneim. And the completion of the Hall of Royal Mummies which looks to be a unique museum experience.

“The whole idea is not the mummies, the whole idea is how you display the mummies… It’s how you tell the story, it’s the environment, it’s the ambiance that you feel when you’re getting in,” he adds.

Ghoneim says visitors entering the Hall of Royal Mummies will experience something akin to entering a tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

All 22 royal mummies are from the New Kingdom, an era where tombs were built underground with hidden entrances to ward off grave robbers. A world apart, and about 600 years, from their flamboyant Old Kingdom royal counterparts who built colossal pyramid tombs.

Preparing the mummies

Dr. Mostafa Ismail, head of conservation at the Mummies Conservation Lab and Storeroom at the NMEC, led a team of 48 people to prepare the royal mummies.

The conservation process, he tells CNN, involves placing each mummy in an oxygen-free, nitrogen capsule “which can keep it preserved without being damaged from the effects of humidity, especially we’re talking about bacteria, fungi, and insects.”

The capsule is surrounded by soft material that distributes pressure and reduces vibrations during transportation.

When the mummies arrive at the NMEC, the display units will have the exact same conditions as the nitrogen capsules. “So there will not be any shock for the mummy when we take it from the box and put it in these units,” Ismail adds.

Accompanying each mummy will be any belongings discovered alongside them, including their coffins.

Displays will also show CT scans which reveal what is beneath the wraps, and sometimes any breaks in bones or diseases that afflicted the royals.

“The main thing that we want the visitors to know about these mummies, is how they have been mummified and preserved for a long time.”

When asked if his team discovered anything new about the mummies in preparing them for the move, Ismail remarked: “a lot of things,” but none that he would reveal before the parade. So there are more surprises to come.

A new cultural hub in Cairo

Undoubtedly the Hall of Royal Mummies will be the star attraction for visitors to The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, but Executive Director Ahmed Ghoneim hopes to position the museum differently to its neighboring institutions.

“I’m not focusing on the Pharaonic era as most people would think,” he says. “Most Egyptians and non-Egyptians, whenever they go to an Egyptian museum then they think they’re going to see the pharaohs.

“Here I’m setting myself differently, I’m telling a different story, going across history and coming to the present.”

The first temporary exhibition will focus on Egyptian textiles and fashion. “All of the history from carpets to clothing” says Ghoneim.

Through the exhibits the museum will tell a richer story of the achievements of Egyptian civilization but the museum will also be a cultural hub.

“A place that offers everything, part educational, part cultural, part amusement, part night time dining place, and so on. It’s something that’s unique.”

And at last, 3,234 years after his death, Rameses II may finally be laid to rest.

The museum will be open to the public the day after the parade, on April 4, with the Hall of Royal Mummies opening two weeks later on April 18. The Pharaoh’s Golden Parade will be streamed live on the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities’ YouTube channel.",2021-04-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['museum', 'streets', 'egyptian', 'parade', 'place', 'royal', 'hall', 'mummies', 'mummy', 'pharaohs', 'cairo', 'ancient', 'nmec']",Egypt,news article,English

WINDSOR, Australia — Kelly Miller stood in her doorway Monday, watching the water rise to within a few inches of the century-old home where she runs an alternative medicine business. The bridge nearby had already gone under in some of Australia’s worst flooding in decades, along with an abandoned car in the parking lot.“It’s coming up really quickly,” she said.Two massive storms have converged over eastern Australia, dumping more than 3 feet of rain in just five days. In a country that suffered the worst wildfires in its recorded history just a year ago, the deluge has become another record-breaker — a once-in-50-years event, or possibly 100, depending on the rain that is expected to continue through Tuesday night.Nearly 20,000 Australians have been forced to evacuate, and more than 150 schools have been closed. The storms have swept away the home of a couple on their wedding day, prompted at least 500 rescues and drowned roads from Sydney up into the state of Queensland 500 miles north.Shane Fitzsimmons, the resilience commissioner for New South Wales — a new state position formed after last year’s fires — described the event as another compounding disaster. Last year, huge fires combined into history-making infernos that scorched an area larger than many European countries. This year, thunderstorms have fused and hovered, delivering enough water to push rivers like the Hawkesbury to their highest levels since the 1960s.Scientists note that both forms of catastrophe represent Australia’s new normal. The country is one of many seeing a pattern of intensification — more extreme hot days and heat waves, as well as more extreme rainfalls over short periods.It is all tied to a warming earth, caused by greenhouse gases. Because global temperatures have risen 1.1 degrees Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, over preindustrial levels, landscapes dry out more quickly, producing severe droughts, even as more water vapor rises into the atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of extreme downpours.“There is a very strong link between global warming and that intensification in rainfall,” said Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales. “There’s good scientific evidence to say extreme rain is becoming more extreme due to global warming.”Australia’s conservative government — heavily resistant to aggressive action on climate change that might threaten the country’s fossil fuel industry — has yet to make that link.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to flee and several dozen areas have already been declared disaster zones.“It’s another testing time for our country,” he told a Sydney radio station, 2GB, on Monday.Windsor may become one of the places hardest hit. Over the weekend, the Hawkesbury rose rapidly by more than 30 feet, and it is expected to peak in the next day or so at 42 feet.With rain continuing to fall, emergency workers wearing bright orange went door to door on side streets with waist-deep puddles where the road dipped.In and around the historic downtown, many of the businesses close to the river stayed shut Monday, with a few putting sandbags by their doors. The central meeting place seemed to be at the foot of the Windsor Bridge, where television crews and crowds in rubber boots marveled at the view.The new Windsor Bridge, which opened just a few months ago as a “flood-proof” replacement for an older bridge, was completely underwater.It was built 10 feet higher than the bridge it replaced, but the river flowed over it as if it did not exist. A red flashing light on the top of a buried yellow excavator offered the only hint of the old bridge, or what had once been solid ground.Cameron Gooch, 46, a diesel mechanic from a town nearby, said he saw huge trees speeding downriver toward the coast a day earlier. The water seemed to have slowed down, he said, becoming a giant bathtub with water held in place and rising slowly from tributaries.“That’s the problem,” he said. “It’s just going to keep building up.”

Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam.

The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.

The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.

The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.

As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.

Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light.""

Australia is already making ongoing efforts to support Vietnams recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $10.5 million assistance package in June.

Earlier this week the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, the United Nations Development Program and Save the Children Vietnam pledged donations in cash and kind to help central Vietnam.

1520,FL-2021-000021-IND,"Explained: How to tackle a glacial burst, and how is India prepared - The Indian Express",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/uttarakhand-glacier-flash-flood-rishiganga-death-toll-7180258/,"A glacier break is suspected to have caused the flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli on Sunday. Last October, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which is headed by PM Narendra Modi, had issued detailed guidelines on how to reduce and deal with disasters caused by what is scientifically called Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs).

What are GLOFs and how vulnerable are the Himalayas?

When glaciers melt, the water in glacial lakes accumulates behind loose, natural “glacial/moraine dams” made of ice, sand, pebbles and ice residue. A GLOF refers to the flooding that occurs when the water dammed by a glacier or a moraine is released suddenly.

Unlike earthen dams, the weak structure of the moraine dam leads to the abrupt failure of the dam on top of the glacial lake, which holds large volume of water. A failure of the dam has the potential of releasing millions of cubic metres of water in a short period, causing catastrophic flooding downstream. Peak flows as high as 15,000 cubic metre per second have been recorded in such events.

According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes, which are the major cause of GLOFs. Since glaciers in the Himalayas are in a retreating phase, glacial lakes are growing and pose a potentially large risk to downstream infrastructure and life.

An “Inventory and Monitoring of Glacial Lakes / Water Bodies in the Himalayan Region of Indian River Basins”, sponsored by Climate Change Directorate, Central Water Commission, and done by National Remote Sensing Centre during 2011-15, found that there are 352, 283 and 1,393 glacial lakes and water bodies in the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra basins respectively.

How can the risk be reduced?

The NDMA guidelines say that risk reduction has to begin with identifying and mapping such lakes, taking structural measures to prevent their sudden breach, and establishing mechanism to save lives and property in times of a breach.

According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes. According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes.

Potentially dangerous lakes can be identified based on field observations, records of past events, geomorphologic and geotechnical characteristics of the lake/dam and surroundings, and other physical conditions.

NDMA has recommended use of Synthetic-Aperture Radar imagery to automatically detect changes in water bodies, including new lake formations, during the monsoon months. It has said methods and protocols could also be developed to allow remote monitoring of lake bodies from space.

To manage lakes structurally, the NDMA recommends reducing the volume of water with methods such as controlled breaching, pumping or siphoning out water, and making a tunnel through the moraine barrier or under an ice dam.

A landslide occurred along the Phuktal (tributary to Zanskar river) on December 31, 2014 in Kargil district of Ladakh, leading to a potential flood situation on May 7, 2015. The NDMA created an Expert Task Force which, along with the Army, used explosives to channel water from the river using controlled blasting and manual excavation of debris.

How well is India prepared?

While some work on identification of such lakes has been done by CWC, other aspects are still a work in progress: a robust early warning system, and a broad framework for infrastructure development, construction and excavation in vulnerable zones.

“In contrast to other countries, there are no uniform codes for excavation, construction and grading codes in India. Restricting constructions and development in GLOF/LLOF prone areas is a very efficient means to reduce risks at no cost,” the NDMA guidelines say.

The guidelines say construction of any habitation should be prohibited in the high hazard zone. “Existing buildings are to be relocated to a safer nearby region and all the resources for the relocation have to be managed by Central/State governments. New infrastructures in the medium hazard zone have to be accompanied by specific protection measures.”

The guidelines emphasise the importance of land use planning: “There are no widely accepted procedures or regulation in India for land use planning in the GLOF/LLOF prone areas. Such regulations need to be developed… There should be monitoring systems prior to, during, and after construction of infrastructure and settlements in the downstream area.”

Are there early warning systems in place?

The number of implemented and operational GLOF EWS is still very small, even at the global scale. In the Himalayan region, there are at three reported instances (two in Nepal and one in China) of implementation of sensor- and monitoring-based technical systems for GLOF early warning.

India, though, has a remarkable history of successful warnings in relation to Landslide Lake Outburst Floods (LLOFs), dating back to the 19th century. In 1894, a landslide in Gohna, Uttarakhand dammed the main river. On July 5 that year, the engineer in charge estimated the lake would overflow the dam in mid-August, which eventually happened.

Despite the devastating impact of the flood, including washing away of most buildings along the river and severe destruction in Srinagar, no victims were reported, thanks to the precise prediction and the early warning to the population. This was made possible by the installation of a telephone line between the lake and the downstream towns of Chamoli, Srinagar etc.

Rescue operations continued well into the night on Monday as personnel of the ITBP, NDRF and Army worked to locate around 170 people, mostly labourers working at two power projects, who are still reported missing. Rescue operations continued well into the night on Monday as personnel of the ITBP, NDRF and Army worked to locate around 170 people, mostly labourers working at two power projects, who are still reported missing.

What are the guidelines for rescue?

Apart from pressing specialised forces such as NDRF, ITBP and the Army, NDMA has emphasised the need for trained local manpower.

“Experience has shown that over 80 percent of search and rescue is carried out by the local community before the intervention of the state machinery and specialised search and rescue teams. Thus, trained and equipped teams consisting of local people must be set up in GLOF and LLOF prone areas,” NDMA has said. These local teams, it has said, will also assist in planning and setting up emergency shelters, distributing relief packages, identifying missing people, and addressing the needs for food, healthcare, water supply etc.

It has also called for a comprehensive alarm systems. “Besides classical alarming infrastructure consisting of acoustic alarms by sirens, modern communication technology using cell and smart phones can complement or even replace traditional alarming infrastructure,” NDMA has said.

It has asked for provision of heavy earthmoving and search and rescue equipment, as well as motor launches, country boats, inflatable rubber boats, life jackets etc. Acknowledging that a disaster spot in the Himalayas can at times be inaccessible to earthmovers, NDMA has recommended “innovative methods using locally available natural resources”. “It is important to innovate and design lighter machinery, which are more suitable to be carried in the mountains in a disassembled form,” it has said, suggesting these parts can be carried in a helicopter.

For emergency medical response, NDMA has called for Quick Reaction Medical Teams, mobile field hospitals, Accident Relief Medical Vans, and heli-ambulances in areas inaccessible by roads. The guidelines also call for psychological counselling of victims, apart from dissemination of accurate information through press conferences and mass media.",2021-02-15 08:00:00+00:00,"['itbp', 'lakes', 'river', 'guidelines', 'explained', 'prepared', 'india', 'water', 'glacial', 'lake', 'tackle', 'burst', 'ndma', 'uttarakhand', 'rescue']",India,news article,English

According to the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD), the Climate Outlook for the 2021 March-April-May â??Long Rainsâ? season indicates that several parts of the country will experience enhanced rainfall while North Eastern parts of the country will receive below-average rainfall. Based on the state of the Ocean and the early onset, KMD has been issuing heavy rainfall advisories with the most recent being 19 April 2021. The advisory indicated that heavy rainfall was expected over North East, South East, the Coastal Regions of Kenya, Western and Central regions including Nairobi Area. As predicted, from mid-March heavy rainfalls have been experienced in the country with the Western parts of the country being the most affected through displacement of populations and disruption of livelihoods. Tana River county has received moderate rains, but some parts have been affected by flash floods due to waters from the rains upstream.

Effects from the rains have been observed as early as of the 7 of April with the KRCS responding with local resources to the minor emergencies since the onset. Since the 16 of April, the effects have worsened leading to displacements of population and livelihood disruptions, with the KRCS scaling up its response, especially in the provision of shelter services. This increase of the impact, the need to continue to scale up the KRCS response, as well as the latest forecast issued on the 19 April, signaling a continuation of the rains for the next seven days, have triggered the request for a DREF allocation to support the ongoing operation, replenishment of already used resources, and allowing any possible scale up.

The â??Long Rainsâ? currently being experienced have brought heavy rain and subsequent flooding to Counties of the counties of Tana River, Busia, Kisumu, Garissa, and Marsabit. Based on latest assessments from Kenya Red Cross staff and volunteers the flooding has displaced a total of 4,493 households (26,958 people). At this time two deaths have been reported. Some of the displaced persons are hosted in makeshift camps and others hosted by friends and relatives. KRCS is coordinating with local administration to set up displacements' camps. In addition, 3,232 acres of land with crops have been destroyed in the Tana River basin.

With regards to looking ahead, the forecast indicates that the Lake Basin region, parts of the Highlands East of the Rift Valley (including Nairobi county), the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, parts of the North-West, the Southern Rift Valley and Central Rift are forecasted to experience enhanced rainfall. Particularly concerning are the risks associated with the major dams in the eastern part of the country overflowing into some major rivers (such as Tana river and Athi river) leading to flooding and displacement along the riverine basin. The surface and river flooding will compound the lakes backflow that has been seen for the past 2 years around Rift valley lakes and Lake Victoria.

This situation could lead to over 300,000 people displaced by flood as recently experienced in 2019 October-November-December (OND) short rains and 2020 March-April-May long rain (MAM) which caused substantial flooding. It is also likely that a significant number of communities will be marooned for a long period of time, posing access challenges in the immediate aftermath of the flood event.

The current arrangements in Kenya humanitarian partners is that the Kenya Red Cross (KRCS) provides leadership in response to the needs of up to 150,000 flood affected people whilst any additional number in excess of the 150,000 will activate the response by the international community (UN and NGOs). This means KRCS and its partners including movement partners will target to respond to the needs of people up to 150,000. The UN agencies will respond to the excess of 150,000 people.",2021-04-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['n', 'mdrke047', 'rift', 'parts', 'rainfall', 'country', 'river', 'action', 'krcs', 'emergency', 'plan', 'valley', 'kenya', 'epoa', 'flooding', 'rains', 'floods']",Kenya,news article,English
1079,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Volcanoes may have triggered riots in ancient Egypt - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/volcanoes-may-have-triggered-riots-ancient-egypt,"Volcanoes may have triggered riots in ancient Egypt

Famine is no pharaoh’s friend—just ask Cleopatra or Ptolemy III. But those rulers may have had more to blame than just bad luck: According to a new study, volcanic eruptions around the ancient world likely suppressed the Nile’s annual floods—critical for agriculture—by altering rainfall upriver in the Ethiopian highlands several times from the third to first centuries B.C.E. The climatic consequences of those eruptions may have helped trigger tax riots and other forms of social unrest, social scientists say.

“This is a terrific combination of scientific and humanities research,” says Graham Oliver, a historian at Brown University who wasn’t involved in the new analysis. “[It’s] a really important contribution to our understanding of the ancient world.”

Long before the use of sophisticated irrigation equipment, those along the lower Nile relied on natural flooding in the late summer and fall to deliver water—and fertile sediment—to the floodplains where they farmed their crops, says Francis Ludlow, a historical climatologist at Trinity College in Dublin. Without the floods, the soil became parched, boosting the risk of crop failure the following year. On average, 85% of the Nile’s flow originates from rains in the highlands of Ethiopia.

Elsewhere in the world, volcanoes were erupting, as shown by higher levels of sulfates in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica. In modern times, such eruptions have been linked to low summer flooding along the Nile. To find out just how low, Ludlow and his colleagues turned to the Islamic Nilometer, the longest running annual measurement of river flow, which records the highest level of the Nile from 622 to 1902. The team found that flood levels in the 60 years with volcanic eruptions were about 22 centimeters lower, on average, than they were in years without eruptions, they report today in Nature Communications .

Once the team discovered the link between volcanic eruptions and reduced Nile flooding, they turned their attention to more ancient times—specifically, to the period from 305 B.C.E. to 30 B.C.E., when Greeks ruled a dynasty centered in Egypt. They used climate simulations to estimate the effects of volcanic eruptions on summer monsoon rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands. Those analyses suggested that large eruptions indeed reduced the rainfall needed to trigger fall floods along the lower Nile. This likely happened when volcano-spewed sulfur dioxide wafted high into the atmosphere, scattering sunlight back into space and briefly lowering global temperature and changing precipitation patterns, among other effects.

“It’s clear that volcanic eruptions systematically suppressed Nile flow,” says Joseph Manning, a historian at Yale University and co-author of the new analysis.

Separate analyses of documents from ancient Egypt—everything from inscriptions on monuments to tax records, poems, and letters—hint that eruptions may have contributed to social unrest, including riots, tensions between Egyptians and their Greek overlords, famines and plagues, and farmers abandoning their land and moving to the cities. In some cases, these effects came soon after the eruptions; in other cases, they didn’t occur until the following year. Ludlow and his colleagues are quick to point out that volcanic eruptions didn’t directly cause social unrest, but were instead possible triggers for already simmering tensions. “Many people think that history unfolds on a blank chessboard and that the environment is not a factor, but of course it is,” Ludlow says.

The team’s analysis is very convincing, says Heli Huhtamaa, a climate historian at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Using a variety of records “is an important part of putting together the effects of the eruptions,” she notes.

But some scientists are skeptical, including Kenneth Verosub, a geophysicist at the University of California, Davis. For one thing, he thinks the team should have compared the results of their climate simulations with real-world data such as tree-ring data from the Ethiopian highlands.

Interpreting ancient documents is “often very complicated,” Manning says. Plus, he notes, for some periods within the 3 centuries of Greek rule in Egypt, documents such as tax records aren’t readily available. But that lack may itself be a clue, he says, suggesting a loss of state control of Egyptian society.",2017-10-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['records', 'egypt', 'eruptions', 'volcanic', 'university', 'social', 'nile', 'triggered', 'volcanoes', 'team', 'unrest', 'ludlow', 'riots', 'ancient']",Egypt,news article,English
1361,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Ontario cuts conservation authority funding for flood programs - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-flooding-cuts-conservation-1.5105897,"Ontario conservation authorities say the provincial government has cut their funding for flood management programs in half.

Conservation Ontario, which represents the province's 36 conservation authorities, said impacts of the cuts will be felt immediately, particularly in smaller and more rural areas.

""Cutting natural hazards funding is particularly problematic right now in light of the fact that — like everywhere else — Ontario is experiencing stronger and more frequent flood events as a result of climate change impacts,"" general manager Kim Gavine said in a statement.

""Using a watershed-based approach, conservation authorities deliver effective and cost efficient flood management programs across the province, partnering for many years with the province, municipalities and others.""

Ontario had given $7.4 million to the conservation authorities for that work, but they say that has now been reduced by 50 per cent.

Conservation authorities forecast flooding and issue warnings, monitor stream flow, regulate development activities in flood plains, educate the public about flooding and protect natural cover that helps reduce the impacts of flooding.

Natural Resources and Forestry Minister John Yakabuski said the government is trying to eliminate the deficit — currently at $11.7 billion — and has asked conservation authorities to focus on their core mandate.

""Flood control is part of that core mandate and we've asked them to focus on that,"" he said.

""Across the province we average less than 10 per cent of conservation authorities' funding. In fact, some of them are as low as 2.5 per cent provincial funding. And we've heard from different conservation authorities across the province that have said that this will not affect their ability to deal with flood management.""

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said it's short-sighted, when a flood on one day in August last year in Toronto cost $80 million in insurable losses.

""I don't think there's any way to reconcile saying, 'Focus on your core mandate and then we're going to cut your core mandate in half,' especially at a moment in time when we know the intensity of storms is going up, the risk of flooding is going up, the costs associated with that are going up,"" he said.

The chief administrative officer of Quinte Conservation said his organization has relied on the province's transfer payment to fund essential flood programs throughout its 6,000 square-kilometre watershed.

""The government has been very clear about its goal to reduce costs, but a 50-per-cent reduction in payments that support government mandated responsibilities will have a significant impact on how we can deliver our programs and services,"" Brad McNevin said in a statement.",2019-04-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['province', 'mandate', 'ontario', 'going', 'funding', 'authorities', 'core', 'conservation', 'cuts', 'authority', 'flood', 'programs']",Canada,news article,English

300,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Why Lightning Disproportionately Kills the Poor - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/lightning-deaths-india/488261/,"Seventy-nine people died this week in lightning strikes in India. Most of the dead lived in rural areas, and many were farmers. It’s the rainy season and storms are frequent this time of year. It might seem like an astonishing number in such a short time, but Indian government statistics point out that 2,000 people are killed by lightning strikes each year.

India’s population is about four times larger than that of the U.S., but about 2 people in 1 million die from lightning strikes in India; in the U.S., that figure is 0.3 per million.

The discrepancy holds for Europe, where lightning kills a tiny fraction of the population each year, about 0.2 people for every 1 million. Then there are parts of Asia and Africa, where lighting deaths can be 100 times higher. In Zimbabwe it’s around 20 per 1 million. In Malawi it’s 84 people per million. While lightning may seem to strike and kill at random, it’s mostly a problem of the poor.

As my colleague Rebecca J. Rosen has pointed out, the U.S. is a good example of how a country has gone from a relatively high rate of lightning deaths, to one of the lowest. One reason often pointed to is the move from farm to city. In 1900 about 60 percent of Americans lived in rural areas; by 2000 about 20 percent did. In step with that, lightning deaths decreased. This correlation is sometimes regarded as the cause of the decrease––and rural areas certainly are more dangerous when it comes to strikes––but in 100 years the U.S. population has jumped from 63 million to 323 million. There are more people everywhere, even in rural parts.

Why then are people not fried by bolts in increasing numbers? The answer, in part, is plumbing and tractors.

In the 1890s, lightning most commonly killed people asleep on their beds inside their homes. That doesn’t happen anymore. By now, if lightning strikes a home there’s enough wiring and plumbing for the electricity to ground out. In the 1920s, only 1 percent of homes in the U.S. had electricity and plumbing. By the 1930s, the U.S. had developed codes regulating both, and as more buildings followed those regulations they became safer. Since the 1950s, nearly all homes in the U.S. have both electricity and plumbing, and consequently, Ronald Holle, a meteorologist with Vaisala, the world’s largest manufacturer of meteorological equipment, told me lightning deaths inside homes in the U.S. have become nonexistent. In the past 20 years, he said not one person in the U.S. (excluding the elderly or disabled who were caught in fires started by lightning) has died from a lightning bolt that hit a home. But in poor areas of the world, homes may not have all those wires and pipes that help divert electrical shock. Those homes often have a thin roof made of corrugated metal. And if lightning hits that, the bolt can jump to the nearest person.

The other place lightning often struck people in the 1890s in America was in the fields. One hundred years ago, 25 percent of lightning deaths in the U.S. were people working agricultural jobs. And that’s who died in India this week.

Every year Indian farmers make up a large portion of the 2,500 people killed by lightning in the country. A recent report by Holle, the meteorologist, looked at 969 lightning deaths in at least 10 Asian countries and found most farmers died working in rice paddy fields, which are often huge tracts of flat and flooded land. Holle wrote that what famers desperately need in these areas is someplace close to shelter: “Fully enclosed metal-topped vehicles can provide such a lightning-safe location but they may not be available nearby when needed … ”

An Indian farmer named Lal Babu Usvaha told The Guardian that “work is work. We can’t stop because of the weather. We have to keep working in the fields. But we feel scared when we see so many clouds, so much electricity in the sky.”

India has adopted newer farming technologies, but as the man who spoke with The Guardian points out, many poor farmers still use preindustrial methods to work the field. This was the same issue the U.S. had 100 years ago, and that began to change with the advent of the tractor.

Tractors used today in big U.S. agricultural operations are fully enclosed, making them as safe as a car during a storm. Tractors also reduced the number of people needed to raise and pick crops (see The Grapes of Wrath).

“The amount of time it takes to work a field has changed,” Holle told me. “Back then it might have taken you all day to do a small plot of land. Now it can be done in a few hours. ​​​​​​”

That’s another major factor: In developed countries, people work outdoors less, and so are at less risk of being caught in a storm and killed. Nowadays in the U.S., lightning almost exclusively kills athletes and outdoor-leisure enthusiasts––fisherman the most, then beach goers, then campers. For sports, it’s soccer players.

Other technologies, like the advent of CPR, have helped reduce lightning deaths. And another big factor has been information about lightning. John Jensenius, the National Weather Service’s lightning specialist, told me that the number of lightning deaths now are half what they were 15 years ago. Jensenius partly attributed this reduction to Lightning Awareness Week, which started around 15 years ago. Its credo: “When lightning roars, go indoors!”

But in poorer countries, it might not help even if they followed that motto. In some parts of Africa, lightning strikes that hit schools kill hundreds of children each year.

“It’s gotten to the point where some parents have said, ‘I’m not sending my kids to school because that’s where they get killed,’” Holle said.

The numbers are bit of a rough estimate, because not all countries keep the data, but each year lightning kills about 24,000 people. And while the strikes themselves may be random, the victims are almost exclusively poor.",2016-06-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['lightning', 'areas', 'deaths', 'kills', 'killed', 'disproportionately', 'strikes', 'holle', 'told', 'work', 'poor', 'million', 'homes']",India,news article,English
805,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,UNICEF Supply Annual Report 2018 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/unicef-supply-annual-report-2018,"Partnerships and innovation help UNICEF deliver results for children in 150 countries

In 2018, UNICEF reached nearly half the world’s children with vaccines; provided 13.3 million bed nets and nearly 50,000 tonnes of ready-to-use food

COPENHAGEN / NEW YORK, 24 July 2019 - In 2018, UNICEF procured US$3.486 billion worth of goods and services to help children in 150 countries live better lives.

Vaccines, clothes, medicines, education kits and school books are some of the goods and services that helped children fight disease, learn, and grow -- especially in countries affected by emergencies and conflicts.

In 2018, UNICEF helped children by:

Procuring 2.36 billion doses of vaccines to fight a variety of diseases including measles, diphtheria, tetanus and HPV, and reach nearly half the world’s children

Providing children access to safe water with 1.26 billion water purification tablets and chlorination/flocculation sachets

Protecting children from mosquito-borne diseases using 13.3 million bed nets

Treating children suffering from malnutrition with 47,760 tonnes of ready-to-use therapeutic food

Helping children get back in the classroom with 4.5 million schoolbags and 84,000 education kits

“Every child is unique and so are their needs,” said Etleva Kadilli, Director of UNICEF’s Supply Division in Copenhagen. “Procuring supplies for children is not as simple as buying products off the shelf. It requires close collaboration with diverse partners to ensure children in different countries and areas get what they need to live, improve their lives, and be safe and healthy.”

As situations in countries become more complex, especially during emergencies, the ability to adapt and do things differently can help to maximize impact for children and their families.

In East Asia and Pacific, the September 2018 earthquake and tsunami off Sulawesi island affected more than 375,000 children in and around Palu city. UNICEF supported the Government-led response by using small aircraft to bring supplies as close as possible to those in need. The Government then delivered them to the affected area. A strong in-country supply chain and Government pre-positioning quickly reduced the need for UNICEF support.

Together with a global network of stakeholders, UNICEF is developing new products and approaches to meet the needs of the hardest-to-reach. This isn’t limited to product innovation alone, but also includes working with partners, especially businesses, to influence markets and make products for children more accessible, affordable, safe and sustainable.

For example:

To help children recover from malnutrition, UNICEF procured a record 65 per cent of ready-to-use therapeutic food from manufacturers located in or close to countries with the greatest need. This not only supported local economies but also made transportation more efficient and reduced the carbon footprint.

In the Syrian Arab Republic, despite the conflict, UNICEF is working with local businesses that continue to operate to provide hygiene and education kits, as well as warm clothes – helping UNICEF deliver supplies to children quickly.

In Nigeria, UNICEF convened a landmark Regional Sanitation Industry Consultation to encourage cross-border collaboration with Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire and identify ways to improve the availability of affordable toilets and sanitation services for families.

“The support of governments, businesses, donors and our partners on the ground has been invaluable in allowing us to reach millions of children as quickly as possible”, added Kadilli. “Yet the needs remain immense. Sustainable, long-term funding must continue to be a priority for us to meet the needs of children in increasingly complex situations.”

1521,FL-2021-000021-IND,Chamoli glacier burst: Himalayan blunders compounded - Down To Earth Magazine,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/chamoli-glacier-burst-himalayan-blunders-compounded-75504,"The issue is about carrying capacity of the fragile region, which is even more at risk because of climate change

The flash flood in high Himalayas, which has claimed lives and wiped out two hydroelectric plants on the Ganga, should be a grim reminder of the mistakes we continue to make. There is no rocket science here about why this devastation happened. The Himalayas are the world’s youngest mountain ranges, prone to erosion and landslides and unstable because of high seismic activity.

This is compounded by the sheer madness — I will explain why I say this — of development, with hydropower projects being built back to back. On top of this, climate change and its resultant warming of glaciers and unseasonal snow and heat are exacerbating conditions in the already fragile ecosystem. On February 7, 2021, the people of Reni village — the birthplace of India’s environmental consciousness as this is where the women stopped the felling of trees — say they heard a loud bang.

Within minutes the muddy deluge gushed down damaging the 13.2 MW Rishiganga hydropower project and then washing away the under-construction 520 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad project downstream. It is not clear (as yet) if the glacier melted; or there was unseasonal snow that melted; or that it was a combination.

What’s clear is that there was a landslide or avalanche that blocked the river and when the natural dam broke because of the force of water, it brought the power of kilolitres of water mixed with moraine, rock and silt. It is important to note is that this flash flood occurred in winter, when there is less water; so, destruction was limited. It should be a warning of the scale of devastation that can happen. There is no question that we are going to see more of this, not less, unless we change the way we do business with the environment.

But more importantly it will happen until we take better studied decisions on the projects and on mitigating their impacts. This is where we falter. Our systems for decision-making to assess the impacts of “development” projects were already weak and have become virtually non-existent by now. The processes of decision-making are firmly in the hands of faceless and nameless committees, where papers are shuffled around to get the desired results.

This is where the Himalayan saga must be understood. I saw it from the insides when I was briefly a member of an inter-ministerial group on issues related to the Ganga in 2013. What I found was appalling and, frankly, depressing. The water and power engineers had calculated the hydropower potential as 9,000 MW, which would be generated by 70-odd projects, small and big. As per their own admission these projects, mostly in the upper catchment of Uttarakhand Himalayas, would “affect” 80-90 per cent of the stretches of the river.

As these are mostly run-of-the-river projects where the water is diverted through tunnels or reservoirs and then released into the river, this meant that the river would not flow naturally, but would be re-constructed to 80-90 per cent of its length. The projects were designed to draw the last drop of water and during lean seasons, as per the project designers, the river would cease to flow naturally.

The inter-ministerial group was to assess this and provide guidance on the required ecological flows. The engineers argued 10 per cent ecological flow would be adequate and this is how they had designed the plethora of projects. The interest in building hydropower was obviously huge — it came from all sides; from energy industry and construction to political leaders who saw this as development opportunities for their region. But now that the list of the projects was on the table (over 6,000 MW had not been built yet), the question was how these could be justified.

I argued that the projects had to be re-worked — both the commissioned ones and those on the table — so that the ecological flow was 30 per cent of the high flood water season and 50 per cent of the low water season. I argued that projects would need to mimic the river and not the other way around. Based on extensive calculations my colleagues and I showed this re-design would not compromise on tariff or generation capacity of existing projects.

But it would mean that the number of projects would need to be drastically reduced. This was not acceptable. I wrote then how hydropower researchers at the premier Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Roorkee then manipulated data to justify that up to 25 per cent of ecological flow for 8 months and 30 per cent in lean water months would be adequate. Forget that it would dry up the river; make the mighty Ganga — which holds the collective consciousness of the country — nothing more than an engineered drain. It was okay.

My dissent was noted. And the report cleared business as usual. Since 2013, much more water has flowed down the Ganga and there has been much activism from courts and governments about the need to curtail these projects. But after all the big talk, not much has changed.

As of today, some 7,000 MW of hydroelectric projects are either operating or being constructed in this fragile region; back to back; with no respect for the river or its need to flow naturally. The issue is not about hydropower generation or the need for energy or development. It is about the carrying capacity of this fragile region, which is even more at risk because of climate change.

This needs to be assessed, but by keeping the river first and our needs next. Otherwise, the river will continue to teach us bitter lessons; it will be the revenge and rage of nature. Humans will be shown as the puny things we are.",2021-02-11 08:00:00+00:00,"['need', 'glacier', 'river', 'chamoli', 'himalayan', 'mw', 'water', 'ganga', 'flow', 'region', 'projects', 'blunders', 'burst', 'compounded', 'hydropower', 'cent']",India,news article,English
1563,FL-2021-000021-IND,U'khand glacier burst: River Alaknanda in Srinagar flowing below warning level - BW Businessworld,http://www.businessworld.in/article/U-khand-glacier-burst-River-Alaknanda-in-Srinagar-flowing-below-warning-level/07-02-2021-374840,"New Delhi [India], February 7 (ANI): Amid the concerns over the avalanche triggered after a glacial burst in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on Sunday, the Central Water Commission (CWC) informed that River Alaknanda at Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal is flowing 'much below' the warning level.

""River Alaknanda at Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal, Uttrakhand is flowing much below the warning level as the impact of Glacial Lake burst is felt only up to Joshimath,"" tweeted the CWC.

Amrendra Kumar Sengar, IG National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said: ""Since the flow of water was very fast initially, bodies are being recovered far away from the incident site. Some are trapped in deep areas and others in tunnels, so there is issue of access.""

The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has rescued all 16 people who were trapped in the tunnel near the Tapovan area following a glacier burst.

The ITBP was carrying out the rescue operation at the tunnel near Tapovan dam in Chamoli to rescue trapped people. At least nine bodies have been recovered from the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) site in the Tapovan area, informed SS Deswal, Director General, ITBP.

""It is suspected that around 100 workers were at the site out of which, 9-10 dead bodies have been recovered from the river,"" he said.

Meanwhile, seven Navy diving teams are on standby for the flash flood relief operations in the state, said the Navy officials.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of those who lost their lives due to the glacial burst.

Addressing a press conference, Trivendra Singh Rawat said, ""The state government will provide financial assistance of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of the deceased.""



As it was the last day of the week (Sunday), fortunately, many workers from Uttarakhand were on week off today, he added.



Nearly 180 sheep and goats were believed to have been swept away in the flash flood, said Rawat adding five locals including three shepherds and two women who were cutting grass had lost their lives in the disaster.



""We are assuming that around 125 people are missing. The number can be higher,"" Rawat said. He added that the government has all the needed assistance to handle the situation for now. (ANI)

(The only world in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief of staff actually assigns journalists is the fever swamp of right-wing conspiracy theories).

No, this column was inspired by the sight of sandbags and portable toilets on the streets of a neighbourhood near the Ottawa River where I very nearly bought a house four years ago. That those negotiations fell through, in retrospect, was a bolt of luck for which I am now profoundly grateful.

I would never consider buying near the river nowadays, for obvious reasons, and my guess is the miserable residents on those sandbagged streets spend a lot of time contemplating both their home values and the next catastrophic flood. There have been two in the last three years. The Ottawa River surged past its banks weeks ago, and is still frighteningly swollen.

It never occurred to me, back in 2015, to check whether the home we tried to buy was at risk of flooding. Being near the river was a plus, not a threat. And even if I had checked, it probably wouldn't have done much good. Flood plain maps in Canada are about 25 years out of date.

But that's about to change. Next year, the federal government will begin uploading nearly 2,000 user-friendly flood plain maps, updating them with the most recent geospatial data. Eventually, entire communities will find themselves publicly identified as at-risk. What that will do to the value of their homes and their flood insurance premiums (assuming they can even get insurance), is obvious.

Drastic market devaluation

""Oh! Oh!,"" says Prof. Blair Feltmate, delighted to have been asked. ""There is going to be a massive devaluation of the housing industry in Canada, guaranteed. A million will turn into $500,000 very rapidly.""

Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, one of those elite, leading-expert Cassandras so many of us just try to ignore.

Now, before the fever swampers start yelling conspiracy, this push to update flood plain maps is not coming from Liberal climate-change evangelists like Catherine McKenna, Trudeau's environment minister. Or David Suzuki. Or the Green Party. It is coming from the insurance industry. Put another way, conservatives: market forces. Feltmate's centre is largely funded by Intact Insurance, one of the industry's biggest players.

That's hardly surprising; no industry's profits are more immediately threatened by climate change than insurance. Between 1983 and 2008, says Feltmate, annual insurance payouts for catastrophic events in Canada, mostly flooding, averaged between $250 million and $450 million a year. In nine of the 10 years since 2009, the average annual payout has been $1.8 billion. The average payout for a flooded basement is $43,000 and rising.

So the industry wants two things: to push for flood-proofing, and to reassess premiums (or decide where not to insure, period). For that, it needs data. New, updated flood risk maps will give it clear justification to begin dramatically hiking premiums for some homeowners, or refusing them insurance completely. It doesn't take much imagination to guess what will happen when the new maps begin to appear.

""It will put the new areas (newly included in flood plains) into panic mode,"" says Feltmate.

""There will be big pushback, big alarm. Now your home is stigmatized. A home is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to write a cheque for, and who would write a big cheque for a house suddenly identified as at risk of flooding?

""You will see people begin to default on their mortgages, because they know they owe more on the home than it will ever be worth.""

The shorthand term for that in the real estate market is ""going underwater."" Until now, that term was figurative, not literal.

Furthermore, says Feltmate, the new data will also confirm what experts have known for some time: five per cent of at-risk homes in Canada cannot be saved. Their owners will have to evacuate.

Incentives to relocate

That's already begun. The (conservative) Quebec government, citing climate change, has decided to cap flooding relief, and is now offering residents in areas at extreme risk of flooding $200,000 to move somewhere else.

The reaction, of course, was immediate. Flooded homeowners all over the province told reporters that the government offer doesn't begin to cover what they think is the value of their homes. In fact, their homes' true value, in some cases, is now probably close to zero. After the catastrophes of 2017 and 2019, who would buy a home near the water in Pointe Gatineau, across from Ottawa? Or Lac Deux Montagnes, west of Montreal? Or parts of London, Ontario, or Calgary?

Feltmate says governments may eventually have to force high-risk residents to leave: Here's some money, we're shutting off your utilities.

And, he says, it's not a matter of whether there will be more flooding.

""What we have seen so far is nothing compared to what is coming. It is simply fact that the atmosphere is warming, and warmer air carries more moisture. This is the new normal.""

The changes that have taken place so far, says Feltmate – and this is on public record, most recently affirmed in the alarming report by federal scientists released last month – are irreversible. And it is going to get worse, faster, and soon.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)

Home inspectors, most of them until now minimally trained in basement flood assessment, are taking courses that will no doubt become mandatory. Colleges are actually putting the courses online. Mortgage providers will almost certainly begin demanding such assessments as a condition of approval. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which insures mortgages, will likely start insisting on it.

If there is any good news here, it is that communities and homeowners can take steps to drastically reduce flood risk. It will be possible to effectively remediate yourself off those flood plain maps, and protect the value of your home. But it will cost money.

Feltmate's Intact Centre lists steps anyone can take to keep the basement dry during anything short of Noah's flood. Installing two sump pumps with battery backup that will keep working when the power goes out. Waterproofing windows at ground level. Ensuring downspouts empty a good distance from your foundation. Installing backflow valves. Clearing eavestroughs and drains. Even digging up and replacing the grading around your house.

And, says Feltmate, people with homes on higher ground shouldn't feel smug. ""Waterbomb"" storms, now happening far more frequently, can (and will) turn an entire city into a flood plain instantly. At-risk communities can install concrete barriers, berms, diversion channels, underground cisterns, and improve natural swales – wetlands and marshes that act as natural drains.

And governments must start forbidding new home construction on flood plains. Unbelievably, most provinces – Ontario is the only one that asserts provincial control — leave that decision to municipalities, some of which, idiotically, still allow it, under pressure from developers and craving new property tax revenue.

The plain reality is that flood-proofing Canada will be staggeringly, historically costly. But the cost of not flood-proofing Canada will be incalculable.

It absolutely has to be done, and it has to be done now. The only question is, who's going to pay for it?

That's a political question. And it's not a subject Katie Telford, or anybody in any party trying to win this fall's election, probably wants to talk about right now. There's a reason those maps weren't updated for a quarter century.

SAO PAULO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A rare bomb cyclone lashed southern Brazil, leaving at least 10 people dead and forcing more than 1,000 people to evacuate their homes, local Civil Defense authorities said on Wednesday.

Nine of the deaths were reported in the state of Santa Catarina, where one person has also been reported missing. The tenth victim was in southernmost Rio Grande do Sul state bordering on neighboring Argentina and Uruguay.

An atypical climate event for the region, meteorologists said the ""extratropical bomb cyclone,"" or rapidly developing storm, originated in the Atlantic Ocean and whipped southern Brazil with winds of up to 110 kilometers per hour.

The cyclone knocked out power to at least 48 towns, some 686,000 homes, in Santa Catarina.

Florianopolis, the capital of Santa Catarina, and its metropolitan region were the hardest hit, registering six deaths due to landslides and mudslides.

""We have never seen anything like it. We always believed we were far from the kind of phenomena we were used to seeing on television of the Caribbean,"" a resident of Ilhota, a community in greater Florianopolis, told local media.

Strong winds and heavy rains ripped away tile roofs and sheet roofing, and uprooted electricity poles.

Winds of up to 80 kilometers per hour reached as far as the southeast states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the meteorological service reported.

On the coast of Sao Paulo, damage to a marina caused eight boats to sink.

In Curitiba, Parana state, cellphone video captured rooftops blown away by winds of over 100 kilometers per hour.

The governments of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana issued flood warnings and evacuated more than 1,000 people.

1073,FL-2016-000114-EGY,The Purchase of The Egyptian: Why Netflix Needs a Pyramid - FLOOD Magazine,https://floodmagazine.com/71075/the-purchase-of-the-egyptian-why-netflix-needs-a-pyramid/,"Amazon sold its first book in 1995—somewhat fittingly, it was Douglas Hofstadter’s Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought. In 2001, Amazon announced its partnership with Borders, an agreement that redirected the Borders website to Amazon’s online book marketplace. Just ten years later, Borders closed its last remaining stores. In a 1992 Census Bureau report, there were 13,136 independent and chain bookstores in The United States. In 2016, that number was 6,448.

Numbers reinforce an industry guard change we all understand on a more personal level with books, toys, electronics, furniture, groceries, and our everyday needs and knick-knacks. Enter a mall and be prepared to feel a sort of vague depression stimulated by the anachronistic storefronts, save for the lone clerks, scrolling their smartphones, biting their nails, straightening already straightened shelves. But some malls stay relevant with edison bulbs and VR experiences—four years ago, brick-and-mortar Amazon Books bookstores began appearing in this type of contemporary retail center, nineteen in total. Without knowing their figures, one can assume these stores—which primarily display Amazon bestsellers and just a shelf or two of the foremost classics—can hardly generate much added revenue for the web superstore. Rather, these storefronts denote banners: nineteen antagonizing monuments to the industry it efficiently and effectively disrupted, then displaced.

Now, for the first time, a streaming service will own and operate a physical theater to project its original films and series. Netflix is set to acquire The Egyptian Theatre, the second most iconic cinema house on the star-studded stretch of Hollywood Boulevard. The purchasing price is estimated in the tens of millions. Its current owner, American Cinematheque—a high-profile nonprofit dedicated to the preservation, projection, and celebration of classic and contemporary independent cinema—will continue to hold screenings on weekends. Beyond this, the official date of purchase, renovation plans, details regarding signage, and any official signature of contracts solidifying the Cinematheque partnership remain opaque.

What does it imply that the streaming service recognized as the forefather of the industry’s digital revolution purchases the first movie theater constructed in Hollywood?

The Egyptian was built by vaudeville showman Sid Grauman in 1922, four years before he erected the Chinese Theatre on the north side of the same strip. Significantly, The Egyptian hosted the first-ever Hollywood premiere, Robin Hood, the same year as the theater’s opening. What does it imply that the streaming service recognized as the forefather of the industry’s digital revolution purchases the first movie theater constructed in Hollywood, the first to host a premiere, and with a structure and name inspired by the civilization known well for their mausoleum-cum-totems for the pharaohs and queens of an era past?

Many know the story to some extent. In 2010, the effects of Netflix sharply surfaced when the ubiquitous Blockbuster chain filed for bankruptcy and its stores started to offload all its copies of Leprechaun 2, The Cable Guy, Jerry Maguire, and shutter. Just a few years later, Netflix shook things up in a bigger way with the production of its first original content program House of Cards, the success of which signaled the clear lucrative path forward to every major entertainment studio and corporate mogul with an interest in not just the financial potential, but also the influence media creators hold.

This history is well-outlined with refreshing objectivity by Ben Fritz in his 2018 book, The Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies. It covers the emergence of Netflix, the Sony leaks, the rise of the superhero and franchise blockbusters, alongside the near-total demise of the mid-budget feature. Ben is also the West Coast editor for the Wall Street Journal, and offered a few insights for this article. Netflix remains outspokenly silent on the subject. American Cinematheque did not respond to requests for comment, but an unnamed employee did reply to an inquiry to say: “gonna be hard to get anyone to talk, frankly.”

“Netflix’s reported plan to buy the Egyptian is a great metaphor for where the entertainment industry is today,” Ben answers regarding the acquisition’s subtext. “Here you have this iconic, beautiful theater on Hollywood Boulevard that shows feature films on a huge screen in a large auditorium. Now a streaming video giant wants to buy it and use it to play the movies it makes, primarily for consumption on televisions, tablets, and phones. The Egyptian would become a marketing and publicity tool for Netflix—a place to show off its movies to press, creative professionals, and the small number of people who will pay extra to see a movie on the big screen they could see at home for free (if they already subscribe, as most people interested in entertainment do). The Egyptian would no longer be a business intended to make profits by selling tickets to films. Because, of course, that business is tiny now compared to the wealth of Netflix and its competitors in subscription streaming video.”

A substantial portion of The Big Picture addresses the shrinking of the theatrical film business. Essentially, once digital streaming was of a high enough quality, DVD sales plummeted (which had nullified poor box office performance throughout the 2000s) and viewers only visited theaters for massive spectacle films that they viewed as guaranteed entertainment and a cultural event. Mid-budget films became too risky to produce. Even though twenty mid-budget films could be made for the price of one superhero epic, that superhero epic had a massive guaranteed return, while each of the dramas, rom-coms, or single-star action vehicles would, on average, lose money—and when one or two did make money, it wasn’t nearly enough to float the others. This was specifically enhanced by the emergence of high-quality television series like Breaking Bad, and with home viewing easier than ever with services like Netflix, risking the price of a month’s subscription for a potentially bad drama in the theater became a non-option for most everyone except the most devoted cinemagoers.

The distinction between television and cinema is degrading. Ben explains that “previously they were very distinct because television was only one thing—twenty-two half-hour or hour-long episode seasons—and feature films were ninety to one hundred and eighty minutes and always shown first in a theater. That was dictated by the respective business models of ad-supported television and theaters that charged per ticket and need to cycle people in and out.”

“Netflix’s plan is a great metaphor for where the entertainment industry is today. You have this iconic theater that shows feature films on a huge screen. Now a streaming video giant wants to buy it and use it to play the movies it makes.”

— Ben Fritz

TV movies and series used to be identifiable by their lower quality due to lower budgets, and feature films were frequently helmed by higher-caliber directors and actors. This has since shifted, and feature films on streaming services are often (subjectively) of a lower quality than series, even when attached to heralded directors and stars. Exceptions abound, but television of varying lengths certainly appears the way forward for creatives and executives alike.

So, to return to the principal question: Why buy a theater when your business is founded on producing television? In large part, one can speculate, it’s because Netflix may be differentiating itself from the competition with a prioritization of the feature format. Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman is certainly a signal in this direction. When, in cinemas, there is little found between the low-budget, often subversive, output from A24, Neon, and Blumhouse, and the franchise tent-poles from the “Big Six,” there could be an underlying demand for the types of films that once represented non-independent theatrical releases, regardless of whether or not they actually appear in a theater. The Egyptian would symbolize this position, which further fuels the debate that surrounds streaming service films as Oscar contenders, since historically most Oscar winners were mid-budget films (if listed from lowest to highest budget, adjusted for inflation, the median budget for a best picture is $30.3 million, approximately that of No Country for Old Men).

“The discussion about what qualifies as cinema now seems hugely important, especially in terms of the Academy Awards,” Fritz continues. “In my opinion, there are basically two choices for the Academy and other institutions or people thinking about this issue. One is to define a movie as a piece of visual media that plays first on a large screen in an auditorium, where its creators intended it to be seen. The other is any piece of visual media intended to be completed in a single sitting (as opposed to an episodic series), no matter the type of screen on which it plays first. If you pick the former, you’re essentially excluding films from Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming services in the future that adopt their model. If you pick the latter, you’re essentially eliminating the difference between what we used to call ‘films’ versus ‘TV movies.’”

In today’s digital media-driven culture, it seems impossible to imagine a future where either the Academy does not loosen its requirements for Oscar contenders, or a new awards ceremony with a more inclusive, forward-looking modus operandi appears on the scene, prepared to recognize that the craft of filmmaking now sees its most venerable players dedicated to a format streamed principally on screens sized between seventy and four inches. Now, the conversation can explore all sorts of avenues, such as the qualitative differences in storytelling between cinematic feature films and television series created by and starring the exact same A-listers, or the significance of the ever-increasing democratization of media, where once viewers can easily place his or her own feature-length film on the world’s largest streaming platform, YouTube, and could “qualify” for the same awards as the likes of Scorsese with his Netflix films, and Spielberg and his future Quibis. However, these topics are perhaps better suited for a living room discussion amongst friends.

Netflix could emerge the hero, build a new awards ceremony, unite the streaming frontier into a cohesive recognition that they are all playing toward the same endgame: somehow keeping viewers interested in mainstream media for a long time to come, regardless of format. (I have to ask now, when will we revolt against the self-defeating and patronizing use of the word “content”?) The Egyptian Theatre might be just the mausoleum for such a ceremony.

Or, Netflix will use The Egyptian as its monument to the Hollywood standard it displaced, projecting its bulk of features and series to pervade the same air of classicism as the films that screened in this theater decades prior, and shall continue, purportedly, through the efforts of American Cinematheque.

Whatever the motive, Netflix is the undisputed forefather of the mass of services and media on our HDMI plates today. The winners of the “streaming wars” won’t be revealed for years to come—but the past is certain, and The Egyptian will be known, at least to those who are obsessed enough to think about it, as a relic of a relic of the past.

ISLAMABAD, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Pakistani villages located at the bank of River Sutlej have been submerged after India released water without notifying the authorities in Pakistan, displacing hundreds of people while destroying several houses and standing crops, said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Thursday.

Over 1,200 persons were rescued from the flood-affected villages by a local administration while another 1,613 persons have been shifted to safer places, according to the NDMA.

Rescue teams along with Pakistan army personnel are taking part in the rescue operations, a local administrative official in Lahore told Xinhua, adding that more than 80 relief camps have been set up for flood affectees so far.

He said water level in the river is continuously rising, and the concerned authorities are making all-out efforts to ensure timely evacuation of people from the affected villages.

A spokesperson of the NDMA Mukhtar Ahmed told local media that three of the villages located near the bed of the river went completely underwater due to flooding, and the people from these most-affected villages have already been evacuated to safer places.

Earlier on Monday, the NDMA had warned of a flood-like situation in the areas alongside the river after India released up to 200,000 million cusecs of excessive water in the River Sutlej that flows through Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.

""The flood alert was issued in order to avoid the loss of lives and properties as India did not communicate the release of water to Pakistan,"" Director General of the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Khurram Shahzad said.

According to a water-distribution agreement between the two neighboring countries, India is bound to pre-schedule its spillway openings, but the incumbent Indian government has canceled all the meetings of Indus Water Commission, which was formed to resolve disputes over water sharing with Pakistan.

Pakistani agricultural experts believe that India is trying to destroy an agro-based economy of the country by taking such measures and using water as an instrument of war, trying to convert agricultural land of Pakistan into deserts through inundation and trickling of water.

The development came when relations between Pakistan and India have been strained after the latter decided to revoke the special status of the Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.

In its response, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations and suspended trade ties with India.",2019-08-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['displaces', 'hundreds', 'houses', 'local', 'pakistan', 'water', 'villages', 'notification', 'flood', 'xinhua', 'india', 'ndma', 'trying', 'river', 'told', 'releases']",Pakistan,news article,English

Napoli’s Jose Callejon is desperate to beat Barcelona when they meet them in the United States this week.

The Partenopei will have two bites at the ferry though, with the pair to face off in Florida and Michigan.

“I want to beat Barcelona,” the former Real Madrid player said.

“It’s a special game for me because of my past. It’s a friendly, but it’s very important for us.

“We’ve played well against both Liverpool and Marseille.”

Napoli have finished runners up in both of the most recent seasons in Serie A, second only to Juventus.

“We want to reach the end of the season with the chance of doing great things,” he explained.

“We want to give it our all and hope we have a great year.”

Serie A appears to be improving of late, with Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival at Juventus increasing interest around the world.

“It’s been behind other leagues for a few years,” the Spaniard said.

“But Italy is getting better.

“With the arrival of Cristiano, something is changing in Serie A.”

221,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Applicability of Force Majeure Clauses in the Aftermath of Hurricane Sandy - The Maritime Executive,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/applicability-of-force-majeure-clauses-in-the-aftermath-of-hurricane-sandy,"Applicability of Force Majeure Clauses in the Aftermath of Hurricane Sandy

Hurricane Sandy was the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, and possibly the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, causing damage in excess of approximately USD 50,000,000,000 and claiming the lives of at least one hundred ninety-three (193) individuals.

On October 28, 2012, the USCG Captain of the Port of New York and New Jersey set port condition YANKEE for all commercial waterways requiring, inter alia: (1) commercial deep draft vessels greater than 500 gross tons to evacuate all port piers by 6:00 p.m. local time; and (2) all vessels to evacuate Bay Ridge, Stapleton, and Gravesend Bay anchorage grounds by 6:00 p.m. local time. On October 29, 2012, Sandy’s storm surge hit New York City flooding streets, tunnels and subway lines and causing massive power outages throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It is estimated that litigation arising out of delays and damages caused by Hurricane Sandy will be voluminous as insurance claims continue to mount and disputes over coverage under various policies have already begun.

As individuals and businesses continue to deal with the effects of Hurricane Sandy, many have questioned the applicability of force majeure clauses in charter party contracts, specifically, whether Hurricane Sandy qualifies as an “Act of God,” excusing the non-performance of one (1) or more parties. While each clause is unique and subject to fact specific review, force majeure clauses, in general, will be upheld by Courts of the United States “to relieve a party from its contractual duties when its performance has been prevented by a force beyond its control or when the purpose of the contract has been frustrated.” Phillips Puerto Rico Core, Inc. v. Tradax Petroleum, Ltd., 782 F.2d 314, 319 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1985) (internal citations omitted).

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals (the Federal Circuit governing New York and Connecticut) and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (covering New Jersey and Pennsylvania), have each held that the burden of demonstrating force majeure is on the party seeking to have its performance excused, and the non-performing party must demonstrate its efforts to perform its contractual duties despite the occurrence of the event that it claims constituted force majeure. Phillips Puerto Rico Core, Inc., 782 F.2d at 319 (citing Gulf Oil Corp. v. FERC, 706 F.2d 444, 452 (3d Cir. 1983), cert denied, 464 U.S. 1038, 79 L. Ed. 2d 164, 104 S. Ct. 698 (1984)). In reviewing whether the non-performing party has met these burdens, the Court will conduct a factual review of the specific language and requirements of the contract and the force majeure clause at issue.

Specific issues which deserve consideration include, inter alia, (1) whether a storm, hurricane or weather event was specifically included in the force majeure clause (for example a hurricane can be treated differently in the U.S. Gulf, an area in which such storms are frequent, as opposed to New York and New Jersey); (2) whether Hurricane Sandy actually caused the non-performance; (3) what are the notice requirements (if any) to declare force majeure; (4) when does the force majeure event end thereby allowing performance to be completed; and/or (5) any obligations of the parties to mitigate damages, including whether steps were (or could have been) taken prior to, during, and after the storm which would have enabled the performance of the contract.

In short, before declaring force majeure, or accepting a force majeure declaration from another party under a particular contract, parties should give close consideration to the causal relationship between the storm and the type of performance for which excusal is sought. If the non-performance of a specific contract was not directly related to Hurricane Sandy, it is arguable that force majeure would not apply.

1868,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Class determines vulnerability to catastrophic glacial flooding in northwest Pakistan - Phys.org,https://phys.org/news/2021-02-class-vulnerability-catastrophic-glacial-northwest.html,"Chitrali residents evacuating after a severe flash flood, a now annual occurrence in the region due to glacial melting. Credit: groundreporter/Creative Commons

A recent study examines the link between power structures and vulnerability to flash floods in Reshun. The vulnerable location of Reshun, a village in Upper Chitral District in the northwest of Pakistan, leaves it exposed to natural disaster hazards. It sits along the seismically active Hindu Kush mountain rangeand at the base of a drainage stream for the massive Chitral glaciers. While the risk of glacial flooding is regional, the vulnerabilities among Reshun's residents are far from equal, according to study authors Ishaq Khan and Inam Ullah Leghari, a graduate student and professor at the Department of Anthropology at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.

Members of Chitral's lowest serf class, cheermuzh, have long lived in stark marginalization. Now as glacial floods in Reshun grow more frequent due to climate change, low-income residents with little access to political power are left increasingly without options. The floods disproportionately devastate cheermuzh communities, and aid has been insufficient. As Hamna Tariq, a junior fellow in the South Asia program at the Stimson Center, told GlacierHub, ""They tough it out, until they cannot.""

Outside the polar regions, Pakistan is one of the world's major centers of glacial ice. Over 7,000 known glaciers lie within its borders and more than 500 of these glaciers are in the remote Chitral valley. The entire area is at risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are outpours of meltwater caused by glacial dam failure. However, exposure to GLOFs is highly varied and determined by one's social status.

Chitral society is divided into four classesthe highest of which is ""adamzade"" (proper human), and the lowest of which is a serf class, cheermuzh, often referred to as ""beizzat"" (without respect) and ""ghalamus"" (slave). True to a serfdom-like system, upper classes grant land to cheermuzh to live and farm on, which they retain by providing services to their landlords. This hierarchy is not just functional, but reflective of social attitudes toward low-status residents; a Chitral resident of lordly descent opposed the construction of a water pipe in his village on the grounds that he could not drink the same water as cheermuzh.

Like the village's social organization, vulnerabilities to glacial lake outburst floods are unequal and hierarchized. Reshun's cheermuzh communities reside by a stream flowing between two mountains. Flash floods linked to heavy rains and GLOFs annually devastate these communities.

The impacts of the 2013 and 2015 flash floods, in particular, illustrate their disproportionate effect on low-status residents. Khan and Leghari found that the 2013 Reshun flood's damage was concentrated in three mostly cheermuzh hamlets Panandeh, Batikandeh, and Golguch. Only families in these hamlets lost their homes or livestock, an important food source and financial asset. There were 23 fully damaged and 16 partially damaged houses. The flooding also destroyed the hamlets' drinking water supply line and the bridges connecting them to evacuation routes.

Though these low-status residents were stranded, help didn't come for days. Aid workers were even instructed not to go into the hamlets as a precautionary measure. One resident, Ashraf Khan, told the study authors how he and his family were forced to spend one week outside, unaided and unsheltered, after their home was destroyed.

Two years later, the flash floods were even worse. Nearly 100 houses were fully damaged, 86 of which belonged to low-status households, including Khan's. His family was one of 30 low-status households whose homes were destroyed twice, in both 2013 and 2015. As mentioned in the study, all of these households had rebuilt their homes in the same place, as they had nowhere else to live. On the other hand, five households whose homes were destroyed in the 2013 flood and who could afford to move elsewhere were unaffected in 2015.

The 2015 flood also completely washed away the road connecting the three hamlets to the main road. ""Flash flood isolated us from the rest of the world,"" said another resident, Sher Muhammad, who was quoted in the study. Now, not only were cheermuzh socially marginalized, but they were also physically isolated.

Muhammad is also involved in Golguch's anti-grazing movement. As glacial lake outburst floods have become more frequent, goat grazing near Reshun's nearby glaciers has become a controversial issue. According to anti-grazers, grazing intensifies flooding by breaking the soil surrounding the nearby glaciers. Khan, the graduate student who co-authored the article, wrote to GlacierHub that grazing is ""mostly supported by lordly families,"" who are not at the highest risk of flooding, while opponents of grazing are mostly from low-status backgrounds. This divide is indicative of the class-based vulnerabilities to GLOFs and the tensions that have risen as a result.

Without any prospect that GLOFs will subside in a warming climate, Reshun's cheermuzh residents are left without many options. Writing to GlacierHub, Hamna Tariq highlighted the need for government aid: ""Granted these regions are nestled between dangerous landscapes, more can still be done like providing better warning systems, immediate flood relief aid, temporary housing, and employment opportunities.""

The article's authors, Khan and Muhammad, emphasize the importance of addressing power structures in addition to the floods. They write that ""the effectiveness of mitigation and relief programs for such communities can only be achieved if the political structure of the past and its perpetual effect could be understood.""

As the study illustrates, Reshun residents like Ashraf Khan and Sher Muhammad face the severe dangers of glacial flooding due to no fault of their own, but as a result of their socioeconomic marginalization. The paper's conclusions affirm the need not only to address GLOF-related impacts, but also the class inequities that create these unequal vulnerabilities. Failing to address this two-fold crisis is to fail these residents and all others at the frontlines of climate change.

963,Drought Sri Lanka,A for Adyar - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-for-adyar/article4422191.ece,"Recognising their spiritual link with Adyar, Theosophists have chosen February 17 as Adyar Day. Joining in the celebration, Aparna Karthikeyan and Prince Frederick present some facts about the neighbourhood — some, perhaps, common knowledge, and others, little-known, beyond niche groups, anyway …

Well-known

For millions of people, mention of Adyar instantly brings to mind a banyan tree, frighteningly old and incredibly spread-out. Having sprouted roots around 450 years ago, this banyan, found inside the Theosophical Society, is among the world’s oldest trees. According to >adyarbanyantree.blogspot.in, its sprawl makes it the largest surviving banyan — yes, the largest — on the planet. “Its branches spread across 40,000 sq.ft.,” says the blog site.

Less-known

Within the Theosophical Society are found baobab trees, remarkably unique in look and feature. “Native to Africa, the baobab tree possesses a built-in capacity for withstanding drought-like conditions. It stores water in its huge trunk. It has a large base, which is offset by its small branches. The colour and texture of its bark bear a resemblance to the skin of an elephant,” says naturalist and sea turtle conservationist V. Arun.

In the 1950s, when Gandhi Nagar was being developed, the residents wanted a neighbourhood temple, and the last maharajah of Travancore (Chitra Tirunal Bala Rama Varma) helped in purchasing the land on which the Padmanabhaswamy temple was built. “In the 1990s — when the Travancore Maharaja Park (near Esplanade) became a bus terminus, and the statue reduced to a public convenience — Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and others, mooted the idea and moved the statue to its present location in the temple,” says Sriram.V, historian and Chennai chronicler.

Less-known

Chitra Tirunal Bala Rama Varma’s statue, that is currently at the Padmanabhaswamy temple, Gandhi Nagar, was originally opposite the Raja Annamalai Manram, says Sriram. “The statue was installed to commemorate his Temple Entry Proclaomation, which allowed all Hindus, irrespective of caste, to enter any temple in Travancore, and the pedestal stone was inscribed with the full text of the proclamation. In the movie En Manaivi, a car goes around George Town, and the statue can be seen in all its glory, in the old location,” he adds.

The conflux of sea and river water at the Adyar Estuary fosters bio-diversity. “The estuarine eco-system holds is an attraction for migratory birds, including godwits, redshanks, greenshanks, common sandpipers, golden plovers and little-ringed plovers,” says T. Murugavel, founder, the Trust for Environment Monitoring and Action Initiating (TEMAI).

“The Adyar Estuary has small islands or land masses that are overrun with Prosopis juliflora (velikaathan). These islands of green serve as nesting grounds for stone curlews, red-wattled lapwings and paddy field pipits. Often, small packs of jackals are also found there,” says Murugavel of TEMAI. “From the Broken Bridge, a clear view of these land masses is possible.”

Subramaniam Sivathai alias Thamalini was handed over to her parents at the Poonthottam Rehabilitation Centre in Vavuniya yesterday, said Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Brigadier Dharshana Hettiarachchi.

Thamalini from Kilinochchi had joined the LTTE in 1991 and became the head of LTTE women's Wing.

She was arrested by Sri Lankan army in May 2009 at an Army welfare centre for refugees and taken to Colombo for investigations.

Thereafter, she was held in the main Welikada prison and was charged with training LTTE cadres and establishing connections with Tamil Tigers overseas.

She was later transferred to the Vavuniya Rehabilitation centre to undergo the rehabilitation programme in order to re-integrate her into the society.

Thamalini received vocational training at the camp and had followed a training course in bridal dressing.

Opposition political sources said she may opt to become a ruling party candidate in the upcoming northern provincial council election in September.

1929,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Poor human activities aiding Butaleja floods - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/poor-human-activities-aiding-butaleja-floods-3394406,"By Yahudu Kitunzi More by this Author

Environmental experts and local leaders in Butaleja District have blamed the re-occurrence of floods to massive environmental degradation and lack of a political will to mitigate the effects of such disasters.

The experts say swamps and river banks of Manafwa and Nakwasi have been mismanaged by the locals due to poor agricultural methods.

They also blame the floods on failure by the government to erect embankments on River Manafwa and River Nakwasi and restore flood early warning systems.

The system, which stopped functioning in 2016, had been installed by the government in 2015 to alert locals of the rising water levels.

The concern comes following the occurrence of floods that hit the district on Friday, killing one person, destroying property worth millions of shillings and displacing many residents.

The yet unidentified resident was swept by water as he attempted to cross Nakwasi River in Leresi Cell.

Houses were submerged and household items such as beddings, clothes and crops were washed away by the ravaging floods triggered by the downpour from Mt Elgon. Transport was also paralysed and schools rendered inaccessible.

The most affected areas were Butaleja Town Council and Busolwe Town Council.

When Daily Monitor visited the affected areas, the displaced people were wandering without food, shelter, clothing, among other necessities.

The district has been experiencing back-to-back floods since 1976, and environmentalists further predict that this is likely to continue.

“Environmental degradation is rife in Butaleja District and it has been worsened by the laissez-faire approach to the disaster by authorities,” Mr James Wire, an agribusiness consultant, said.

“As of now, there are no visible efforts at an institutional level to stop this problem and it is worrying,” he added.

Mr Wire said there is a need for the district to enact by-laws that will protect the environment.

“Simple approaches such as requiring a permit before a tree is cut down in public or private land may seem harsh but bear fruits in the long run,” he said, adding that residents should be given seedlings to plant trees on the river banks.

The chairperson of Masulula “B” Village in Himutu Sub-county, Mr Mesulamu Wabaye, said there is limited land and this has forced the populace to encroach on what should be the green spaces, especially the swamps.

Ms Lamula Were, the district senior environmental officer, said the situation has been worsened by locals erecting residential houses on the river banks while others are farming and quarrying near the rivers.

“People should stop digging up to the river banks. Butaleja District is on a low land area,” she said.

Ms Were said about 60 per cent of wetlands in the district have been encroached on. She, however, said the environmental law will not spare those who are encroaching on the wetlands.

She said the district environment office has started implementing a presidential directive to restore wetlands.

Encroachment

Mr Higenyi Kemba, a resident and an opinion leader, said the main cause of the floods is human encroachment.

“Human encroachment around the river banks causes heavy silting that fills up the river bed, hence reducing the size of the waterway. When this happens, the route that water should take becomes shallow,” Mr Kemba said.

Mr Kemba said people should plant bamboo trees on either side of the river banks all the way from Bugisu Sub-region to Butaleja and Bugwere.

“Bamboo trees will stop the silting. When this is done, the deposits already in the river can then be removed...,” he said.

Mr Moses Wegulo, a resident, said repeated floods have affected them, especially in terms of food security and road network.

For example since this year started, the district has been hit by floods four times leaving hundreds of people homeless.

“This road from Mbale-Butaleja-Busolwe, which is the main link between the two districts is always cut off by floods,” he said.

Ms Madina Hifudde, another resident of Butaleja, said the affected families need urgent financial and moral support.

“We appeal to the government and other non-governmental organisations to intervene because the situation is bad,” Ms Hifudde said.

The chairperson-elect for Butaleja District, Mr Michael Higenyi Bory, said about 15,000 families have been affected by floods.

He said the crops destroyed include rice, sweet potatoes and cassava.

“We request the government to intervene and help our people. We need shelter and food,” he said.

The district environmental officer, Mr Tom Wandera, said the district is making an assessment report to submit to the Office of the Prime Minister for assistance to the affected families.

“We ask our people who are in flood-prone areas to relocate to safer places as we wait for any assistance from the government,” Mr Wandera said.

He said they have gazetted Doho Rice Scheme offices and some schools for people who have been displaced.

The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Stanly Bayole, said the government has the political will and it’s aware of the damage caused by floods.

19,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Climate change will widen the social and health gap - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/climate-change-will-widen-social-and-health-gap/,"Climate projections suggest that, thanks to human activity, we will likely see an increase in extreme weather events, disruptions to agriculture, loss of livelihoods and displacement of people.

While everyone will be affected, these climate impacts will exacerbate social and health inequities, depending on underlying economic, geographic, social and health status.

Recently there’s been increasing attention on climate change and health, including calls from Australian scientists, led by Professor Peter Doherty, for the government to put climate change on the G20 agenda.

My research focuses on social inequality, and how that might exacerbate climate changes impact on health inequalities, including vulnerability to extreme weather and rising food prices. I presented some of the latest research on this topic at a recent Australian Academy of Science symposium on climate and health.

Inequities of man-made natural disasters

Low-lying cities and towns near coasts are facing increased risks from more frequent and more intense cyclones. These storms can generate storm surges causing flooding, direct injury and damage to infrastructure, including housing, water and sanitation systems.

Poorer households are usually at higher direct health risk due to weaker structures, less safe locations and building sites, and the weaker resilience of infrastructure in poorer cities and towns to withstand damage.

At the end of 2013, the Philippines were hit by devastating super typhoon Haiyan, which affected 16 million people. 6,069 people were reported dead while 4.1 million people were displaced, with 1.1 million houses damaged or destroyed. While everyone was touched by the typhoon, large income inequalities meant that poorer people not only lived in poorer quality housing, they were also more likely to be living on cheaper land in vulnerable low-lying regions.

Poorer households also often lack the economic resources to evacuate in the face of climate-related disasters, or to rebuild. The ﬂooding of New Orleans in 2005 gave a striking example of what can happen among socially disadvantaged communities. Elderly patients in homes and poor people could not evacuate in front of the storm because of lack of transport.

We see similar issues with heatwaves. Lower socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are more likely to live and work in warmer neighbourhoods and in buildings that are poorly ventilated and absorb heat. This increases the risk of heat stress and heat deaths.

Poor neighbourhoods with weak infrastructure, buildings and unplanned developments with little green spaces are likely to be more exposed to high temperatures compared to more affluent neighbourhoods.

Impacts on agriculture

“ In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

Our agricultural systems are also under threat. Increasing drought periods in Australia may challenge the viability of agriculture in some regions, and hence those communities that depend on primary production. This will affect people’s income, stress levels and sense of hope.

In 2003 bushfires ravaged eastern Victoria, destroying more than 40 homes and killing thousands of cattle. But the bushfires exacerbated problems already present in the community, typical of other rural Australian communities. Economic and climate pressures on rural farming communities has created financial hardship, led to closures in local businesses, and young people moving away.

This has transformed the social landscape and support that is often present within rural communities. These factors we know have real implications for mental health and may increase risk of suicidal thoughts.

Climate change also exacerbates food insecurity. Modelling estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2007 there was a 33 per cent increase in the price of vegetables and a 43 per cent increase in fruit prices in Australia because of the drought and extreme weather events.

Rising food prices most affect the poor — as a proportion of total household expenditure, food makes up an average of around 19 per cent. But, with 12 per cent of Australians living below the poverty line, these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many Australians face.

Climate pressures will widen the food gap between those able to maintain a healthy diet of fresh produce, fish, lean meat and so on, and those needing to find the cheapest sources of calories. Cheap calories are found in the most highly processed, long shelf-life products, containing hardened fats and bulk starches, preserved with sugar or salt.

Where does inequality come from?

Climate change throws into sharp relief many of the issues to do with inequities in living standards, resource use, levels of exposure to environmental stresses, and existing health inequities.

Australians who are more socially disadvantaged (by income, employment status, education) and Indigenous Australians are more likely to die younger and have a higher risk of depression, diabetes, heart disease and cancers.

Parts of our cities are marked by concentrations of long term unemployment, low levels of education, and poor and dangerous housing conditions, leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes. The health experience of people living in rural and remote Australia is often worse than the urban average.

Climate change itself is a product of the same forces that have created inequality in different groups of people. In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

The best way to address the unequal effects of climate change is address the causes of climate change and inequality. This might include: fairer and more sustainable food systems; affordable quality housing; pensions and benefits set no lower than the poverty line and indexed to average wages; and the establishment of more quality job creation programs in priority areas.

This will not only improve health, but advances will be made in social equity such that communities and nations will be better able to resist current climate change and avert further damage to the environment.

Mum-of-two Caroline Chapman, 33, passed away on April 11 in the African country, where she lived with her British Army serviceman husband Harry.

2 Caroline Chapman passed away on April 11

Caroline, from Glenrothes, Fife, had been staying with her family in the capital Nairobi since December and she had been volunteering at an orphanage, home to disabled children.

Money she has left behind is to be donated towards the orphanage.

Her death has left her family and friends devastated as one of her loved ones paid tribute to Caroline who was ""popular and well-liked"".

Speaking to The Scottish Sun, they said: ""Caroline's always been very helpful and used to care for old people. She would want any spare money to go to the charity.

""She was completely loving life there and having the time of her life. They experienced so much of the culture out there and got a lot done in such a short time.

""She was really outgoing and had lots of friends from places she'd been that she kept in touch with. She was really popular and well-liked.""

2 Caroline had been staying in the country with her husband Harry, right, and their two young sons

Caroline, who had four siblings, passed away after a tragic car crash near their home, as her and Harry headed back from a holiday trip.

Her loved one said: ""It was just devastating. A complete shock. No one really took it well - it was really stressful.

""She was the best mum. Even lots of people would look to her and say 'I want to be a mum like that'.

""She was a very involved mum and the main caretaker for her boys. She was the most caring person and the life of the party - just really caring and kind.""

A fundraiser has been launched to help raise funds for a professional biography to be made about Caroline's life for Harry, her two boys, Harley, six, and Callum, ten, and the rest of her family and friends.

In just four days since the fundraiser was started, £8,269 has been raised towards a £10,000 target, and any money left over from the biography costs will go towards Harley and Callum.

Her loved one said: ""They're going to make a book about her life for her children because they're quite young, with people's stories about Caroline and pictures.

""Friends and family members will all get a copy. There will be pictures from Caroline's early childhood to her adulthood.

(File) The IMD has forecast an increase in the rainfall activity over Mumbai in the first week of July. (File)

After a break of a week, rain in Mumbai commenced over the weekend. In 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on Sunday, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Santacruz observatory recorded 27.2 mm of rainfall, which falls in the moderate category. Colaba station recorded 2.2 mm of rain. It, however, did not rain on Sunday.

The IMD has forecast an increase in the rainfall activity over Mumbai in the first week of July. The intensity of rain is likely to increase around July 3 and 5, it said.

As per IMD’s 24-hour forecast, the city will witness thundershowers at a few places and moderate rainfall on Monday. Its district rainfall forecast says that for the next four days, light to moderate rain is expected in the city and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Meanwhile, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg are very likely to receive heavy rain at isolated places on Monday and Tuesday.

So far, there has been only one intense spell of rain on June 18 in Mumbai – after the IMD declared monsoon onset in the city – leading to 41 mm rain in the suburbs and 44 mm in south Mumbai. After that only sporadic showers, mostly during the night or early morning, have been witnessed.

The southwest monsoon officially covered Mumbai on June 14, but the city is yet to witness a continuous downpour.

The total rainfall recorded so far since June 1 is 344.4 mm, which is 105.7 mm below the monthly average. According to the state-wise rainfall distribution between June 1 and June 24, Akola and Yavatmal districts have recorded deficient rainfall.

The southwest Monsoon had covered the entire country on Friday. Though the formation of cyclone Nisarga in the Arabian Sea posed a threat and had potential to delay the monsoon progress from Maharashtra onwards north, it was not realised, said IMD.",2020-06-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['imd', 'increase', 'rain', 'mumbai', 'forecast', 'monsoon', 'week', 'mm', 'recorded', 'rainfall']",India,news article,English

Scorecard and ball-by-ball details

Tillakaratne Dilshan hit his fourth ODI century of the year AFP

Early in the evening, BJ Watling missed his century by four runs but returned to the pavilion with a spring in his step after propelling New Zealand to a competitive total in difficult circumstances, with rain curtailing the game to 33 overs a side. Tillakaratne Dilshan not only passed three figures, but also ensured Sri Lanka passed the finish line without panic in a controlled chase.

The two innings were statistically similar - in terms of strike-rate and number of boundaries hit - but the difference lay in the way they were paced. Watling came alive after he passed fifty, while Dilshan built his innings steadily and pushed on once his partnership with Angelo Mathews had all but ensured Sri Lanka to safety.

New Zealand had scored 188, but the target was revised to 197. The chase began positively with Dilshan finding the gaps early on, but New Zealand hit back in the fifth over. After being caressed for two boundaries through the off side, Tim Southee bowled a bouncer and Upul Tharanga ducked and the ball deflected off his helmet for four. Southee exchanged words with the batsman but Tharanga barely had time to gather himself when he hooked the following ball - dug in short again - awkwardly to fine leg.

The challenge for the New Zealand bowlers was the heavy dew and their seamers did well to keep it tight and not let the likes of Kumar Sangakkara to get away. In the urge to find the boundary, Sangakkara chipped down the track to Kyle Mills and pulled straight to midwicket. It wasn't Mahela Jayawardene's night either, as his reverse sweep off Nathan McCullum found short third man, giving New Zealand an opening in the 15th over with Sri Lanka needing 124.

The boundaries had dried up for the hosts and the drought lasted eight overs before Mathews charged Southee and swatted him over mid-on. The required rate crept up to seven and beyond but Dilshan and Mathews ensured things didn't get out of hand, perhaps gaining a psychological edge watching the bowlers furiously wipe the ball trying to get rid of the dew. The fielders showed good commitment, sliding and diving with purpose but the bowlers couldn't sustain the pressure, giving away regular boundaries.

Dilshan crashed one on the up and nearly cleaned up the bowler Trent Boult, before Mathews slapped two ordinary deliveries from Mills wide of point in a three-over period that produced a vital 30 runs. It was a matter of time before Dilshan produced his trademark lap shot, sending one off Jacob Oram to fine leg. Sri Lanka took their last Powerplay block of three overs in the end, when Dilshan muscled his way towards his century, reaching the landmark with a six over deep square leg.

Sri Lanka were fortunate their innings wasn't constantly interrupted by the weather. Two lengthy rain interruptions - both exceeding 100 minutes each - couldn't have been easy for New Zealand as they looked to build after being put in to bat. After the second break, they had 19 remaining overs to get as many as they could, with the threat of rain at the back of their heads.

The stand of 56 between James Franklin and Watling gave New Zealand the push they needed. Watling had nothing to lose in attacking. His first fifty came of 70 balls - his next 46 came off just 18. It included slogs to midwicket off the spinners, powerful drives to the deep square on the off side off the seamers and three boundaries in an over off Lasith Malinga. That over - the penultimate - yielded 15, as Malinga dished out low full tosses. It was one of those nights when he couldn't land his yorkers. Nathan McCullum gave him good support at the other end with clean hits.

A century for Watling seemed a possibility but he lost strike after the third ball in the final over. New Zealand had made enough to set Sri Lanka a required rate of just under a run-a-ball, but Dilshan and Mathews settled the issue with nearly two overs to spare and give Sri Lanka an unassailable 2-0 lead.",2012-11-06 08:00:00+00:00,"['zealand', 'watling', 'ball', 'ton', 'overs', 'lanka', 'sri', '20', 'mathews', 'century', 'boundaries', 'dilshan', 'lead', 'gives']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The agency's spokesman Raditya Jati said the floods are still inundating houses in Pasuruan district.



""The water level now is around 20 to 50 centimeters high. Yesterday it reached 80 centimeters high,"" Jati noted.



He said it rained heavily on Friday, causing the Wrati, Patuk, and Kedung Larangan rivers to overflow.



As of Friday 11,880 people had been displaced, and some have returned homes now.



On Saturday (April 3), the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency said that there were two tropical cyclones namely 90S in the Indian Ocean southwest of Sumatra Island and 99S in the Savu Sea, East Nusa Tenggara.



""Both the tropical cyclones will strengthen in the next 24 hours,"" the agency's deputy for Meteorology Guswanto said.



The agency warned of heavy rainstorms and strong winds in most parts of Indonesia for the next week. - Xinhua

2213,FL-2017-000067-BRA,"Migrations, flood and epidemics put Acre (Brazil) in a state of emergency - Emergency-Live",https://www.emergency-live.com/news/migration-crisis-flood-and-epidemics-put-acre-brazil-in-a-state-of-emergency/,"Brazil, a series of recent events has led the state of Acre to face an unprecedented situation.

Since the beginning of 2021, the number of dengue cases has exploded in the region, which already has more than 8,600 suspected cases.

In the last week, rains have caused rivers and streams to overflow, dislodged families in more than 10 cities.

Added to this, the second wave of Covid-19 affected the state, which suffers from a lack of ICU beds, and an unexpected humanitarian crisis involving hundreds of immigrants aggravates the scenario.

The governor of Acre (Brazil), Gladson Cameli, decreed an emergency situation and installed a temporary crisis office to manage the situation

Among the measures that the federal government announced to mitigate the floods is the release of R$ 450 million for several municipalities.

The Ministry of Justice, on the other hand, authorized the use of the National Security Force in the state, in “exceptional and temporary blocking activities of foreigners entering the country”.

President Jair Bolsonaro said he intends to go to Rio Branco, capital of Acre, next Wednesday (24).

Immigrants trying to cross into Peru, whose borders are closed because of the pandemic, are increasing tensions in the city of Assis Brasil.

Right now, more than 400 immigrants, mostly Haitians, are in shelters or camped on the streets.

The possibility of increasing this migratory flow is worrying, since the city does not have the capacity to serve so many people and the agglomeration further increases the risk of contamination by coronavirus.

According to the State Department of Health (Sesacre), Acre has 54,743 covid-19 infected and 957 deaths. The ICU bed occupancy rate rose to 91%, and is concentrated in the two largest cities, Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul.

Assis Brasil leads the ranking of covid contamination rate in the state, with 1,375 cases per 10,000 inhabitants.

Acre (Brazil): the state of emergency is expected to extend in the coming days due to rain forecast until February 25

Acre already has almost 130,000 people affected in some way by the flood of rivers in the capital and in the interior of the state. Residents affected by the floods were taken to shelters set up in schools, churches, gymnasiums, sports courts and boats.

Floods further increase the risk of dengue.

120,DR-2015-000134-SOM,6 Places Destroyed By Communism Often Blamed On The West And Capitalism - The Libertarian Republic,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/6-places-destroyed-by-communism-often-blamed-on-the-west-and-capitalism/,"Ethiopia

In 1974 a Marxist-Leninist military junta called the Derg seized power in Ethiopia, disposing Dictator Haile Selassie. A one-party communist state was established named the People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The new regime suffered several coups and uprisings, while battling a major drought and a refugee crisis. A brief war with Somalia was won with the aid of the USSR and its allies. The resulting Red Terror was a government retribution campaign of forced deportations, torture, and starvation which claimed nearly half a million lives. In the 1980’s a series of famines which claimed another one million lives led to uprisings against the communist regime. When anti-communist revolutions swept Eastern Europe and communism began to collapse, aid from the USSR ceased. The regime was toppled in 1991, and in 2006 its leader Mengistu Haile Mariam was convicted of in Ethiopian courts of genocide.

Albania

Prior to World War II Albania was invaded and occupied by fascist Italy. When the Axis Powers were defeated, the anti-fascism movement inside Albania had taken on a socialist banner and would fight to establish The People’s Socialist Republic of Albania. After breaking with Yugoslavia in 1948, Albania became dependent on the Soviet Union for aid. The Soviet super-state subsidized economically failing nations like Albania by extracting from other territories. Like most Soviet states, Albania suffered poverty and hardship under socialist rule. Little Albania then became a political pawn in a game between the Chinese and the Soviets, resulting in a distanced relationship with the Soviet Union as Albania became part of China’s sphere of influence. Albania’s socialist government collapsed in 1990, leading to an untenable situation of social strife and desperate conditions. Massive emigration followed, as the strife led to armed conflict in 1997. Despite a rocky road and scandal that marred their first attempt at a democratic government, Albania established another democratic government in 1998 and have slowly been making their way out of the dark ages that socialism left them in.

Somalia

In 1969 the assassination of Somali President Abdi Rashid Ali Shermarke set up a military coup. The new government under Major General Mohamed Siad Barre aligned itself with the Soviet Union. In 1976 the regime created the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party under guidance from the USSR. Soon after they backed a group of Ethiopian revolutionaries, which led to war with Ethiopia. The war was over quickly, Somalia was defeated, and much of its army was destroyed. Having backed a rebellion against an Soviet ally in Ethiopia, Barre was isolated. Struggling with poverty, Barre signed a deal with the International Monetary Fund for aid in the 1980’s which required the privatization of some industries and the end of government monopolies on others. However, as the Cold War drew to an end, the importance of Somalia was diminished to major world players. Barre became increasingly more despotic as the nation grew more isolated. In 1991 civil war broke out leading to Barre’s exile. Under Soviet rule, Somalia became one of the poorest places on the planet, with malnutrition and starvation plaguing the country. To this day it has been unable to recover.

Venezuela

If there is one modern state which best exemplifies the damaging effects of socialism, it’s Venezuela. Modeling after Latin American revolutionary icon Simon Bolivar’s brand of Marxist-Leninism, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez fashioned what is now known as Chavismo, a socialist ideology combined with traditional Latin American Machismo, namely strong, paternal, masculine leadership. Corruption plagued the Chavez regime, as he used intimidation and violence to silence his opponents, held dubious elections, and made alliances with rogue nations like Iran and Cuba. Despite being the largest exporter of oil in the world, Venezuela faces unfathomable poverty. Chavez was obsessed with the failed communist experiment that is Cuba, subsidizing the impoverished island with oil revenues. Chavez oversaw a nationalized oil operation worth untold billions of dollars while the people of Venezuela starved from food shortages. It was common to have millions of dollars unaccounted for, fueling corruption charges. Chavez and the communists of Venezuela maintained they were for the people, most specifically the poor. However, their economic controls have caused misery, famine, disease, and death. Though Chavez died in March of 2013, his successor Nicholas Maduro continued the Chavismo legacy of suffering and despair. Revolutionary movements are growing in resistance, as the government fails to provide its people with basic needs such as food and toilet paper. Recently, the government began finger printing shoppers as a way to combat the black market sale of food. Until the communist are overthrown, they will continue to spend billions from oil revenues to prop up the Venezuelan and Cuban militaries while people starve in the streets.

Cambodia

The Khmer Rouge is infamous for carrying out one of the most vicious genocides of modern history. They did so in the pursuit of a socialist utopia. The bombing of Cambodia as part of the Vietnam War effort by the United States helped contribute to the destabilization of the Cambodian government, which would eventually fall to the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot. Seeking to establish an agrarian socialist society of working class Cambodians, the new regime quickly set upon purging the population. Those with money, foreigners, and those with too much education like doctors and teachers were executed in Pot’s killing fields. The Khmer Rouge had declared it to be Year Zero, society needed to start over, in the fields, and all knowledge of the outside world needed to be purged as well. Even people wearing glasses were killed, as they were seen as intellectuals. Nearly one third of their population was culled in the Cambodian genocide, around 300,000 individuals.

Afghanistan

It is strange to consider that prior to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan the country was budding with Western fashion, nice cars, vacationing Europeans, and commerce. Secularism ruled as boys and girls interacted freely and went to Western style universities to pursue higher knowledge. That all changed when the Soviet Union invaded, causing a 10 year war Afghanistan would never recover from. The war radicalized Muslim leaders inside the nation, who were then armed and trained by the US to counter the Soviet occupation. When the Soviets withdrew in 1989, the radical Sunni Muslim fighters were seen as heroes. The country has never been the same, embracing radical Islam over Western culture, which ultimately led to war with the US following the attacks of September 11th, 2001. Clerics, tribal leaders, and drug lords now run roughshod over Afghanistan. Many blame the US for the troubles now plaguing the nation, however, it was the Soviet war machine that came to Afghanistan for its resources which caused the radicalization that has retrogressed the society to the place we see it today.

CAIRO – 25 August 2018: The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation worked on finishing the preparations for winter rains and downpours by carrying out a plan to check the pumping stations, clear canals, water banks and storm drains.



Mohamed Abdel Aati, an official in the ministry, said that the preparation plan included maintenance of all pumping stations nationwide to be ready for sudden rains.

The ministry installed more than 25 emergency units in West Delta near the critical areas, to avoid the recurrence of the 2015 floods.



Khaled Madin, head of the ministry's Irrigation Department said that flood protection projects have been executed, in addition to the projects that have already been accomplished, including 119 dams, about 16 man-made lakes, about 500 underground rainwater tanks, and five channels.



For her part, Nadia Abdel Hamid, a ministry's official, said that a series of flood control projects have been accomplished. The projects included the establishment of numerous man-made lakes, and dams.







In September, Agriculture Minister Ezzedin Abu Stait urged all bodies concerned to take the necessary measures to face possible floods with the beginning of the winter season.

State bodies are always coordinating efforts to better deal with heavy rains and floods and prevent any harm to citizens or damage to their property and crops, Abu Stait said in statements.



Hassan el-Fouly, the director of the General Authority for Agrarian Reform, said directorates in Behaira, Alexandria, Beni Sweif, Fayyoum, Minya, Assiut, Sohag, Luxor and Aswan are urged to coordinate efforts with the Irrigation Ministry to handle the floods, clean canals and make sure warehouses are fit to store production equipment.

Last month, the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, in cooperation with the South Sinai governor, inaugurated a project that built a cement barrier to push floodwater into a man-made lake in al-Ismabiya to save city houses from flood risks.



Over the past two years, the government built a number of lakes and barriers to protect South Sinai, especially Taba, from flood risks. In 2014, several hotels in Taba drowned by floods.

The floods, which hit Egypt’s Saint Catherine over the past two days, resulted in the accumulation of around 10,000 cubic meters of floodwater, said the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation.

Across the state of Amazonas, more than 400,000 people have been affected by flooding, said the state's Civil Defense service, many of whom were evacuated as water levels climbed.

The Rio Negro river was rising by about 3 centimeters (1 inch) a day and on Monday streets in the center of Manaus were already under water, according to city hall.

""The water level is... the third highest in the history of the city. If it continues like this, it will pass the record 2012 flood,"" said mayoral spokesman Emerson Quaresma.

While rainfall varies from year to year, climate change has brought particularly heavy rainy years and also very dry years that hurt farming, said Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus. Amazon deforestation may also contribute to long-term changes but does not impact rainfall year to year, he said.

Access to the Manaus market on the edge of the Rio Negro is underwater and the city has built raised wooden walkways for pedestrians.

Up the Amazon River, small riverside towns such as Anamã, population 12,700, have been totally flooded, forcing residents to raise the floor levels of their wooden houses or evacuate.

In Manaus, the homes of 4,700 families are in danger. Mayor David Almeida has offered them stipends to rent other dwellings if they are forced to evacuate.

Late last year, Manaus became an epicenter of the pandemic, making headlines as the city's hospital system ran out of oxygen for patients.

The city and surrounding region registered the first cases of a highly contagious variant of coronavirus, called P.1, that has spread rapidly throughout Brazil and to at least 10 other countries.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

OUT AND ALL OUT! Lasith Malinga nails another yorker and this time hits the base of Hamid Hassan's middle stump. Afghanistan all out for 152, Sri Lanka wins by 34 runs on DLS method.

WICKET! That could be the clincher for Sri Lanka! Dimuth Karunaratne, fielding at cover, attacks the ball and hits the bull's eye, Najibullah Zadran is caught short of his crease and Sri Lanka can celebrate. Najibullah's gone for 43 with Afghanistan 145 for nine after 32 overs. Lasith Malinga continues.

One run, via a wide, off the 31st over. Afghanistan 136 for eight. Sri Lanka, thanks to some accurate bowling, is inching closer to its first win of the tournament. Isuru Udana comes into the attack.

WICKET! Lasith Malinga nails his yorker and it's too good for Dawlat Zadran. It swings in and hits the base of middle stump. Dawlat is dismissed for 6, Afghanistan 136 for eight. Hamid Hassan is the new batsman in.

Just two runs off the 30th over, Afghanistan 135 for seven, needs a further 52 runs in 11 overs. Lasith Malinga's into the attack.

Three runs off the 29th over, Afghanistan 133 for seven, needs a further 54 runs in 12 overs. Najibullah Zadran didn't want to expose Dawlat Zadran for four deliveries from Nuwan Pradeep.

Three singles from the 28th over, Afghanistan 130 for seven, needs a further 57 runs in 13 overs. Dawlat Zadran has defended well since walking in at the fall of Rashid Khan's wicket, but Najibullah Zadran holds the key to this match. The ball is nipping around if the bowlers hit the length and Afghanistan has a stiff task in its hand. Nuwan Pradeep continues, into his ninth over.

Four runs off the 27th over, Afghanistan 127 for seven. Another successful over from Nuwan Pradeep and the four off the blade of Dawlat Zadran could have been avoided. It was a forward push that should have been stopped by Lasith Malinga at mid-on. An untimely slip and the ball, despite the best efforts of Angelo Mathews, races to the boundary. Afghanistan needs 60 more runs from 14 overs. Suranga Lakmal's into the attack.

WICKET! Rashid Khan is bowled for 2, Nuwan Pradeep's the bowler again. This one straightens after pitch and Rashid is neither forward nor back to play it. Afghanistan 123 for seven, and you've got to say, it's advantage Sri Lanka at this stage. Dawlat Zadran is the new batsman in.

End of the 25th over, Afghanistan is 122 for six, needs a further 65 runs from 16 overs. Pradeep delivers a wicket after conceding five wides and leave the match hanging in the balance again. Sri Lanka needs another wicket, though, to tilt the balance of the match.

WICKET! Nuwan Pradeep traps Gulbadin Naib with a ball that nips back in sharply and hits the batsman on the kneeroll. Umpire Paul Wilson signals out, but Naib reviews and DRS says it's umpire's call. Gone for 23, Afghanistan 121 for six. Rashid Khan is the new batsman in.

Seven runs off the 24th over — Afghanistan needs 73 more runs from 17 overs — which ends with Najibullah Zadran reverse-sweeping Dhananjaya de Silva for a four to the backward point region. Najibullah had to dive and hope that Lasith Malinga didn't hit the stumps direct, after hesitating for a single, but he nervelessly middles the ball keep the momentum going for Afghanistan. Nuwan Pradeep continues.

18 overs left, Afghanistan needs 80 more runs to win. Gulbadin Naib and Najibullah Zadran look settled and don't have the pressure of run rate, too. Sri Lanka bowlers need to be patient and keep bowling the right lines and lengths, with the pitch offering plenty of assistance. Off-spinner Dhananjaya de Silva's into the attack.

Naib brings up the team 100 with a brace to deep backward square leg. Udana is back into the attack. Six runs from that over. Afghanistan needs 82 runs to win.

Naib keeping Afghanistan in the hunt. Two back-to-back fours off Malinga but Perera keeps the duo quiet: just three runs off it. Suranga Lakmal is back into the attack.

10:10 pm: Najibullah Zadran isn't going down without a fight: he hammers two boundaries off one over. Eight from the over. Afghanistan needs 114 runs to win.

10:03 pm: And Nabi follows suit, Perera cleans him up. Najibullah Zadran at the crease. Three runs and a wicket from it.

9:59 pm: Another one bites the dust, and Sri Lanka's in command now. Pradeep grabs his second wicket, snaps up Shahidi for four. AFG 57/4 after 13 overs. Gulbadin Naib is in next. A wicket maiden that.

9:50 pm: Fifty comes up for Sri Lanka in the 11th over. Nabi pulls Pradeep over mid-on's head to bring up the first boundary in 40 balls. AFG: 51/3 in 11 overs

10 overs done with and Afghanistan needs 141 runs in 31 overs.

Udana's figures so far: 3-0-6-1

9:41 pm: Nuwan Pradeep comes into the attack and immediately gets into the act! Zazai goes for the pull and can only top edge it to the fine leg boundary. Thisara Perera comes in and takes a splendid, low catch. Mohammed Nabi walks in at no. 5. AFG: 44/3 in 9 overs

End of powerplay overs

9:38 pm: Udana bowling a good spell here as Sri Lanka pulls things back a bit. Udana keeps bowling in the fourth stump line and manages to get a thick edge of Rahmat's bat. Matthews is on hand to snaffle that catch. Afghanistan two down! Hashmatullah Shahidi comes in.

9:26 pm: Isuru Udana comes on and doesn't let Zazai clear his front leg to get under the ball. Just three single from his first over. AFG: 37/1 in 6 overs

9:22 pm: DROPPED! Malinga isn't impressed. Zazai pulls one high into the air and the deep-midwicket fielder Kusal Mendis floors it! WICKET! Shahzad isn't too lucky, however. He balloons a slower ball straight into the hands of Karunaratne at short mid-wicket and departs for 7. Rahmat Shah is the new batsman. SL: 34/1 in 5 overs

9:13 pm: Zazai with some ferocious striking here! Malinga over pitches and gets the rough treatment before Lakmal errs in line, too. He dispatches those deliveries and the ball reaches the boundary in no time. AFG: 29/0 in 4 overs

9:03 pm: Pick that one out! Hazratullah Zazai with the sweetest of connections to that lofted shot over deep mid-wicket! It was in the slot from Lakmal for the southpaw and he accepts the invitation. Shahzad, too, joins the party with a back-footed punch through the point region for a four. AFG: 17/0 in 2 overs

8.59 pm: Malinga gets started against Mohammad Shahzad. Six runs in the opening over to start the chase. AFG: 6/0 in 1 over

Afghanistan's innings

Mohammed Nabi on his career-best four-wicket figures: ""The pitch had nothing for spinners. I tried best to bowl with the conditions. I tried to turn and get some loop from my deliveries. It was also very good for me to bowl against many left handers. I set to a plan and tried to bowl my best in right areas with a slip to new batsman.""

Afghanistan's revised target after DLS is 187 in 41 overs. (Correction)

8:43 pm: Too good for the no.11 batsman from Rashid. A leg spinner on the line of the middle and off, Pradeep misses and the ball hits the top of off-stump! SL: 201 all-out. Rashid finishes with two wickets.

Rashid Khan to no. 11 Nuwan Pradeep as 200 comes up for Sri Lanka.

8:38 pm: Lakmal showing some intent, too. Dawlat making the error by bowling short, allowing Lakmal to hang back waiting and hit it baseball style over mid-wicket and mid-on regions for boundaries. WICKET! Dawlat responds better by bowling a back of the hand slower ball yorker and Malinga misses it to have his stumps shattered. SL: 199/9 in 36 overs

8:32 pm: Malinga comes out flying... with the bat. Makes room and slaps a Dawlat short delivery over mid-off. SL 189/8 in 34 overs

Statsman Mohandas Menon says, ""If Afghanistan can restrict/dismiss Sri Lanka to about 200 runs, then its target will be 186 in 41 overs."" I think Afghanistan will take that score.

MATCH TO RESUME AT 4 PM LOCAL TIME (8:30 IST). 41 overs per side with a 10-minute innings break.

The rain has picked up here and the umpires call for the covers. The players are walking off the field with Afghanistan well and truly on top in this contest after a roller-coaster passage of play in the last one hour.

The covers are finally coming off.

7:40 pm: Lunch has been taken in Cardiff. Good news at last: it has stopped raining and the groundsmen are busy draining the water off the ground.

6:52 pm: It is still drizzling and covers are in place.

6:24 pm: Bad news fellas... it's still raining in Cardiff. We haven't lost overs yet, yet being the operative word here. But we will in another 20 minutes.

5:32 pm: Deary me... Kusal Perera tries to reverse sweep Afghanistan's best bowler Rashid Khan and the ball gets an edge of his glove and its an easy grab for Shahzad! He departs for 78. Malinga is out in the middle and it seems like he doesn't want to hang around too long either. He was nearly run-out and stumped off consecutive deliveries. SL: 182/8 in 33 overs

Angelo Matthews now has three ducks in World Cups, the joint-most for Sri Lanka alongside Mahela Jayawardena and Arjuna Ranatunga.

5:24 pm: WICKET! Dawlat Zadran bowls a fast, full delivery and Isuru Udana's slog doesn't connect get bat on ball and is castled for 10! Perera will be left seething at the other end with that effort from his partner. Surunga Lakmal is the new batsman. SL: 179/7 in 32 overs

Perera, somehow, manages to remain unscathed amidst all the carnage at the other end.He is batting on 75 off 67 balls.

5:02 pm: The Perera's do manage to get a run-out among them. *insert hands on head emoji* Thisara taps it to cover and takes off but Kusal stays put. Hashmatullah Shahidi is quick to the ball and releases it to Shahzad, who collects the ball and disturbs the stumps to leave Thisara short of his crease. SL: 159/6 in 26 overs

4:59 pm: Sri Lanka is losing its heads here. Now, there is confusion in running between the wickets between Kusal and Thisara Perera, which nearly runs the former out. A direct hit would have had him. SL: 155/5 in 25 overs

This is the first time Nabi has claimed four wickets in his career.

11 balls bring five runs for Sri Lanka and four wickets for Afghanistan! Maddening stuff this!

4:50 pm: The conditions are still overcast and Hamid Hassan finds his groove again with the ball. Dhananjaya nicks one behind and Shahzad snaffles it! What on earth is happening! Four wickets in 11 balls and Sri Lanka is on the mat! SL: 149/5 in 23 overs

Dhananjaya de Silva is the new batsman at no. 6.

4:37 pm: WICKET! It's Nabi again! A nothing shot from Thirimanne as he tries to drag a ball spinning away to the leg side but only manages to inside edge it on to his stumps. Kusal Mendis falls cheaply again! After getting a sneaky edge of his bat from the first ball, he bowls a similar delivery next up and Mendis prods at it with a big stride, gets an edge to first slip. Angelo Matthews is the new man and he is on his way back too! Nabi, you beauty! Matthews pokes one on the back foot and he only manages to edge it to first slip. What is going on here at Cardiff?! SL: 146/4 in 22 overs

HUGEEEEE NEWS coming in! South Africa pacer Dale Steyn is ruled out of the World Cup and will be replaced by Reeza Hendricks.

4:31 pm: Sri Lanka has brought up the best start at the end of 20 overs so far in the World Cup and is set for a big total. SL: 139/1 in 20 overs

Staggering stat shown by the official broadcaster. Sri Lanka has used 57 different players and has had five different captains in ODIs since the 2015 World Cup.

4:20 pm: Naib with another no ball and follows it up with two wides to Perera. Shehzad tries to change the field but the umpire Nigel Llong tells him he can't do that. Naib bowls one in the slot and Perera lofts it over covers to bring up his fifty! The southpaw in the process ends his 21-ball boundary drought. Really poor stuff from Naib as he bowls another no-ball in the over and Perera accepts the free hit with another hit to the fence. 19 off the over. SL: 128/1 in 17 overs

Nelson!! 111-1 after a risky two. It lasts just one ball before Thirimanne gets a single down to third man.

Yikes! Afghanistan has already conceded 15 wides in this match; the most recorded during an innings so far in this World Cup. The previous high also came from Afghanistan against Australia with 14.

Sri Lanka do not have a great record at Sophia Gardens. Can it improve on its poor run today? Read more to find out.

Rashid Khan is into the attack now.

4:06 pm: 100 up for Sri Lanka. The boundary drought is over for Sri Lanka after Thirimanne slaps a Naib free-hit straight past the bowler. SL: 104/1 in 15 overs

3:59 pm: The pressure pays off in the form of a wicket! 33 dot balls and Karunaratne goes for a lofted shot and doesn't get to the pitch of the Nabi delivery, and holes out to long-on fielder. He departs for a well made 30. Lahiru Thirimanne is the new man in at no. 3. SL: 95/1 in 14 overs

3:52 pm: Afghanistan is pulling things back a bit with spin and Naib's medium pace. 27 balls since Sri Lanka's last boundary. SL: 86/0 in 12 overs

3:43 pm: Nabi and Mujeeb arrest Sri Lanka's momentum in the last two overs conceding just eight. Sri Lanka will be happy with the start after its shoddy show the bat against New Zealand in the first game. SL: 79/0 in 10 overs

3:37 pm: Nabi brings some respite with just three runs but looks like Perera is keen to make up for it. He steps down the track to Mujeeb and carves him to the leg side boundary before cutting him square to the point boundary. SL: 71/0 in 8 overs

Off-spinner Mohammed Nabi is into the attack now.

3:29 pm: A good over is ruined by a full delivery on the leg stump which Karunaratne puts it away with ease to the mid-wicket fence. SL: 59/0 in 6 overs

The Sri Lankan openers have negated the overcast conditions mostly due to the poor bowling from the Afghan new ball bowlers. Naib now turns to spin in the form of Mujeeb ur Rehman.

3:26 pm: There is a bit of drizzle in Cardiff at the moment but that hasn't stopped the boundaries for Sri Lanka. Perera slaps Zadran over mid-wicket and the bowler sticks one into the pitch and the ball flies over the head of the batsman and the 'keeper Shahzad for another five wides. Fifty up for Sri Lanka inside five overs with Karunaratne tucking a delivery to the fine leg boundary. SL: 52/0 in 5 overs

3:20 pm: Hassan is under the pump here! He bowls five wides before Perera slashes him over covers for a boundary. Ian Smith on the air says 'There is a hint of Sanath Jayasuriya in that shot from Perera' and we couldn't help but agree with his dominant bottom hand stroke-making. Karunaratne ends the over with another boundary to the mid-wicket boundary. 15 of his first over, 16 of his second. 37/0 in 4 overs

3:15 pm: Zadran helps pull the run-rate back a bit by holding one end on Karunaratne. SL: 21/0 in 3 overs

Hassan with a wayward start today considering he bowled two maiden overs to David Warner in the last game.

3:11pm: Perera comes out blazing against Hamid Hassan, pulling him for a boundary and slashing one between point and cover to run three runs. Hamid, then, goes around the wicket and pitches one up. Perera welcomes that with a smashing drive down to the mid-off boundary. Karunaratne prods on towards third man for another two to end the over. 15 runs off the over. SL: 19/0 in 2 overs

3:07 pm: Zadran struck Karunaratne with an in-swinger with the first ball but the southpaw gets behind the line and gets bat on ball for the rest of the over. Zadran errs with his line of the fifth delivery and Karunaratne tucks it away fine for a boundary to get Sri Lanka underway. SL: 4/0 in 1 overs

Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera open for Sri Lanka. Dawlat Zadran with the new ball.

===============================

We are through with the national anthems of the respective countries. It's game time in Cardiff. Both sides searching for their first win. Who will open their account?

=============================

TOSS UPDATE: Afghanistan has won the toss and elected to bowl.

Gulbadin Naib: ""We want to bowl first. The conditions are good for the bowlers. It's a good toss to win. We struggled in the middle, we put a good total, but that wasn't good enough against a good team like Australia. Sri Lanka is a champion side. No changes.""

Dimuth Karunaratne: ""In the last game also we batted first. The batsmen have an idea how to bat here. It's (captaincy) not easy, it's a good challenge. They give me support. Jeevan Mendis is not playing. Pradeep is playing.""

Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne, Dimuth Karunaratne(c), Kusal Perera(w), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Isuru Udana, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga

Afghanistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Hazratullah Zazai, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib(c), Najibullah Zadran, Rashid Khan, Dawlat Zadran, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Hamid Hassan

One change for Sri Lanka: Jeevan Mendis out Nuwan Pradeep is in

Overcast conditions in Cardiff with chances of rain later in the day. In other words, win toss, bowl first kind of day.

===================

Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib has stressed on the need to bat sensibly against Sri Lanka and believes the team has the potential to score 300.

Cardiff, one of the flattest cities in Great Britain, is a city of parks. It has more green space per person than any other core UK city| Know your venue

In four World Cups in England, Sri Lanka has never reached the second round and has won only four of its 17 games| Aiming to rise above chaos

This is the second World Cup appearance for Afghanistan — it had featured in the 2015 edition — and on paper, the side looks pretty balanced with a perfect blend of youth and experience| Ready to rock the boat

Afghanistan and Sri Lanka will both be hoping to bounce back after heavy opening defeats when they meet in the Cricket World Cup on Tuesday.

Here's today's Match Preview:

The two nations were soundly beaten in their opening fixtures at this year’s tournament, both failing to bat out 50 overs before watching their opponents knock off below-par scores with ease.

Sri Lanka's innings lasted just 29.2 overs against New Zealand in Cardiff on Saturday as it posted a paltry 136 in testing conditions with only three batsmen making it to double figures.

World Cup 2019: Full coverage

The Kiwis knocked off the runs without losing a wicket, meaning Sri Lanka is yet to register a win in the Welsh capital in five games.

It is back at the same venue to take on an Afghanistan side who managed to do slightly better with the bat at nearby Bristol at the weekend, though a total of 207 all out was never enough to trouble reigning champions Australia.

The only previous World Cup meeting between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka came four years ago, with the latter victorious by four wickets in Dunedin.

However, Dimuth Karunaratne's side have lost nine of its last 10 ODI games in 2019, also suffered a 91-run defeat in its most recent meeting with its next opponents, at the Asia Cup last September.

Read: It's all about the speed!

Thisara Perera claimed five wickets in a losing cause on that occasion but the all-rounder will be looked to contribute with the bat in England, too.

His strike rate of 112.4 runs per 100 deliveries is impressive; of the 225 players to score over 2,000 ODI runs only three - Glenn Maxwell, Jos Buttler and Shahid Afridi - have done so at a faster rate.

Perera made 27 at the weekend while Sri Lanka struggled against the Black Caps' battery of seamers, Afghanistan will rely more heavily on its spinners to do the damage.

Rashid Khan is the key bowler for Afghanistan, having claimed 99 one-day wickets since the start of 2017, more than any other slow bowler.

Interestingly, none of the six sides who have opted to bat first in an ODI at Cardiff after winning the toss have prevailed. Considering the early start in English conditions, the captains may want to factor in the ground's history when deciding what to do at the toss.

Teams: Afghanistan (From): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Hazratullah Zazai, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib (c), Najibullah Zadran, Rashid Khan, Dawlat Zadran, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Hamid Hassan, Aftab Alam, Samiullah Shinwari, Asghar Afghan, Noor Ali Zadran Sri Lanka (From): Lahiru Thirimanne, Dimuth Karunaratne(c), Kusal Perera(w), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Isuru Udana, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga, Avishka Fernando, Jeffrey Vandersay, Nuwan Pradeep, Milinda Siriwardana

36,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Does lack of black models on cover of British Vogue amount to racism? - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/black-model-british-vogue-naomi-campbell-racism,"Landing the front cover of British Vogue catapults a model to supermodel status, it is an integral part of being booked for the biggest catwalks and advertising campaigns. It is a gateway to stardom, a pinnacle of fashion modelling. It has also become resolutely white-only.

The August 2002 edition of British Vogue featured Naomi Campbell as the cover star – smiling and relaxed in boot cut jeans and a white vest. Since then, 12 years and 146 covers have been shot, edited and distributed to newsstands and not one has featured an individual black model.

In September 2013 Naomi Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison wrote an open letter calling on designers to diversify their catwalks. ""No matter the intention, the result is racism. Not accepting another based on the colour of their skin is clearly beyond aesthetic.""

As well as designers, there is increasing anger at the attitudes of major fashion magazines such as British Vogue.

Modelling agencies are keen for the industry to move forward and are openly vying for the top spot. Carole White, founder of Premier Model Management and outspoken critic of the lack of diversity in the fashion industry, says: ""I'm surprised that there has not been a black model on the cover of British Vogue for this amount of time as we are such a diverse country, but perhaps British Vogue think the calibre of black models are not out there?""

""Back when Premier Model Management looked after Naomi Campbell, she was the first and only black model to front the Prada campaign in 1994 then went onto do the British Vogue cover in 2002. Our Premier Model Malaika is the first girl since Naomi to front a Prada campaign (the 2014 campaign), so logic would dictate that Malaika would be the next black model to appear on the cover soon.""

Jody Furlong, founder of The Eye Casting, believes the decision to exclude black models from the cover is deliberate. ""Let's talk about British models for a start, because that would be one excuse – 'oh there's no British girls'. There is Naomi Campbell, probably the biggest British model of all time other than Kate Moss; Malaika Firth a really massive model at the moment; Betty Adewole a Tom Ford model; and of course Jourdan Dunn – one of the biggest models in the world.""

I asked British Vogue whether they had an explanation for their editorial policy and how they responded to allegations that their actions amount to racism. In particular could they explain why industry favourite Dunn has not been given her own cover (she was in a group cover six years ago). As Furlong points out: ""Jourdan Dunn is a Burberry girl, a Givenchy girl, a Prada girl. There is no debate about whether she is beautiful enough or elegant enough or the right kind of person to be on Vogue – she ticks every single box.""

The reply from the Vogue press office, accredited to editor Alexandra Shulman states: ""We have put Beyoncé and Rihanna on the cover of Vogue and at least half our covers do not feature models. We love Jourdan Dunn and she was the cover star of the last Miss Vogue which previously had featured Cara Delevingne.""

Anna Wintour's US edition of Vogue is almost entirely dominated by celebrity covers, with white actresses making up the overwhelming majority. When a celebrity appears on the cover of a magazine she is not there purely as a symbol of beauty but because of other accolades.

Is it truly the case then that black models are just kept off British Vogue by celebrities? The online archive of all British Vogue covers since 1916 shows that since Naomi Campbell in August 2002, 95 covers have featured models compared to just 58 featuring celebrities (Beyonce and Rihanna being just two). So far in 2014 there have been two celebrities used, compared to seven white models.

The chosen models do multiple covers – Kate Moss had three covers in 2006 alone, Cara Delevingne is on her second this year. But there are also numerous appearances by models who are unknown beyond the confines of fashion, like Daria Werbowy and Natalia Vodianova.

As well as 'there aren't any black models' or 'it's because of celebrity culture', there is another excuse for racism floating around the fashion industry: ""There is this fallacy that 'black covers don't sell'"" explains Furlong. ""But how do you know? There hasn't been one for twelve years! You can't say people don't buy it when they're not given the chance to buy it.""

As well as being deeply offensive to black women, being used as an excuse for racism is insulting to consumers of fashion magazines. The last 12 years of side-lining black models reflects the attitudes of those at the top of the fashion industry, not those of fashion fans. The fashion industry has a problem with race which goes far beyond just fashion magazine covers, however ending years of cover discrimination would be an important step. Based in London, one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world, British Vogue could be spearheading change.

""Treat black models the same as you would treat any other kind of model,"" states Furlong. ""Jourdan Dunn is a household name, there has to have been a specific and conscious decision not to use her. If she was white, at her level, she would have had multiple Vogue covers by now – no doubt about it.""

1645,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"Australia's Suncorp receives 7600 claims from flooding crisis, expects more - Nasdaq",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/australias-suncorp-receives-7600-claims-from-flooding-crisis-expects-more-2021-03-30,"March 31 (Reuters) - Insurer Suncorp Group Ltd SUN.AX said on Wednesday it had received 7,600 claims for damages from severe flooding along Australia's east coast, a number it expects will increase in coming days.

Authorities began recovery efforts as water levels receded this week after incessant rains triggered the worst floods in Australia's most populous state of New South Wales (NSW) in more than half a century.

Suncorp estimated net claims from the event to be between A$230 million ($174.73 million) and A$250 million and said costs were expected to rise further. Costs would be capped at A$250 million under its main catastrophe program, it said.

The company said about three quarters of claims were from NSW, while around 20% of the claims were from Queensland, with the severity of claims varying significantly between regions.

Insurance Australia Group Ltd IAG.AX said on Friday it had received 8,000 claims for flood damages worth about A$135 million ($102.32 million) and was expecting more claims to be filed.

776,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: President Launches Community Mining Programme - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907260690.html,"press release

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has launched a Community Mining Programme (CMP) at Wassa Akropong, in the Western Region.

The Community Mining Programme is aimed at formalizing mining in selected communities across the country.

With at least one community mine expected to be set up in each of the mining districts in the country, the community mines are expected to provide job openings for over 4,500 miners that were trained by the government at the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Tarkwa.

At the ceremony to launch the pilot programme on Wednesday, President Akufo-Addo said the Community Mining Programme would ensure that ""mining will be done the right way, within the tenets of the law, and will not destroy our natural resources.""

He said, ""Today, we are launching a type of mining that will benefit all of us. I am here to plead with the young men who are participating in the community mining to do their best to adhere to all the laws and do a good job so that money will return to Wassa Amenfi. The money will come.""

He assured that the programme would be replicated in other towns in Ghana by September this year, and would be closely monitored to ensure that the standards that have been set for the CMP are adhered to.

The Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Prof. Kwabena Frimpong Boateng said the Minerals Commission had acquired several zones in each of the mining districts for this purpose, with some traditional authorities also providing land for the CMP.

He said some large-scale mining companies have shed off areas to be used for the CMP, and, between now and September, concessions for the various CMP would be mapped out by the IMCIM Mapping Team and uploaded onto the GalamStop software.

Prof. Frimpong Boateng stressed that canoes fitted with outboard motors have been procured for the Riverine Team to monitor the water bodies.

""With the rolling out of the CMP, there should be no excuse whatsoever for miners to be mining illegally in the water bodies,"" he added.",2019-07-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['wassa', 'cmp', 'mining', 'president', 'community', 'water', 'money', 'mines', 'launches', 'team', 'programme', 'ghana', 'set']",Ghana,news article,English

The News/Files

ISLAMABAD: A red alert was issued Tuesday by the federal capital's administration over possible flooding caused by rains expected to lash the city this week.



The Islamabad administration said Ghauri Town, Soan Gardens, and Sectors I-8 and I-9 were forecast to be inundated with rainwater following the heavy rains.

It further underlined that the Soan and Korang rivers, as well as the Simly and Rawal dams, near Islamabad and Rawalpindi were expected to flood during the ongoing week

Flooding was also feared to occur in the kutchi abaadis (slums) in Sectors F-9, G-6, G-8, H-9, and I-9, as well as Khanna Pul, Ghauri Town, and Soan, the administration said.

It warned that opening the Simly and Rawal dams' spillways would likely inundate the Soan and Korang rivers and disrupt electricity, water, and sewerage services in the areas.

The Islamabad administration has imposed an emergency in the federal capital's hospitals ahead of possible destruction due to the rains forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and noted that local schools would be used as relief camps in case of flooding.",2020-09-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['rivers', 'flash', 'schools', 'simly', 'possible', 'issues', 'soan', 'flooding', 'sectors', 'islamabad', 'administration', 'alert', 'used', 'town', 'red']",Pakistan,news article,English

The Black Stars' position on the global table has not been helped by their Round of 16 elimination at the continental showpiece

Ghana are unmoved in the latest edition of the Fifa World Rankings, released for the month of July on Thursday.

The Black Stars still hold 50th position on the table. However, their total accumulated points have increased from 1423 to 1429.

Placed 55th in July last year, Ghana now find themselves between Norway (50) and Jamaica (52).

The Black Stars' status on the table is largely down to their performance at the recent Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt where they exited the tournament in the Round of 16.

They won just one of four games played, a 2-0 triumph against Guinea-Bissau in the last group game, and drew three other matches.

James Appiah's outfit opened their tournament with a 2-2 draw with Benin, settled for a 0-0 deadlock with Cameroon and played out a 1-1 draw with Tunisia after extra-time in the Round of 16. The last game was ultimately decided by a penalty shootout which the Black Stars lost 5-4.

It was only the first time since 2006 Ghana failed to make the quarter-finals.

On the continental ranking, Ghana have fallen by one place to seventh, only ahead of Cameroon (53), Congo DR (56) and Cote d'Ivoire (57) in the top 10.

Senegal (20), Tunisia (29), Nigeria (33), African champions Algeria (40), Morocco (41) and Egypt (49) are the top six nations.

Significantly, Afcon bronze medalists Nigeria and Algeria have moved up by 12 and 28 places respectively on the world rankings, which is still led by Belgium.

Brazil have moved up by one place to second, with France, England, Uruguay, Portugal, Croatia, Colombia, Spain and Argentina following in that order to complete the top 10.

Southern Africa is warming at about twice the global rate and has been buffeted by multiple and compounding shocks.

Some 12 million people in nine countries across the region are experiencing severe food insecurity.

Consecutive shocks have exhausted families’ resilience and decimated their livelihoods.

Families are adopting extreme coping mechanisms, including child labour, child trafficking, early marriage and transactional sex.

KEY MESSAGES

Communities across Southern Africa are on the frontier of the global climate crisis. The region is warming at about twice the global rate and has been buffeted by multiple and compounding shocks. Millions of families are still recovering from the devastating consequences of Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, which impacted the Comoros, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe earlier this year. At the same time, many areas are now in the grip of a destructive drought, including in Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Mozambique and Zambia. Namibia and Mozambique have both extended their national drought emergencies to March 2020, while Lesotho declared a new drought emergency in October.

Humanitarian needs are rapidly rising as the lean season deepens and some 12 million people in nine countries* across the region are experiencing severe food insecurity. At least 12 districts are projected to face ‘Emergency’ food insecurity (IPC phase 4) between October and March, including 3 in Zambia (Gwembe, Lunga and Shangómbo) and 9 in Zimbabwe (Binga, Buhera, Chivi, Gokwe North, Kariba, Mbire, Mudzi, Mwenezi and UMP). More than 60 per cent (14 out of 23) of communes assessed in three provinces (Cuando Cubango, Huila and Cunene) of southern Angola are in IPC phase 4.

Consecutive shocks have exhausted families’ resilience and decimated their livelihoods. In multiple locations, the 2018/2019 season saw total crop failure. Farmers who lost their crops have been forced to rely on markets to access food, while prices keep increasing, especially for maize—the main staple food in the region. Livestock deaths are rising due to limited pasture and water, coupled with recurrent disease outbreaks. In southern Angola alone, more than 27,700 animals have died. The continued presence of fall armyworm and cassava brown streak disease—a new disease reported for the first time in northern Zambia—also pose ongoing risks to crops, while seasonal jobs are few and far between, as better-off households who would ordinarily provide them have themselves been impacted by drought, floods and economic hardship. Even in the best-case scenario of good rainfall, it could take at least two to three growing seasons for small-scale farms to return to normal production.

Acute malnutrition—rarely seen in Southern Africa—is increasing and heightens the risk of death for the more than one in four children across the region who are already stunted. More than 1,000 cases of pellagra—Vitamin B3 deficiency—have been reported in the areas of Mozambique hardest-hit by Cyclone Idai. The southern dry areas of Angola, which have been hit by consecutive droughts, have reported increasing admissions of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. In Zimbabwe, eight districts now have global acute malnutrition rates above 5 per cent, signifying a deteriorating situation. In Madagascar, acute malnutrition is expected to remain high, despite improved food insecurity. Across the region, more than 29 per cent of children suffer from stunting. Children who are both stunted (chronically malnourished) and wasted (acutely malnourished) have the highest risk of death.

There are reports across the region of families adopting extreme coping mechanisms, including child labour, child trafficking, early marriage and transactional sex, with dire consequences for women and girls’ sexual and reproductive health. Rising food and nutrition insecurity are increasing the risk of displacement, school drop-outs and gender-based violence, with school-aged girls facing the biggest risk of dropping out or missing class as they search for water, food and firewood for their families. In the face of severe water shortages, women and girls are also struggling to maintain menstrual hygiene, undermining their health and dignity.

Millions of families lack access to clean drinking water, basic healthcare and adequate sanitation, compounding the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. In 2019, climatic shocks and other underlying challenges have caused outbreaks of cholera (Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia), hepatitis E (Namibia), dengue fever (Mauritius and Tanzania), measles (Angola,

Comoros, Lesotho and Madagascar) and vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (Angola and Zambia). At the same time, strikes by healthcare professionals in Eswatini and Zimbabwe have compromised access to care for millions of people.

The region is at serious risk of backsliding in its fight against HIV/AIDS as a result of these shocks. In several countries, women engaging in transactional sex to help their families survive have reported that men would pay more for sex without a condom.

Food insecurity also undermines HIV treatment adherence, retention and success. Adolescent girls face the greatest risk of newly contracting HIV and for every three new HIV infections among young men (aged 15–24 years) in southern Africa, there are seven new infections among young women.

There is a strong likelihood of back-to-back droughts in multiple areas across the region, highlighting the critical importance of early action. The Indian Ocean Dipole, which is currently in its strongest ‘positive’ state since 2006 is associated with below-normal rain across Southern Africa and many countries have already experienced a late-onset to the 2019/2020 rainy season. At the same time, there is also the likelihood of strong cyclones hitting some countries, especially in the east part of Southern Africa, foreboding a potential second consecutive poor harvest.

New funding is urgently required to enable humanitarians to respond to the most life-threatening needs across the region.

Humanitarian partners are deploying staff and mobilizing supplies for the countries and areas facing the most acute life-saving needs this lean season. However, despite the generosity of key donors, humanitarian appeals in the region remain seriously underfunded.

In Zimbabwe, just 50 per cent of the required amount has been mobilized (US$236 million out of $468 million), while in Mozambique, less than 50 per cent of the appeal has been funded ($291 million out of $620 million).",2019-12-06 08:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'mozambique', 'key', 'southern', 'humanitarian', 'angola', 'messages', '2019', 'food', 'countries', 'zimbabwe', 'million', 'risk', 'families', 'region']",Mozambique,news article,English

1455,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"Egypt battles COVID-19 amid flood of misinformation, conspiracy theories - Al-Monitor",https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2020/03/egyptian-superstitions-jokes-on-coronavirus.html,"When initial reports of the new coronavirus surfaced in Egypt in February, Egyptians responded with denial. The Egyptian media, many internet users and a handful of celebrities dismissed COVID-19 as a hoax and even joked about it.

Asked about the threat from COVID-19, Egyptian film stars attending the opening ceremony of the Luxor African Film Festival mocked the pandemic.

""We eat salted fish and onions, are you joking? What coronavirus are you talking about? The coronavirus will fall ill if it comes to Egypt,"" joked actress Zena.

""We are Egyptians, nothing scares us,"" comedian Badria Tolba told reporters. ""We are being asked to avoid large gatherings, but we continue to gather; they advise us not to kiss, but we kiss each other all the time.""

""I actually like Corona with milk and Turkish delight,"" she added, referencing the Egyptian chocolate brand that shares the virus' name. A video clip of her remarks spread quickly, sparking controversy on social media.

In the early weeks, after news of the pandemic broke, the media promoted the narrative that Egypt is ""untouchable"" and that Egyptians ""are immune"" to coronavirus.

Talk show hosts across Egyptian TV promoted the message that ""Egypt is protected by God. No harm can befall us."" Clerics propagated a similar message on social media. In one video, a preacher tells worshippers in his Friday sermon: ""Muslims shouldn't fear coronavirus. They perform ablution five times a day, which makes it impossible for them to get infected."" In another online video, a Coptic Orthodox priest in Assiut asks his congregation to repeat after him, ""If we pray from the bottom of our hearts, coronavirus won't come anywhere near us.""

Veteran TV presenter Sanaa Mansour said on her show on the DMC satellite channel, ""We drink our water and don't get sick so it seems we [Egyptians] have developed a natural immunity to viruses that kill people elsewhere."" Her comment was a reference to the poor quality of Egypt's drinking water, generally considered unsafe.

Said Sadek, a political sociologist at Nile University, attributed such misconceptions to Egyptians' perception of themselves as resistant to external factors. ""We have a saying, 'Egyptians eat pebbles,' which basically means we can overcome practically anything,"" Sadek told Al-Monitor. “This is the result of a media narrative that persistently inflates our self-image. It also stems from the fact that many poor Egyptians struggle on a daily basis and yet miraculously manage to survive. They are inclined to underestimate the threat of the virus because the way they see it is: How does a virus that causes flu-like symptoms compare to the hardships we face every day?""

After the suspension of international flights to and from Egypt in mid-March, initial skepticism gave way to anxiety and fear, which, in turn, prompted even more misinformation about COVID-19. Fake news flooded Egyptian TV, including a host of alleged COVID-19 cures and prevention methods. TV anchor Amany El Khayat suggested on her show on Extra News that ""drinking tea is a sure way of killing the virus in the throat before it reaches one's chest.""

In a live TV interview on al-Nahar satellite channel, former TV presenter Moufid Fawzy claimed that India was the only other country besides Egypt that was coronavirus-free ""because spices that are high in chromium are widely consumed in the Indian diet."" While chromium has indeed been found to help metabolize fats and control blood sugar, spices are by no means the only source of this essential mineral, also found in whole grains, cereals, mushrooms and a variety of other foods. More importantly, no medical evidence supports Fawzy's claim that chromium helps prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Egyptian social media is also rife with fake coronavirus cures. In an audio file making the rounds on Facebook and Twitter, a woman shares what she claims to be ""a magical cure for the new virus: gargling with warm salty water three times a day.""

“I tried it myself after coming down with what I'm pretty sure was coronavirus disease. It cured my cough instantly and relieved the pain in my throat,"" she says.

Scores of Egyptians defied the government's calls to stay home and flocked to the beaches in Alexandria the weekend of March 27. The move prompted Alexandria Gov. Mohamed El Sherif to order the closure of all Alexandria beaches, effective March 29.

Some traders, meanwhile, are exploiting fear of the pandemic by promoting their products online as cures to prevent or treat the coronavirus. One herbalist reportedly put up a sign in his store reading ""anti-coronavirus anise seeds sold here,"" according to the news portal El Balad. He also published a picture of the product on social media, evoking interest among some internet users who asked where they could buy the anise seeds, El Balad reported.

The spice, used to enhance flavor in food or consumed as an herbal tea, is known for its therapeutic benefits, including the improvement of digestion.

Another online rumor advocates consuming onions and garlic to protect against coronavirus. In a sarcastic tweet, comedian Mohamed Henedy argued that this would be a good way to help people self-isolate.

Conspiracy theories also abound. A popular theory among Egyptian internet users claims that Chinese bat soup is the origin of the virus. The belief gained ground after false claims circulated online that the Egyptian Ministry of Health was checking Chinese restaurants for the new coronavirus. It led to an apparent spike in xenophobia against the Chinese in Egypt. A shocking online video shows a Chinese man running back and forth on a busy Cairo street, trying to get a lift. Drivers ignore his signal for them to stop and a car nearly runs him over. This is after the driver he had been riding with abandons him — and the car — for fear of becoming infected. The driver is earlier advised by another driver to dump his Chinese passenger on the road. The Chinese man who seems bewildered by the disappearance of the driver is also mocked by Egyptians shouting ""corona, corona!""

Egypt's pro-government media, meanwhile, are pushing the idea that coronavirus is a lab-manufactured biological weapon to destroy the Chinese economy. Advocates of this conspiracy theory made no mention of where the virus may have originated. TV presenter Basma Wahba devoted an episode of her daily show on the ONE channel to biological warfare in early February. ""Machine guns and cannons are no longer the weapons used in today's wars. Some countries resort to bio-weapons to target the economies of other states,"" she said.

Other talk show hosts like Ahmed Moussa attempted to politically exploit the pandemic. He accused the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood of spreading coronavirus. ""Malaysia is among the countries hardest hit by the new virus because it has given refuge to exiled members of the group,"" Moussa said on his show on Sada al-Balad TV channel. ""Wherever the Muslim Brotherhood goes, crises emerge!""

But perhaps the weirdest — and most chilling — phenomenon to arise from the pandemic is the spread of apocalyptic prophecies. An online video published March 23, shows a man standing in front of a mosque and claiming to be ""the awaited Mahdi,"" or savior. According to the sayings of Prophet Muhammad, or hadiths, the Mahdi is a descendant of the prophet who will appear before Judgement Day to rid the world of injustice, oppression and other evils. ""I am the Mahdi sent by Prophet Muhammad to spread his message across the world, there is no prophet after me, for I am here to redeem you,"" the man shouts.

Sadek is not surprised. ""In uncertain times, it is not uncommon to find some power-hungry people who make tantalizing promises to change the world,"" he said. ""Very often, those are cult leaders or attention seekers from poor backgrounds. They appear in marginalized areas where the residents are also poor and uneducated and so are more likely to be influenced.""",2020-03-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'amid', 'egypt', 'conspiracy', 'tv', 'media', 'virus', 'theories', 'misinformation', 'egyptian', 'egyptians', 'battles', 'chinese', 'coronavirus', 'online', 'video', 'covid19']",Egypt,news article,English
1784,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Nigeria: Dozens Killed, Houses Destroyed As Floods Ravage North-Central Nigeria - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202009250681.html,"Torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks wreaked havoc in the North-central sub-region of Nigeria.

State governments in the North-central region of Nigeria are employing measures to halt the perennial flooding ravaging parts of the zone and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that torrential rains accompanied by strong winds have in recent weeks claimed many lives, destroyed hundreds of houses and washed away farmlands and domestic animals in the sub-region.

The catastrophe compelled the governments in the zone to take steps to avert further flooding and provide succour to the affected people such as temporary shelters, food and medicines.

In Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule ordered the immediate evacuation of persons whose houses had been submerged by flood in Nasarawa, headquarters of Nasarawa Local Government Area.

Mr Sule also directed that foodstuff, mattresses and other relief items be provided to the victims immediately.

His spokesperson, Ibrahim Addra, said the governor had visited the ancient town and sympathised with the people over the incident.

He urged the people to desist from erecting structures on waterways and stop indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the drains.

In response to the governor's directive, the Nasarawa State Emergency Management Agency (NASEMA) distributed food and non-food relief materials to over 45 communities ravaged by flood in Awe and Nasarawa local government areas of the state.

The Executive Secretary of the agency, Zakari Allumagas, said the governor gave the order during his visit to Nasarawa following the flood in the town.

Mr Allumagas said the relief materials comprised 44 trucks of 600 bags each of assorted grains and three trucks of non-food items such as building materials, children's clothing, cooking utensils and mats.

He warned against diversion of the items.

He also disclosed that over 700 households were displaced by floods in such communities as Ara, Udenyi Magaji, Ugya and Gude, Nasarawa town in Nasarawa Local Government Area, and Ribi and Gidan Soja in Awe Local Government Area.

The executive secretary said the state government was working with traditional and community leaders to come up with a directive banning approval and sale of lands near riverine areas of the state.

In Kogi, the State Commissioner for Environment, Victor Omofaiye, said many communities in some local government areas in the state had been ravaged by floods.

Mr Omofaiye said such communities included places in Kotonkarfe, Lokoja, Ajaokuta and Ibaji local government areas.

He said some victims of the disaster had already been moved to IDPs camps in Kotonkarfe, while the IDPs camps and flood estates in Lokoja were being prepared through clearing of their surroundings and fumigation for resettlement of the flood victims.

He said that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) had predicted that in 2020, about 10 local government areas would be affected by flood in Kogi.

They are Lokoja, Kogi/Kotonkarfe, Ajaokuta, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela, Ofu, Adavi and Omala.

""The water level of River Niger is still fluctuating within the range of 10.5 to 10.7, but as at September 21, it was 10.7 compared to the 12.5 as at the same period in 2012 in Kogi.

""Flood is a menace that we experience in Kogi every year. The flood we experienced in Kogi in 2012 was massive and devastating; we do not pray for such in 2020, but we are actually on red alert,"" the commissioner said.

He attributed flooding in the state to human and natural factors.

According to him, the human factor has to do with the people's habit in managing the environment as they dump refuse on waterways and drains, thereby obstructing free flow of water.

Mr Omofaiye said that the confluence of two major rivers in Kogi: River Niger and Benue, which most times overflowed their banks, was affecting communities along the river paths, including those of other small rivers that took their sources from river Niger and Benue.

""Opening of dams, especially along River Niger, such as Lagdo Dam from Cameroon and other dams also cause flooding in Kogi due to high volume of water.

""We have done a lot of sensitisation and awareness creation to educate the general public, especially the people living in the flood prone areas in all the predicted local government areas.

""We are also partnering with the relevant stakeholders including SEMA to ensure that we are ahead of any emerging situation,"" he said.

He said he had led a team on assessment tour of some affected communities in Lokoja to ascertain the level of damage done by flood in the area and begin to tackle them head on.

The commissioner said the Governor Yahaya Bello administration would not relent in its efforts at tackling environmental challenges including flooding across the state.

He, therefore, advised the people living in the flood prone areas to relocate and move to high grounds in order not to endanger their lives as a result of floods.

The situation is similar in Plateau as the acting Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Rose Dakwar, said that floods had affected seven local government areas in the state recently.

Mrs Dakwar listed the affected local government areas as Mangu, Pankshin, Shendam, Quan Pan, Langtang South, Mikang and Wase.

She said that many farmlands, houses bridges and other valuables were destroyed by the floods in the listed areas.

""We as an emergency management agency, have already visited each of the affected local government areas in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

""We visited and ascertained the level of damage and reported back to government.

""Government has, therefore, included the affected areas in the distribution of palliatives before the major assistance will come their way,"" she said.

Also, the NEMA Zonal Coordinator in Jos, Eugene Nyenlong, said the agency had composed jingles in local languages to educate the people on how to tackle floods if they occurred.

Mr Nyenlong also disclosed that the agency in the zone was making use of Flood Vanguards comprising youth corps members who raised alarms if flood occurred.

""We also have locals that are engaged to act in terms of response and evacuation when flood occurs,"" he said.

In Niger, not less than 500 communities have been flooded since the onset of the 2020 raining season in the state.

The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ahmed Inga, who disclosed this also said about 22 local government areas had so far been affected by the floods.

Mr Inga said 29 deaths were recorded during the floods, while 45,000 farmers were directly affected by the disaster.

""Farmlands and houses have been destroyed and assessment is still ongoing, "" he said.

He said Governor Abubakar Bello had directed the agency to look inward and design a better way of mitigating the situation by relocating the affected communities to safe areas.

The Governor of Niger-State, Abubakar Sani Bello [PHOTO CREDIT: Official Twitter handle of Mr Bello || @abusbello]He said that the state government had identified 13 resettlement sites in Muregi, Akere and Ketso, among others, where the affected communities were being resettled.

He said that compensations had been paid and allocation of plots to the affected communities would soon commence.

The director-general blamed the flooding partly on the situation where the state was home to three hydro-electric dams- Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba, and River Niger and River Kaduna flowing across parts of the state.

Similarly, the Benue Government has assured residents of flood prone areas of its plans to tackle the incessant flooding in communities in the state.

The State Director of Environment, Richarge Azaagee, who disclosed this, said plans were underway to address some of the flooding challenges, especially in Makurdi.

Mr Azaagee denied that the government had abandoned communities suffering from flood related challenges.

He said the government had already identified the causes of flooding in some communities/settlements and was working toward fixing them.

""The problem of erosion and flood is not just in Kaamem community alone, it cuts across many communities in Makurdi and the state at large.

NAN reports that places badly hit by flood in Makurdi are Agber village, Behind ITF Makurdi, Wurukum market, part of Judges Quarters, Low Level, Down Katsina-Ala Street, Kaamem community, Achussah village, and Nyiman village amongst others.

More than 1,000 families displaced by floods that ravaged Karusandara Sub County, Kasese district close to three months ago, are struggling to survive.



The families were displaced after the floods hit villages of Kivengenyi, Kabaka, Kanamba and Kyalanga in Karusandara Sub County following a heavy downpour that burst the banks of River Mubuku and Nyamwamba.



With no access to necessities, the families can hardly afford a meal a day. They accuse both government and the local leadership for deliberately refusing to address their plight.



The victims who include pregnant women, youth, children and the elderly are camped in nine IDPs spread across the sub-county.



Erias Forda, a resident of Kivengenyi village says that he lacks food to feed his family after all his garden was washed away by the floods. Forda who has camped Karusandara seed secondary school with his eight children says that they last received relief food in June.



“All our plantations were washed away, even the remaining is drying up, so we have not food or a place to return to,” Forda says

The Somali National Movement which took over the northern regions facilitated a broad-based conference in Burco attended by traditional leaders of all six regions of Somaliland who unanimously agreed to the dissolution of the union with Somalia and proclaimed independence on 18 May 1991.

The conference also established Somaliland’s first government, based on the SNM’s organisational structure, with its Chairman, Abdirahman Ahmed Ali, becoming Somaliland’s first executive president and the SNM Central Committee functioning as the country’s first parliament. It had a two-year mandate, and was tasked with accommodating non-Isaaq clans into the government, developing a constitution and preparing Somaliland for elections.

The new country continued to suffer violence and weak institutions, with elders stepping in to prevent degeneration into protracted civil war. In 1992, the first of two major clan conferences, held in Sheekh, created the national Guurti, or council of elders, bringing together elders from all the clans responsible for controlling clan militia and preventing conflict, as well as defending the country.

The 1993 Borama Conference

The second major clan conference assembled in Borama, a city in the West of Somaliland, for nearly five months in 1993. It eventually produced a National Charter which established government structures and the separation of powers for a transitional two-year period, pending the adoption of a new constitution. The charter included the creation of a bicameral parliament, with the Guurti formally institutionalised as the upper house, and the lower house made up of elected representatives. A clan-based electoral college elected Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal president for two years as well as members of the guurti and the lower house.

The political system established in 1993 became known as Shirbeelad, meaning “clan” or “community,” integrating indigenous forms of institutional arrangements with modern institutions of government. It was only meant to be in place for three years but lasted a decade.

Following the transition of power from the SNM leader Abdirahman to Egal, the new administration now had two years to prepare an interim constitution for approval by parliament and the upper house. The process proved to be time-consuming, necessitating extensions of the charter’s deadline.

Ultimately, two drafts were produced. In 1994, the government hired a Sudanese lawyer to write the constitution while the House of Representatives appointed an ad-hoc committee advised by lawyers, traditional leaders, religious figures and politicians which, suspecting the government’s draft would give excessive power to the executive branch, drafted an alternate version. Following deliberations to reconcile the two documents, a unified draft was adopted as the interim constitution in 1996, with a three-year implementation period leading up to a referendum. A final, revised constitution was approved by both houses on 30 April 2000 and overwhelmingly endorsed by 97 per cent of voters in a public referendum held on 31 May 2001.

The local government and parliamentary electoral system

The constitutional referendum paved the way for popular elections. The first set of municipal and national elections held between 2002 and 2005 were conducted by a novice electoral commission with almost no international technical and financial support and without many of the accoutrements of modern elections such as censuses, comprehensive voter registers and voter education. Though not without problems, disagreements and accusations of malpractice, the elections were considered largely credible, free and fair, and their outcomes were widely accepted.

The constitution defined a new political system for Somaliland — a democratic, multi-party system, in which the head of state and members of parliament and district councils would be elected directly by the public by secret ballot, instead of through electoral colleges of elders.

Within two years, a body of laws was passed to facilitate formation of political parties, define citizenship, delineate the structure of local government, and lay down electoral procedures. The laws provided for a seven-member Registration Committee which administered the registration process for political parties as well as the process of qualifying three to become national parties as stipulated by the constitution. The constitutional limitation to the number of national parties was meant to prevent the political system from fracturing along clan or regional lines.

The first local government elections were held In December 2002. Voter registration was only carried out in urban areas, with around 330,000 people being registered. However, on polling day people were allowed to vote irrespective of whether they had a registration card or not (and were then marked with indelible ink).

Six registered political formations qualified to compete in the polls, with the top three in terms of number of seats won recognised as national parties which could field candidates in national elections, including for the position of president. The successful parties were Egal’s UDUB, Kulmiye and UCID. European Union observers declared the elections — during which 440,000 votes were cast — to be “of as high a quality as is realistic within the prevailing environment”.

The presidential polls

In 2003, with the presidential elections fast approaching, President Dahir Riyale Kahin, who had succeeded Egal after the latter’s death in May 2002, met with the three national parties and agreed on the composition of the seven-member National Election Commission. The president and the Guurti would each nominate two commissioners while the political parties would pick one each.

The elections were held on 14 April 2003, pitting President Riyale of UDUB, Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo of Kulmiye and Feisal Ali Hussein of UCID. The result was a wafer-thin victory for the incumbent, who won by just 80 votes out of the 500,000 cast. The Kulmiye Party immediately asked for a recount at some of the polling stations but this did not change the original tally. The result was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court which endorsed Kahin’s victory. Silanyo conceded and Kahin was sworn in on 16 May.

Many who were uncertain and wary of a disputed election and its consequences, expressed gratitude to the Kulmiye leader, Silanyo, for his incredible decision. A seasoned politician, Silanyo had weighed the situation and seen the turmoil that lay ahead. He sacrificed his own political and party ambitions in order to save the fragile democracy. Given that he had served the longest in the SNM leadership and was from the dominant Isaaq clan, Silanyo’s concession removed the latent suspicion that the powerful Isaak would establish hegemony over the other clans.

2005 legislative elections

On 29 September 2005, Somaliland held its first, and so far only, multiparty contest for the 82 parliamentary seats. The 82 members of the house were elected on the basis of proportional representation. UDUB won with 33 seats, Kulmiye garnered 28 and UCID captured 21.

Smarting from their 2003 presidential loss. Kulmiye and UCID blocked or rejected any motion from the executive branch. It was the beginning of political tensions in Somaliland, which crippled the cohesive nature of Somaliland democracy. The parliament elected in 2005 is still glued to their seats because the opposition political majority in the house has continued to filibuster and shoot down any progressive motion pertaining to elections.

He sacrificed his own political and party ambitions in order to save the fragile democracy.

It was only after the 2005 elections that political stakeholders agreed to establish the first voter registry. A law was enacted in 2007 to govern the process and, following some amendments, voter registration proceeded in 2008. It was, however, briefly suspended following suicide bombings in Hargeisa on 29 October 2008, and was also marred by widespread fraud and mismanagement. Nearly 1.3 million names were collected throughout the country, each of which was meant to be validated through a biometric fingerprint system. According to Michael Walls — Co-Coordinator of the international election observation mission for the Somaliland presidential election in 2009 and lecturer at University College London — registration centres permitted more than half of those registering to do so without taking a readable fingerprint and “large numbers were permitted to hold photos in front of the camera rather than presenting themselves for the purpose”.

The 26 June 2010 presidential election

With the term of President Kahin expiring in May 2008, the voter registration exercise was meant to facilitate municipal and presidential elections. However, the polls were repeatedly delayed because of infighting within the higher political circles, specifically between the parliament, opposition leaders and the president, necessitating two extensions of his term. As provided for in the constitution, the Guurti approved the president’s request for an extension of his term and that of parliament to March 2009 due to the instability in the eastern regions. The second extension occurred at the request of the NEC which needed another year to prepare for the polls due to the prevailing political situation, economic problems and technical issues.

The elections were finally held two years late — on 26 June 201 — and were again contested by Kulmiye, UDUB and UCID. Nearly 540,000 voters cast their ballots across the country on election day, electing Kulmiye leader Silanyo, with 50 per cent the vote. It was now Kahin’s turn to gracefully concede and Silanyo was sworn in on July 26 in a ceremony attended by delegations from across East Africa, including officials from Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia.

Local government elections in 2012

On 28 November 2012, Somaliland held its second round of local council elections, the results of which, like the first a decade earlier, would determine the three national political parties that could contest national elections for the next decade. Though largely free and relatively peaceful, the elections were marred by multiple voting exacerbated by the lack of a voter register – the previous one having been nullified by parliament after it defied attempts to clean up the voter roll — and the ease with which supposedly indelible ink was removed.

With two of the three national parties in trouble — many of UCID’s supporters and MPs had transferred their allegiance to Wadani, a new political organisation, while UDUB, the party of the two previous presidents, was widely thought to be dissolving — there was space for new political formations. Five new formations contested the 2012 elections alongside Kulmiye and UCID. Despite some dispute and violence in the immediate aftermath, the results were accepted and Kulmiye, UCID and Wadani emerged as the national political parties.

Presidential elections — 2017

On 13 November 2017, Somaliland conducted its third presidential election, its sixth popular national voting exercise in 15 years. The election — which had originally been scheduled for June 2015 but was delayed, initially at the request of the NEC and then due to the drought ravaging the country in January 2017 — saw three candidates competing to replace the incumbent Silanyo, who had decided to step down: Wadani’s Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi Irro, UCID’s Faisal Ali Warabe, and Kulmiye’s Muse Bihi Abdi. The polls, which were preceded by the rollout of a new biometric voter registration system, experienced considerable delay caused by technical and political challenges, and drought. Compared to over a million in 2010, 873,000 voters were registered, although only just over 700,000 actually collected the voter cards that would allow them to vote.

Once again, peaceful voting was followed by delays in the tabulation and collation of results, and allegations of malpractice. Violence led to some fatalities and the results were disputed, especially by Wadani which demanded a recount but eventually relented. On 21 November, Abdi was declared the winner with 55 per cent of the vote and became the country’s fifth president, cementing a tradition of peaceful handovers of power that is relatively rare in the region.

On November 7th 2020, as the country prepared for the long-delayed parliamentary and municipal elections that are now to be held at the end of May 2021, the National Electoral Commission (NEC) released the timetable for the voter registration exercise that was scheduled to start on November 29th 2020 and end on January 13th 2021. The voter registration exercise targeted those who had missed the 2016 voter registration exercise as well as those who had attained the voting age. The exercise would also be used to clean up the 2016 register. The NEC also gave voters who needed to change voting locations the opportunity to do so and to also replace lost voter cards.

Successes and challenges in the democratisation process

The Somaliland constitution contains fundamental principles strengthening citizens’ rights and freedoms, and emphasises the transition from clan-based politics to a multi-party democracy. However, political parties have not transformed themselves in terms of structure, vision and strategy. Rather than becoming vehicles for transmitting the noble constitutional principles of a multi-party system, in practice they derailed it and became clan-oriented in order to secure more votes. For example, they deferred to clan leaders in the selection of candidates, favouring those from the larger, vote-rich clans, ignoring the smaller ones, and generating conflicts and divisions between them.

The heteromorphic nature of Somali politics and democracy

Somali society is considered ethnically homogenous, monolingual and singularly Islamic. However, it is characterised by an entrenched paternal clan system. These clans are communities of relationships that share common ancestral origins and are interrelated. Clan relations extend over clan territories marked by fluid borders. Upon birth, a Somali is given one name — their first name. The second name is their father’s, the third their paternal grandfather’s and so on and so forth until you arrive at the sub-clan name. Knowing one’s genealogy several generations back is of paramount importance in Somali culture; it is a primary identifier for the individual and the clan. This genealogical identity has been used successfully in Somaliland to curb crime, insecurity and terrorism. It is the most successful approach to community policing.

The clan therefore is at the core of politics in Somali culture. Clan groups became the basis of the political parties for the parliamentarian election in 1964, which meant that from the outset Somalia political parties had a strong clan consciousness. The political system adopted in the 1960s was a clan-based parliamentary democratic system that inevitably led to the politicisation of the clan and the death of ideological politics and democracy.

Clanism, nepotism and patronage

This is the omnipresent danger to all Somali political and democratic initiatives. In such a clan-based political system, the government must have robust and powerful institutions. The governance culture must also emphasise meritocracy over clanism, nepotism and patronage. Governance must be inclusive economically, socially and in terms of development and must be seen to be meritocratic in the filling of public office. The tenets of democracy are optimistic; they envisage a rational human society. But humans are often irrational and their decisions, beliefs and bias is born out of their own selfish interests and desires.

Democracy calls for one man, one vote, and victory to the majority. This is ideal in a democracy that practices ideological politics. But where ideology is replaced by clanism, the majority will always be the most populous clan or the most populous clan alliance. This denies a country visionary leadership because political contests are not based on ideologies, development agenda or unity.

Further, elections in Somaliland have been characterised by unnecessary postponements when politicians are uncomfortable either with the electoral laws or with the appointment of NEC members. For example, the 2008 presidential elections were postponed for two years due to the opposition severely pressuring the incumbent president on controversial issues related to the choice of NEC members.

The political system adopted in the 1960s was a clan-based parliamentary democratic system that inevitably led to the politicisation of the clan and the death of ideological politics.

More recently, between 2017 and 2019, opposition parties UCID and Wadani were at loggerheads with the president over the nomination of the National Electoral Commission. The opposition was challenging the president’s prerogative to increase the number of the NEC commissioners from seven to nine. That dispute led to the postponement of the elections to 2021.

The political parties have truly shackled many opportunities to develop true democracy in Somaliland. The parliamentarians elected in 2005 are still in office 16 years later due to the cycle of postponements driven by political parties. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, however, as new political parties are rising unburdened by the tedious process of using local government elections to select the parties to compete in national elections. The four-year delay in holding the local government elections now means they will be held on the same day as the parliamentary polls.

Due to this, on April 4th 2021 the Somaliland parliament drew up new criteria for identifying national political parties which will now be selected through a separate electoral process in all the six regions. The political organisations that obtain the highest cumulative votes from all six regions will qualify for the three spots, allowing them to run for national elections in future. This elective process for new political parties will most likely be carried out before the expiration of the 10-year period for the current three political parties in November 2022.

Significance of the May 2021 elections

With 1.3 million registered voters (approximately 30 per cent of the population of Somaliland) expected to cast their votes — with 246 candidates gunning for 82 parliamentary seats and 966 vying for 249 district municipality seats in the six regions — these elections will be the most competitive yet. The outgoing parliamentarians were elected in 2005 and sat for 16 years, a decade longer than their mandated term limit. Similarly, the outgoing local government council was elected in 2012. The citizens of Somaliland are determined to bulldoze these unethical politicians. As stated earlier, the dysfunctional political parties are responsible for the postponements, while incumbent presidents have often played the game to gain more time on the throne.

The government will provide at least 80 per cent of the NEC’s budget, with international partners covering the rest. According to the NEC, it will be using biometric voter registration and a sophisticated voting system which university students have trained operate at the polling stations to ensure smooth operations with minimum technical errors and disruptions.

May 31 is of historic significance for Somaliland as it marks the 30th anniversary of Somaliland’s independence and the 20th anniversary of Somaliland’s multiparty democracy. It was on May 31st 2001 that Somaliland voters approved the constitution through a referendum. Somaliland youth born after 1991 have never had a chance to elect their parliamentary representatives.

Which way forward?

If Somaliland’s democratic transition is to last there must be strict regulation of the behaviour of political parties. Moreover, the structure, composition, competence and size of the National Election Commission must be re-evaluated and the best way to do this is to make its membership independent of political parties. The inclusion of political interests in an institution that is supposed to be a neutral adjudicator only destabilises and weakens the NEC with serious repercussions as the constant bickering brought on by political entities diminishes the trust that the electorate has in the organ. Elections are an emotive exercise in Somaliland especially since political compromise and consensus in Somaliland politics is almost absent. Further, the habitual postponing of the elections by the NEC, allowing elected officials to continue to hold seats beyond the end of their terms without the mandate of the electorate is a direct result of the inclusion of political stakeholders within the NEC.

May 31 is of historic significance for Somaliland as it marks the 30th anniversary of Somaliland’s independence and the 20th anniversary of Somaliland’s multiparty democracy.

The elders’ house is aged and incompetent; many of the key members have either died or are crippled. The Guurti is a powerful legal institution but it has not been re-elected since 1993; dead elders are replaced by their next-of-kin regardless of merit. The president must urgently form an ad-hoc commission to study the criteria required to elect the members of the upper house and laws to eradicate the postponement of elections and the extension of political mandates must be put in place.

And finally, mechanisms to engage citizens’ aspirations, to build trust and confidence in the democratisation process, seminars, lectures, debates and discussions may play a vital role, while the involvement of external experts/institutions will be necessary in providing training in democratisation, specifically for the upcoming parliament and the emerging political parties.",2021-05-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['elections', 'vote', 'somalilands', 'parties', 'clan', 'voter', 'journey', 'somaliland', 'political', 'system', 'shukri', 'registration', 'saeed', 'democratic', 'national', 'president', 'unrecognized']",Somalia,news article,English

By Menna A. Farouk

MANSOURIYA, Egypt, Sept 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hassan Abdel Salam knew he was wasting a lot of water every time he flooded his fields to irrigate his mango crop, but wasn't aware of any alternative.

Then the farmer from northern Egypt learned about drip irrigation - putting tiny amounts of water just where it's needed - through a new government scheme.

Now pipes with small holes snake around his 10-feddan (10-acre) farm, dripping water directly to the base of each plant.

Since adopting the method at the start of the year, the 53-year-old said his farm in the village of Mansouriya, near Giza, uses at least 25% less water, fertiliser and energy and his harvests have increased by nearly 20%.

""It was a difficult decision for me at first because I was not familiar with the new system,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""But, when I was told by other farmers that it has a lot of benefits, I started applying it and it turned out to be beneficial, as I was told.""

Abel Salam is among hundreds of farmers in the country's north who have turned to water-saving sprinklers and drip irrigation in the latest phase of a government strategy to reduce water consumption and improve agricultural productivity.

Egypt suffers from significant water shortages, due to the combined effects of climate change, pollution and a growing population with increasing water demands, water and development experts say.

A new mega-dam upstream on the Nile River in Ethiopia also makes the country's access to river water - which it heavily depends on - less certain, officials say.

Negotiations have not yet resulted in an agreement on how much and when the hydropower dam can be filled and discharged.

According to Egypt's statistical agency, about 70% of the country's total water comes from its share of the Nile River, which amounts to 55.5 billion cubic meters a year based on a 1959 deal with upstream Sudan.

Egypt's farmers used more than 61 billion cubic meters of water in the fiscal year 2016/2017, making them by far the biggest water consumers, according to the agency.

But the 1959 deal isn't recognised by Ethiopia, which has now started filling the reservoir behind its new Grand Renaissance Dam.

MORE PEOPLE, LESS WATER

The governments new irrigation initiative, launched in January, is part of a wider 20-year water management plan that started in 2017, said Mohamed el-Sebaei, a spokesman for the water ministry.

The aim is to convert 5 million feddans to drip and sprinkler irrigation, up from the 1 million currently using those methods, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The responsibility for paying for, overseeing and maintaining the switch to more modern irrigation systems falls to the farmers. But to help, the government is offering loans farmers can pay off in instalments, Sebaei said.

Farmers who adopt the new methods will also get smart cards that give access to subsidized fertilizers, pesticides and seeds, he added.

""Through this, we want to encourage farmers to do the transition and lower costs for them,"" the spokesman said.

Agriculture provides work for more than half of Egypt's population, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.

Abbas Sharaky, an associate professor of economic geology at Cairo University, said the fixed amount of water provided in the now-imperiled water-sharing agreement with Sudan is one of the challenges Egypt faces as it tries to tackle its shortages.

With a booming population and generally inefficient water management, that volume of Nile water is no longer enough, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""The population is growing and demand is rising while at the same time the share is the same,"" he said.

The country currently has about 570 cubic meters (150,000 gallons) of water per person per year - just over half of the 1,000 cubic meters hydrologists say is the minimum to avoid water scarcity, according to the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation.

'WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED'

To deal with the growing shortfall, the government is building seawater desalination plants and constructing wastewater recycling facilities, as well as promoting water-smart irrigation, Sebaei said.

Sharaky noted that while sprinklers and drip irrigation can lower water use for many farmers, the techniques cannot be used on farms growing popular crops like wheat and sugarcane.

""The new methods can only be applied to crops of fruits and vegetables...they will not work with other water-hungry crops,"" he said.

Another challenge, Sharaky added, is convincing farmers to pay to switch to the new irrigation methods.

""Farmers are already struggling financially and asking them to pay extra money would increase burdens on them,"" he said.

Sayyed el-Azagi, a tomato farmer in el-Kanater el-Khairia, a city a few kilometres east of the village of Mansouriya, has not made the switch yet, saying it is too expensive.

""Converting from flood irrigation to sprinkler or drip irrigation would cost a lot of money and I am already suffering financially as a farmer. I will never be able to afford that,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The government has given farmers who use older irrigation methods a one-year grace period to move to the new systems or face a fine of 3,600 Egyptian pounds ($230).

According to Sebaei, moving to drip or sprinkler irrigation costs about 5,000-7,000 Egyptian pounds ($315-$445) for each feddan.

""The benefits of converting to these new methods are many and they are worth the money,"" he said.

Abdel Salam, the farmer who made the switch in Mansouriya, said he plans to spread the word to other farmers about how the method has transformed his farm.

""We do not know what tomorrow will bring. We have to be prepared,"" he said.

Pagasa warned residents of the said areas that flash floods or landslides are possible due to moderate to at times heavy rains.

Meanwhile, Metro Manila and the rest of the country will be partly cloudy with chances of isolated rain showers due to localized thunderstorms.

Pagasa said it does not expect a tropical cyclone or weather disturbance near or within the Philippine area of responsibility in the next two to three days.

219,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Battered New York City Looks For Ways to Hold Back the Sea - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/battered_new_york_city_looks_for_ways_to_hold_back_the_sea,"The scenario might have been different: As weather reports confirmed that an incoming nor’easter would drive Hurricane Sandy inland, New York City would have begun watching the rising waters and preparing to respond. When, as predicted, the storm surge showed signs that it would begin to inundate the shorelines of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, the emergency system would have kicked in: Across the Verrazano Narrows entry to New York Harbor, across the upper East River, across the entrance to Jamaica Bay, the floodgates would have begun closing.

Like massive garage doors between pilings 10-stories high, the gates would have fallen into place. In the Verrazano Narrows at the mouth of the harbor, huge gate-like storm barriers, through which ships normally pass, would have pivoted slowly together. Within an hour, the surging seas would have been shut out. Rains and winds would cause their damage, but New York City would have been protected from the storm surge that ended up inundating its vulnerable infrastructure.

In recent years, officials have contemplated such plans as scientists increasingly warned that New York City — and densely populated areas worldwide — faced a growing threat of catastrophic damage from major storms, as sea levels rose and storms, powered by rising ocean and air temperatures, intensified.

Hurricane Sandy has sparked a realization that the defenses of old are no longer adequate.

Then, a week ago, Hurricane Sandy struck, killing 106 people on the U.S. east coast (40 in New York City), causing an estimated $50 billion in damage (roughly $17 billion in New York City alone), and flooding large parts of the region’s infrastructure, including tunnels, subways, and power stations.

Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York City had been working on gradually protecting its infrastructure from the long-term threats of climate change, including a predicted sea level rise of more than three feet this century. But what Hurricane Sandy showed is that New York City may not have the luxury of time. The storm easily overwhelmed many of the relatively minor adaptations that New York had already put in place.

For Malcolm Bowman — an oceanographer at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, and a member of the mayor’s Climate Change Adaptation Task Force — and for other scientists, the destruction wrought by Sandy demonstrates that the time has come for rethinking the city’s strategy. While gradually building resilience into the system is an admirable goal, says Bowman, it can only go so far. “It’s like a boxing match in which you get punched in the nose, return to your corner, patch it up, and get back into the ring,” said Bowman. “But now the city’s been dealt a knockout punch.”

Scientists, engineers, and public officials say that Hurricane Sandy has sparked a realization that the defenses of old are no longer adequate. Whether the “superstorm” was largely the result of the vagaries of weather, or is indicative of a new normal brought on by climate change, officials are warning that New York and other cities can expect more of the same and had better harden their defenses.

“After what has been happening in the last few years, I don’t think anyone can sit back anymore and say, ‘Well, I’m shocked at that weather pattern,’” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last Tuesday. The following day, Cuomo spoke of building sea walls or other protective structures, adding, “Climate change is a reality. Given the frequency of these extreme weather situations we have had, for us to sit here today and say this is once in a generation and is not going to happen again, I think would be shortsighted.”

And Bloomberg, a global leader in helping cities begin to adapt to climate change, said only a few days after the storm, “Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be — given the devastation it is wreaking — should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.”

The question now is, what kind of action? And what lessons should New York City should learn from Hurricane Sandy? The mayor and the governor face a wide array of options, ranging from efforts to recreate marshes and oyster beds along the city’s 510 miles of coastline, to locally protecting infrastructure such as subway stations, to building billion-dollar networks of storm surge barriers.

‘For us to say that this is not going to happen again would be shortsighted,’ said Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

While no one could have predicted the unique meteorological phenomenon that was Sandy, the terrible scenarios that played out as the storm battered the New York City region should have sounded eerily familiar to Mayor Bloomberg, utility companies, and city, state, and federal agencies. The inundated coastline and desperate evacuees, the flooded roads, tunnels, and subways — they’d seen them all in computer models and PowerPoint presentations about the future impacts of climate change, and they had discussed them in interagency meetings with oceanographers, geologists, and climate scientists.

The problem was that what they were seeing was not supposed to be happening now — not for perhaps another 20 years when, they’d been told, rising sea levels due to climate change would turn the storm surges of ordinary nor’easters or low-category hurricanes into devastating tidal torrents.

It wasn’t as if they’d been derelict in starting to plan. New York City and its agencies had consulted an elite group of government and university scientists, economists, and risk management specialists to study how climate change would affect the city. In 2008, the New York Panel on Climate Change concluded that given steadily rising seas, today’s 1-in-100-year flood could occur once every 35 to 55 years by 2050, and once every 15 to 30 years by 2080. The panel also concluded that atmospheric changes would likely increase the intensity of storms and bring more rain to the region.

Recent storms have shown it may be time to consider solutions more in scale with the risks.

With the science in hand, the city formed a Climate Change Adaptation Task Force to determine how best to adapt infrastructure to withstand the effects of future climate challenges. The task force recommended a gradual approach to protecting the city’s assets: improve shoreline land management; consider building new wetlands out into the harbor to better absorb the power of storm surges; and build higher seawalls, jetties, and dykes to protect subway entrances, highway tunnels, and power stations. To keep the costs manageable, these changes would be made gradually. The cost would be in the tens of millions of dollars a year, but given time, New York would become the very model of a “climate-resilient” city that protected its people and its critical infrastructure.

But what recent storms have shown, including Hurricane Irene last year, is that it may be time to consider solutions more in scale with the risks. A decade ago, Bowman’s Storm Surge Research Group at the state university at Stony Brook conceived a system of large barriers and sea walls that would protect the city’s most vulnerable shorelines from storm surges. One would stand by the Whitestone Bridge on the upper East River, another by the eastern entrance to Jamaica Bay, and a third — and most ambitious — would be capable of sealing off the lower harbor and stretch from Brooklyn to Staten Island parallel to the Verrazano Narrows bridge.

One proposal calls for a storm surge barrier across the Verrazano Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island. ARCADIS

Had such a system been in place, says Bowman, it would have stopped Sandy’s storm surge from reaching the city. And though it would have cost some $13 billion, it would have been cheaper than the current estimated damages from Sandy.

These are not untested technologies. Storm surge barriers have protected the Netherlands for centuries, with the most recent built to withstand a 1-in-10,000 year flooding event. Rotterdam began to work on its storm barriers after more than 1,800 people died in a 1953 flood. (The system of dikes, dams, and storm surge barriers is now a major tourist attraction.) St. Petersburg, Russia, last year completed a 15-mile sea surge barrier across the Gulf of Finland. Begun in 1978, it is designed to protect the city from tidal surges up to 16 feet.

Venice is building its own storm surge barriers, and London has a North Sea storm barrier. Examples of storm surge barriers already exist just north of New York City, where they protect the cities of Providence, R.I.; Stamford, Conn.; and New Bedford, Mass. As Sandy’s tidal surge increased, Providence shut the gates on its 3,000-foot long Fox Point Hurricane Barrier. The barrier, said a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman, “performed flawlessly.”

Bowman and colleague Douglas Hill have no illusions that the construction of a system of barriers around New York City will be a quick, easy, or even complete fix. But, says Bowman, it’s time to begin considering this regional approach to flood protection and engage the Army Corps of Engineers, the environmental community, and local and port authorities. These projects, he points out, take decades to build — not because of difficulties with construction, but due to the many studies necessary to reckon with a complex tidal ecosystem.

Piet Dircke of ARCADIS, a Dutch corporation that recently built some of New Orleans’ post-Katrina dikes, also provided Bowman with a rough concept of a storm surge barrier across the Verrazano Narrows, one that would allow for large and small ship traffic and for natural tidal flow when no storms are present. New York City, says Dircke, faces the same problems that climate change poses for delta cities around the world, whether it’s Bangkok, Jakarta, or London. In those cities, as in New York, populations and economic assets are growing (New York City’s economic value grew some 40 percent between 2001 and 2012), while sea level and the threat of catastrophic flooding also rise.",2012-11-06 08:00:00+00:00,"['climate', 'sandy', 'sea', 'hurricane', 'battered', 'ways', 'change', 'city', 'barriers', 'looks', 'york', 'storm', 'hold', 'surge']",India,news article,English

The flood situation in Assam remained grim with the toll touching 66 on Monday following the death of two more persons, as 30.55 lakh people are 18 of the state's 33 districts were affected by the deluge.

The calamity has also claimed the lives of 187 animals, including 16 rhinos in the Kaziranga National Park. However, in another rhino habitat -- the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary -- not a single animal has died in the flood.

The two fresh deaths were reported from Dhubri and Dhemaji districts, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said in its evening bulletin.

Altogether 96,890 displaced persons are sheltered in 757 relief camps and relief distribution centres set up by district administrations, it said.

A total of 2,283 villages and 1.14 lakh hectare agricultural field are still inundated in the flood-hit districts.

In the Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat district, the animal death toll due to drowning includes 15 rhinos, 103 hog deer, one elephant, six swamp deer, 12 sambhar, two water buffaloes, 13 wild boars, three porcupines, a Forest and Environment department release said on Monday.

Another rhino and 10 hog deer also perished due to other reasons, the release said adding 64 animals, including two rhinos, were rescued.

State Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya said the personnel and volunteers at the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary have done an impressive job by keeping the number of the animal death toll at zero this time.

""Their hard work and dedication should be an inspiration for the whole society,"" Suklabaidya said after visiting Pabitoral in Morigaon district and chairing a review meeting.

Meanwhile, the mighty Brahmaputra river is flowing above the danger level at Neamatighat in Jorhat district and Dhubri district, Jia Bharali at N T Road Crossing in Sonitpur district and Kopili at Dharamtul in Nagaon district, the ASDMA said.

1607,FL-2021-000030-IDN,41 killed in landslides and floods in Indonesia; dozens missing - NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/41-killed-landslides-floods-indonesia-dozens-missing-n1262997,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Landslides and flash floods from torrential rains in eastern Indonesia killed at least 41 people and displaced thousands, the country's disaster relief agency said Sunday. More than two dozen others were still missing.

Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills onto dozens of homes in Lamenele village shortly after midnight on Adonara island in East Nusa Tenggara province. Rescuers recovered 35 bodies and at least five injured, said Lenny Ola, who heads the local disaster agency.

Flash flooding killed at least six people elsewhere, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Relief efforts were hampered by power cuts, blocked roads covered in thick mud and debris as well as the remoteness of the area surrounded by choppy seas and high waves, said the agency's spokesperson, Raditya Jati.

Seasonal downpours cause frequent landslides and floods, killing dozens each year in Indonesia, a chain of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.

Indonesia's disaster agency lowered the death toll late Sunday to 41 — down from 44 — after search and rescue team reverified victims’ data. At least 27 people were still missing.

The bodies of three people were recovered after being swept away by floods in Oyang Bayang village, where 40 houses were also destroyed, Ola said. Hundreds of people fled submerged homes, some of which were carried off by the floodwaters.

In another village, Waiburak, three people were killed and seven remained missing when overnight rains caused rivers to burst their banks, sending muddy water into large areas of East Flores district, Ola said. Four injured people were being treated at a local health clinic.

Hundreds of people were still involved in the rescue efforts as of late Sunday, Jati told a press conference. At least six villages have been affected by flash floods and a landslide that cut five bridges on the island, he said.

Photos released by the agency showed rescuers and police and military personnel taking residents to shelters.

Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas, Jati said. Severe flooding also has been reported in Bima, a town in the neighboring province of West Nusa Tenggara, forcing nearly 10,000 people to flee.

1093,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Marked increase in Nile flooding in October: committee - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/flooding-of-the-nile-river-increased-in-october-committee/,"The permanent Committee for Regulating the Revenue of the Nile River said on Sunday that the flooding of the Nile increased in October following average flooding rates from January until August.

Egypt’s Ministry of Irrigation noted that increasing flooding rates improve water quality by achieving environmental balance and disposing of the pollutants in the Nile River.

During a meeting with Minister of Irrigation Mohammed Abdel Atty and the National Water Research Center, the committee presented the 2019 Nile flooding situation and explained the flood’s impacts on the total water resources in Egypt.

The committee explained water management and distribution mechanisms and measures of rehabilitating and upgrading the outlets of the canals.

Abdel Atty said in 2018 that 114 billion cubic meters of water are required to meet the country’s agricultural, industrial, drinking, and home usage needs.

During the Supreme Council of Culture’s “Water and Sustainable Development” symposium, Abdel Atty said that Egypt suffers from a 54 billion cubic meter water shortage. Egypt’s usable water, coming from the Nile River, precipitation and groundwater, only reached 60 billion cubic meters.

Abdel Atty added that Egypt currently makes up for water shortages through the reuse of agricultural drainage water, of which 20 billion cubic meters is available, accounting for 33 percent of the total usable water. Meanwhile, the country needs 34 billion cubic meters to produce food stuff rather than importing it.

1672,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Raw material and finished goods — changing dynamics amid climate push - The Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/raw-material-and-finished-goods-changing-dynamics-amid-climate-push/2225803/,"Steel industry in China has performed well in the Covid 19 pandemic year with a 5.2% rise in production (@1053MT) in 2020 and a projected growth of 8% in steel consumption at 980.1 MT, according to WSA.

For any commodity it is universally true that raw material availability, its quality and price provide fundamental basis for the pricing of the finished products. Any risk associated with the input materials are perceived with utmost concern. In the recent past, both in the world market and inside the country, these types of events get major media publicity which in a way influence the marketing of the finished goods. It is fair to assume that supply scenario of the finished products also influences the demand and price of the raw materials and in a way, both are correlated.

Thus as the report on heavy rains and flood leading to the closure of the main rail link to Newcastle port and disruption of rail link to export terminals in South Africa have been made public, Indian buyers of thermal coal were looking for alternate sources of supply like Indonesia and coal prices started to move up. It is apparent that premium low vol coking coal HCC which sharply came down from $160.5/T FOB Australia in Jan’21 to $112/T in 4th week of March’21 may move further northward in the coming weeks.

The environmental push by the Chinese government in specific provinces (Tangshan etc.) may impose production ban on polluting industries and lead to supply constraints. However, as the overall demand scenario in China is good buoyed by stimulus measures and easing of the property market, the demand for merchant iron ore by China would continue unabated, thereby sustaining iron ore prices (current price CFR Chinese port $ 164.8/T) with marginal rise in H1 of 2021.

Current projections uniformly expect a contraction of demand and production in China in 2021. If this takes place, it would cause significant flutter in the trading price of iron ore.

Steel industry in China has performed well in the Covid-19 pandemic year with a 5.2% rise in production (@1053MT) in 2020 and a projected growth of 8% in steel consumption at 980.1 MT, according to WSA. In the first two months of 2021 the Chinese production (175MT) has grown by as high as 12.9% with a corresponding positive push to steel consumption.

Although production restriction on account of environmental reasons in the current year may lead to correction in provincial performance, degrowth in total production volume in 2021 which is predicted by most of the analysts may not come true. And therefore the estimates by WSA at keeping the consumption in 2021 at the same level in 2020 does not seem to be warranted as of now. The share of China in global steel consumption which started at 16.6% at the beginning of the century has already reached 54.6% share (India: 5.6%) in total consumption.

Another aspect arising out of this interdependence of raw materials and finished products, global and domestic, relates to the perception of the various players. For instance, when the global price of a commodity rises due to supply constraint or higher demand, the message to the producers of similar product in the domestic market is a positive signal towards raising the prices irrespective of the quantum. The oft-repeated import parity is a well established phenomenon that is called upon for justification. Needless to mention this is applicable to commodities that are regularly traded in the global market.

The other part is through direct import of the commodity which now becomes costlier to put pressure on the similar goods in the domestic market for price push. In the event of rise in global prices of specific commodities, there exists a sense of relative deprivation on the part of the domestic players, and this is most important, there is no demand shrinkage for the product.

Technology has a significant role to play in influencing the prices of raw materials and finished goods. It is anticipated that use of fossil fuel would undergo a paradigm shift in the coming decade.

Coal based power and steel, as it causes environmental problem, would be substituted by renewable energy and alternative routes for steel making like syn gas (coal syn gas, natural gas) and hydrogen based. The demand for metallurgical coal would be reduced over the years, while demand for non-coking coal for generation of syn gas for DRI and other downstream industries like Chemical and fertiliser would still be there.

Increasing use of scrap (incentivised by vehicle scrappage policy and setting up of scrap processing centres) by furnaces would enhance EAF capacities relatively more compared to BF-BOF process. A time is fast approaching when export products entering markets in EU and other regions would have to pass through rating benchmarked on CO2 emission levels.

Photo by VnExpress/Huu Khoa.

With Storm Molave set to make landfall in central Vietnam in the next few days, Vietnamese authorities are preparing to evacuate 1.2 million coast residents to safety.

At 1 p.m. Monday, the storm lay centered around 560 km east-northeast of Southwest Cay islet, with winds of 135 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.

Over the next 24 hours, it will move west at 20-25 kph and gradually intensify. At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, it will be 280 km to the north of Southwest Cay with winds of up to 150 kph.

Mai Van Khiem, director of the national forecast center, said at a meeting Monday both the agency and its Japanese counterpart predict the rapidly moving storm would make landfall in central Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces.

The agencies forecast the storm would reach Vietnamese shores on Wednesday morning, before making landfall in the coming hours.

On Wednesday morning, the storm's center would be around 200 km from the coast of Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh with a maximum wind speed of 135 kph, causing waves of up to 10 m.

Storm circulation combined with a cold spell would cause heavy rains on a large scale, and localities stretching over 1,000 km from Nghe An to Phu Yen will be battered by torrential downpours and strong winds from Tuesday until Thursday, with rainfall of between 200-400 mm.

Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh are told to brace for prolonged downpours until Saturday with total rainfall of up to 700 mm. Rainfall of 180 mm a day is considered heavy.

Mountainous areas will be at high risk of landslides.

Mass evacuation

Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, said with Molaves strength level, the committee is ready to evacuate over 1.2 million residents in seven central provinces Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh.

The region, home to popular ancient towns, beautiful beaches and world famous caves, has been bombarded by historic flooding and deadly landslides for the past three weeks, suffering damage government officials described as ""the worst in five years."" At least 130 people have been killed by floods and landslides between October 6 and 25.

Hoai urged provincial leaders to stay in contact with fishing boats, evacuate residents to safety, and make plans to limit storm damage.

There are still 65,000 fishing boats operating along the central coast, of which 45,000 have received official warnings.

""The storm is too strong,"" Hoai said, ordering localities to order boats to take shelter, ban residents from fishing activities, and close all public beaches by Tuesday night.

Vietnams Ministry of National Defense has called for the mobilization of more than 368,000 people - soldiers, members of the police force, and civilian volunteers, to assist residents in at-risk areas.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the meeting that localities must be on high alert and prepare their best flood prevention measures.

""If the storm comes as strong as forecast, damage from rains and floods will be extremely huge,"" Phuc said.

According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Storm Molave's strength is equivalent to Storm Damrey, which hit south central Vietnam in November 2017 and killed 106 people.

US donates flood relief aid

The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has provided an additional $875,000 in humanitarian assistance for the World Food Programme (WFP) to strengthen preparation and response to natural disasters in Cambodia.

In a press statement released by WFP on April 1, US ambassador to Cambodia Patrick Murphy said that last year’s devastating floods demonstrated how important it was to be ready for natural disasters.

“This funding from USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance will enable the UN World Food Programme to further build upon the successes of its ‘Innovations for Risk Informed Emergency Preparedness and Response’ project – which USAID began supporting in 2019 – through March 2022,” he said.

WFP country director in Cambodia Claire Anne Conan thanked USAID for this additional support to Cambodia, which faced recurrent, climate-related disasters such as floods and droughts.

“This assistance will help government partners and humanitarian groups at the national and sub-national level to better prepare for and respond to these events by increasing the use of information for early action and enhancing humanitarian coordination,” she said.

National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) spokesman Khun Sokha said the WFP assistance would help the government aid drought victims and the poor.

“The WFP has helped people with food including the poor. This assistance was not only provided through NCDM, but also through other institutions involved in this work,” he said.

Chou Chea, WFP communication and report officer in Cambodia, told The Post on April 1 that this assistance would be used for existing mechanisms to enhance the national disaster management information system – Platform for Real-Time Impact and Situation Monitoring. It will be spent on increasing the platform’s ability to monitor climate-related problems, estimate their impact on the population and target emergency assistance to where it is needed most.

The WFP, she said, will support an existing early warning flood system called EWS1294 to help expand its coverage and strengthen the ability of local officials and at-risk communities to use the information to save lives.

WFP will also continue its support for the Humanitarian Response Forum (HRF), an interagency, multi-sector platform that facilitates emergency preparedness and response activities among humanitarian groups to complement the government’s nationally-led activities.

She added that the assistance would also help existing projects for a year starting April.

Last year, the US donated $700,000 to WFP to help flood-affected communities in Cambodia.

Cambodia suffered prolonged floods in 2020 with the capital and at least 18 provinces across the countries impacted, causing 25 deaths and affecting more than 300,000 people, according to NCDM report released last October.",2021-04-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['help', 'information', 'response', 'ncdm', 'usaid', 'aid', 'humanitarian', 'wfp', 'cambodia', 'flood', 'donates', 'relief', 'support', 'assistance']",India,news article,English
1322,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How much will the eastern Canada flooding cost? - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/catastrophes/the-estimated-economic-losses-from-eastern-canada-flooding-1004163076/,"Total economic losses from the recent flooding in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick are expected minimally to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars (U.S.), Aon’s latest catastrophe report said.

The flooding event has already been declared a catastrophe event, meaning at least $25 million in insured damage, Catastrophe Indices and Quantification Inc. (CatIQ) confirmed Friday.

“Due to the relatively low overland flood insurance take-up, a sizeable portion of the economic cost was expected to be uninsured,” said the Global Catastrophe Recap for April, released Thursday by Aon’s Impact Forecasting cat model development team.

According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), the take-up rate for overland flood insurance in Quebec was about 33% in 2017. Statistics for Ontario and New Brunswick were not available by press time.

Flooding occurred in late April and early May. The combination of increasing temperatures and heavy rainfall during the second half of April and extending into May exacerbated the seasonal spring flood situation across the St. Lawrence, Ottawa and St. John River basins, the Aon report said. These river overflows led up to 10,000 homes incurring flood inundation, with most of the worst impacts registered in southern Quebec.

In late April, water from the Lake of Two Mountains burst through a natural dike in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, inundating the suburb west of Montreal. Many homes flooded in the suburb will be total losses and may not have overland flood coverage, Michel Lachelle, vice president of organizational services in eastern Canada for ClaimsPro/IndemniPro, said May 1. The adjusting firm was involved in about 2,000 flood claims from April in Quebec alone, Lachelle said at the time.

The Canadian Press reported Friday that “water levels are expected to rise again this weekend between Ottawa and Montreal, even as New Brunswick’s floods are effectively over.” The City of Ottawa, which has been in a state of emergency since Apr. 25, confirmed water levels are expected to rise in the city. Water levels to the west of Ottawa (between Mattawa and Lac Deschenes) will also rise this weekend and the peak could exceed maximum levels earlier this spring, and even previous historical highs.",2019-05-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['ottawa', 'water', 'rise', 'levels', 'catastrophe', 'quebec', 'canada', 'overland', 'flood', 'cost', 'expected', 'eastern', 'flooding', 'insurance']",Canada,news article,English
504,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Dossier: the return of hunger - Geographical,https://geographical.co.uk/people/item/4051-dossier-the-return-of-hunger,"The decades-long decline in hunger has now ended, despite the fact that we produce enough food to feed the global population. What can be done?

A hungry man, goes the adage, is an angry man. Perhaps it was with this in mind that the Norwegian Nobel Committee handed its 2020 Peace Prize not to a person but to the world’s largest humanitarian organisation, the World Food Programme (WFP). The gesture was in recognition of the WFP’s efforts and of the knotty relationship between famine, food and conflict, but it also acknowledged the daunting to-do list faced by the UN’s most overworked logistics arm. There is, David Beasley, the head of the WFP, recently warned, ‘a lot of bad coming our way’.

A decades-long decline in hunger in the world has unfortunately ended and the WFP openly speaks of an unfolding ‘hunger pandemic’, exacerbated by climate change, Covid-19 and, above all, political unrest. ‘It’s good to be recognised, but we know the prize is a call to arms,’ says Arif Husain, chief economist at the WFP. ‘The job is far from done. It’s a shame in the 21st century in a globalised world with such wealth that we are still talking about trying to give people a decent meal once a day. We’re not asking for the moon.’

According to the WFP, in 2017, 80 million people faced imminent starvation; by 2020, this had risen to 135 million; in 2021, it already stands at 270 million. These aren’t people just going to bed hungry (that number, this year, is 690 million, or one in nine people on the planet, 414 million of them women and girls, according to Action Against Hunger [AAH]). Every 13 seconds, according to AAH, somewhere on the planet a child dies from hunger or a hunger-related disease. In 2019, that added up to a total of 2.3 million children.

‘Famine has continued into the 21st century, long after it should have been eradicated,’ says Stephen Devereux, a fellow at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex and a director of the Centre for Social Protection. The fear of the 1970s, that we genuinely might not have enough food to feed a growing global population, has long gone, he says. ‘The Green Revolution saw to that. We have capacity to move food from surplus to those areas with a deficit. We have early warning systems of drought and other extreme weather.’

Four famines have been declared by the UN in the 21st century, the most recent of which, in Somalia in 2011, left 260,000 dead – an estimated 4.6 per cent of the total population and up to 18 per cent of children under five in some regions. Earlier this year, the UN warned that Yemen (see box on page 22) faced the prospect of the worst famine the world had seen in decades, with distressing reports that 400,000 children there were severely malnourished, ‘and as a result are in their last weeks and months’.

Long-term conflicts are now really biting, says Husain. ‘The world has been in turmoil for some time – Syria for ten years, Yemen for five years, South Sudan for ten years and northeast Nigeria for seven years.’ Conflict continues to apply pressure in many corners of the world. In northern Mozambique in the past year alone, 565,000 people have been displaced and pushed into food insecurity by attacks by non-state armed groups.

And, like a Russian matryoshka doll, hunger is merely the outer shell around deeper problems. According to the WFP, about one in three people in 55 of the world’s poorest countries suffer from some form of malnutrition, caused by lack of access to healthy food, poor healthcare systems and unhealthy environments. Five years after the world committed to the concept of zero hunger by 2030 (enshrined as Goal 2 of the 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development), we’re way off track. The same goes for the ambition of ensuring good health and nutrition for the first 1,000 days of a child’s life (from conception, nine months gestation and the first two years or so after birth), which would prevent stunting and promote healthy development. Two billion people, or 26 per cent of the global population, lacked regular access to nutritious and sufficient food in 2019. According to AAH, a child with severe acute malnutrition is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child. In 2019, 21.3 per cent (144 million) of children under five were estimated to be stunted (low height-for-age), 6.9 per cent (47 million) wasted (low weight-for-height). Meanwhile, 5.6 per cent (38.3 million) were overweight.

The price of food



The WFP’s 2020 Cost of a Plate of Food report highlights the countries in which a simple meal such as rice and beans costs the most when compared with people’s incomes. South Sudan came top of the list, with basic ingredients costing an eye-watering 186 per cent of a person’s daily income. If a resident in New York State had to pay the same proportion of their salary for a basic meal, the food would cost US$393. In New York State, ingredients for a simple meal – perhaps a soup or a simple stew – costs just 0.6 per cent of someone’s income.



Seventeen of the top 20 countries featured in the index are in sub-Saharan Africa, including Burundi (US$91); Malawi (US$74); Sudan (US$61); and Mali (US$49). Other countries with high food costs include Pakistan (US$16) and Haiti, where people spend more than a third of their daily income on a single plate of food.



Development agencies use a metric known as the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) to quantify whether people are eating enough. The PoU in Africa was 19.1 per cent of the population in 2019, more than 250 million undernourished people, up from 17.6 per cent in 2014, double the world average. Even for the many who do get enough food to keep them alive there is the question of monotony – the same meal of rice and beans for 30 days straight, or longer. The situation is sufficiently dire that, incredibly, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) felt it necessary to declare – without irony – 2021 to be the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables. All this in a world where one third of the food we produce is wasted.

Antidote democracy

So why, given international awareness, food networks and early warning systems, do famines still occur? Simon Levine, senior research fellow in the Humanitarian Policy Group at the Overseas Development Institute, puts it bluntly: ‘Famine is about war, politics and denying people food.’ Shocking as this sounds, just about everyone in development and humanitarian circles agrees and sees this observation as uncontroversial. ‘Famine is anything but pre-ordained. You can sum it up in one word: politics,’ says Devereux.

There is, he adds, no longer such a thing as a ‘Biblical famine’. ‘You can get drought, crops fail and it’s all a catastrophic failure,’ he says. ‘But to say drought causes famines nowadays isn’t a good enough explanation. That doesn’t apply in the modern world. We have crises where people can’t grow their own food or rear livestock and don’t have enough money to buy food in markets when prices spike, but usually, in most cases, the WFP or the government can deliver food. The critical question isn’t why famines happen, but why they aren’t prevented.’

True famine occurs when this system of intervention breaks down. ‘Either the government doesn’t have the capacity or the political will, or the international community has a problem with the government of the country,’ says Devereux, who points to the mid-1980s famine in Ethiopia that killed one million people, affected eight million others and prompted the Live Aid concerts. ‘The Marxist government [in Ethiopia] actually bombed the food markets; drought was used as a weapon.’ Devereux endorses international pressure that ratchets up accountability for famine prevention. ‘If famine happens, someone has allowed it to happen. We saw that with Al-Shabab [an Islamist militant group in Somalia], which prevented aid getting to areas in which it was needed in Somalia in 2011. That cost 250,000 lives. The capacity to prevent famine is there, the problem is faulty security and conflict.’

Levine looks back to Ethiopia in the 1980s and notes that ‘there was a drought, but its effects were intensified by a civil war. It wasn’t random who died – those at the bottom of society died.’ He points out that there was a 30 per cent drop in food production not only in Ethiopia but also in Uganda at the same time. ‘But you don’t hear about the Great Uganda Famine, because there wasn’t one. If the UK ever faced the same problem, the government of the day would import more food and stick a couple of pence on income tax to pay for it later.’

The issue, Levine suggests, is more about wider political accountability. ‘There has never been a famine in a country with a free press.’ Devereux agrees, drily noting that ‘democracy is a good antidote to famine.’

Long-term strategies needed

While politics is generally the catalyst that can tip a region or country into famine, Jon Cunliffe, Middle East regional director for Action Against Hunger, believes that the underlying rhythms of subsistence farming provide the opportunity for vulnerable people to be exploited. Cunliffe refers to ‘the hunger gap’ – the period of time between a crop being planted and it being harvested. ‘For a subsistence farmer, any change during this period puts them at risk,’ he says. ‘They don’t have assets to draw on – if they have nothing to sell, they become at risk of famine.’ Often, erratic weather is the final straw that tips livelihoods that were already acutely vulnerable over the edge. ‘Politics can make that vulnerability much more exaggerated. If a country has functioning governance, then climate change can be mitigated more effectively.’

Yet there remain unrelenting pressures on food security that leave communities vulnerable to the politics of the day. As Husain puts it, ‘In any given place, it’s never a single thing – conflict and climate come together.’ According to AAH, severe drought is a leading cause of undernutrition in more than a third of countries that have seen a rise in hunger levels in the past 15 years. Droughts lead to steep falls in food production, which means less income for small producers and higher food prices – putting a healthy diet beyond reach for the poorest people. ‘The days of saying climate change is a hoax are over. It’s here and it’s real,’ says Husain. ‘We see shrinking growing seasons, with real consequences for subsistence farmers and those in the rural economy.’

Levine argues that what’s really being talked about – and needs to be addressed – is food insecurity. ‘Hundreds of millions of people face food insecurity all the time,’ he says. ‘It means a daily struggle, not quite enough food, very unpleasant trade-offs, such as kids not going to school because what little money a family has must go on food. But that’s not starvation and it’s not famine – it’s desperate poverty. The reality is that millions have always gone to bed hungry. We’re simply getting a new appreciation of the way people have been living for ages.’

While conflict and climate change have long affected people’s ability to produce or afford food to feed their families, Covid-19 has now added another layer to the challenges faced by most vulnerable groups, through increased unemployment, loss of remittances and weak economies. ‘The problem is that you can’t lay famine at the doorstep of Covid – things have been unravelling for a few years,’ says Husain. ‘What Covid did was to double the numbers of people facing famine.’

Longer-term solutions include development of sustainable domestic food markets, social protection schemes and, simply put, more employment. In 2005, India passed the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act that ensured people in rural areas 100 days work at a minimum wage every year. Policies like these ‘helped ensure that countries such as Bangladesh, Russia, China and India have left behind the horrific famines that they endured during the 20th century,’ says Levine. Grass roots social-protection schemes create a snowball effect, adds Husain. ‘If you give money to people who need things, they will spend that money, not save it. That creates jobs and incentives to produce food to sell.’

Measures such as cash payments and early warning systems, innovative when they first emerged, are now established as mitigation techniques. Artificial intelligence and satellite mapping are also making a huge difference. In Bangladesh, hit this year by floods that covered a quarter of the country, early-warning systems provided four days’ notice of the coming deluge. This triggered anticipatory payouts – cash delivered via mobile phones through a social-safety-net programme – that gave 20,000 families the resources to move their valuables out of harm’s way. ‘The aid community has got a lot better,’ says Levine. ‘It’s not just about throwing sacks of maize out of the back of a plane. We’re pretty good at stopping people dying in large numbers.’

As with many public health measures, the world doesn’t tend to notice when something terrible is averted ahead of time. In 2019–20, there were apocalyptic warnings of desert locusts that were destroying crops in East Africa, putting five million people at risk of famine in the worst infestation for 70 years. ‘But the desert locust famine never happened – the international community responded,’ says Devereux. Interventions included manual and aerial spraying of pesticides. Grants, including US$500 million from the World Bank, enabled countries to provide immediate support to affected households through social safety nets such as cash transfers, while investing in the medium-term recovery of agriculture and livestock production systems and rural livelihoods.

Longer-term strategies, as well as short-term pre-emptive measures, are required but will necessitate a change in mentality from the international community, suggests Cunliffe. ‘It’s not just governments that work on short-term election cycles – most development projects only last one or two years,’ he says. ‘This can’t be about the white aid worker flying in to save a country – it’s about building up partnerships and the long-term capacity within a country. You need to build skills and governance. Education is fundamental, that is what pulls a country out of a dire situation.’

Education is one of several major components that, if put in place, make the prospect of famine recede, says Husain. In addition, he highlights the empowerment of women, social protection schemes and investment in rural infrastructure, such as feeder roads, internet access and electricity. ‘If you don’t put the access in place, why would a food producer do anything more than produce at subsistence level?’ he asks. ‘People talk about equality of income, but it’s more about equality of opportunity. If you build a road, you give someone the means to take their food to market.

‘It’s a long piece of work, the results won’t be seen by the politicians who begin the process, so it’s a question of political will. But we know it works – we saw this after the Second World War, when the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan were on their knees.’

Yemen



By any measure, Yemen is the world’s worst on-going humanitarian crisis. At the time of writing, 13 million people out of a population of 29 million are being helped by the WFP. By June 2021, this figure, AAH projects, will rise to 15.5 million. Across Yemen, five million people are ‘just one step away from famine,’ according to the UN.



‘What we’re looking at with Yemen is a famine that could unfold on the scale of nothing we’ve seen since the 1970s and Biafra,’ says Cunliffe. An embargo by Saudi Arabia and the UAE means that it has become all but impossible to deliver food aid to a country that, even before the latest crisis, relied on imports for 80 per cent of its food.



‘Yemenis are either selling assets to buy food or have sold all their assets and have no money to buy food, or there is no food to buy,’ says Cunliffe. ‘The government has collapsed, the health system has collapsed, there’s no social protection, there’s no access to potable water. We’re seeing the return of diseases that had been eradicated, such as dengue, malaria and leishmaniasis. There are hundreds of thousands of cases of cholera.’



UN agencies and NGOs such as AAH are simply unable to deal with 15 million people in such extreme need of help, warns Cunliffe. He points to the root causes: conflict and key actors refusing to allow aid to enter the country. ‘The only thing you can push for is some sort of peace agreement and then allow aid relief and trade to resume. It’s very frustrating – this was not pre-ordained.’



In March, the UN hoped to raise US$3.85 billion from more than 100 governments and donors at a virtual pledging conference to avert widespread famine in Yemen but received only US$1.7 billion – less than half of what was needed. ‘Millions of Yemeni children, women and men desperately need aid to live. Cutting aid is a death sentence,’ António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said.



The benefits of peace

The WFP says that each dollar of spending on long-term initiatives can save three dollars in humanitarian aid, as well as avoiding disruption and losses for families. ‘We always talk about the cost of doing something – we should be talking about the costs if we don’t do it,’ says Husain. ‘It’s to our collective benefit that we sort these things out. If we don’t address these issues, you see famine and migration. If people stay in their own country, you pay US$90 per capita [to improve things]; if they migrate to, say, Europe, it costs US$4,500 per capita.’

Husain’s concern is that Covid-19-era financial belttightening will make problems even worse. ‘In the past 12 months, governments have spent US$20 trillion on Covid – that’s 20 per cent of global GDP,’ he says. ‘The problem is not going away, but from now on, we have less capacity, less money to deal with it. Just when needs are increasing, we’re getting a financial crunch – that’s where the “bad” comes in. There’s not much leverage left.’

Leverage of one means or another is going to be needed, with the WFP forecasting that if nothing changes, the number of undernourished people will exceed 840 million by 2030. Right now, we live in a world that produces enough food to feed its entire population but where more than 1.5 billion people can’t afford a diet that meets the required levels of essential nutrients; and more than three billion people can’t even afford the cheapest healthy diet.

While Covid has set back progress, Cunliffe believes that forward momentum is irreversible. ‘I have to be optimistic,’ he says. ‘Great progress had been made pre-Covid, but Covid is a significant hole in the road and it may take more than ten years to get back on track.’

There is room for optimism, Devereux points out. ‘The Horn of Africa and Yemen are probably the last famine-prone regions in the world,’ he says. ‘That is a good advance on 100 years ago.’ Nor, he emphasises, are the solutions particularly complex: ‘Healthy diets, nutrition, employment schemes… we know what works.’ Yet he tempers his optimism when he turns to the question of whether famine will ever cease to be a political tool. ‘As long as there are conflicts, people will lose access to food and there is a choice those in power make as to what happens next.’

It would be naïve, suggests Levine, to assume that enlightened governments will always prevail. ‘You can argue about what is really needed to address food insecurity: whether it’s more deregulation to create jobs, more tax to provide support. Those are routine debates,’ he says. ‘But we need to think more about poverty and inequality in the long term and that’s where political will comes in. Allowing a famine to happen – that is a direct choice that governments make.

‘I would love there to be a silver bullet, a miracle crop that will get rid of hunger, but those wouldn’t get us off the hook,’ he continues. ‘There has to be a mood for change. You have to fight hard just to stand still – there will always be new wars, new warlords.’

However, claiming ignorance, or just standing by, is no longer an excuse, suggests Husain. ‘In previous centuries, when these things were isolated, we didn’t know until after the event that famine happened, but we can’t say that any more. The tangible benefits of peace are bigger to a larger group of people than the benefits of war to a smaller group of people. We can change the world for the better; we need to get the “wrong” right.’

Women and hunger



Inequalities that exist within families or communities, for example because of age or gender, have a huge impact on malnutrition levels. Women and girls often eat last and least. Girls might be attracted to, or pushed into, early marriage, while boys separated from their families during an economic migration might slide into malnutrition if they can’t care for themselves, warns Action Against Hunger. In the south of Madagascar, for example, girls and women lose most of their decision-making powers upon the payment of dowry.



Women generally have smaller and less muscular bodies than men and need about 25 per cent less energy per day. However, they require the same amount of nutrients, which means they need to eat more nutrient- rich foods than men. But this is often unaff ordable as foods rich in nutrients – such as fruit, vegetables and meat – tend to be the most expensive foods.



Pregnant and breastfeeding women need to consume foods even richer in nutrients to maintain their energy and nutrition levels. Lack of access to a healthy diet puts pregnant women at greater risk of complications during pregnancy and birth. Many infant and young child deaths in developing countries are the result of the poor nutritional health of their mothers. Teenage mothers and their babies are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. In Bangladesh, stunted growth has been linked to the heavy workload of women living in Rohingya refugee settlements, while women’s low levels of decision making is a major factor in undernutrition among children in Uganda.



In one project, which aims to empower women to become community health workers, Action Against Hunger seeks to bridge the gap between communities and the health system, trying to ensure that community health workers have the skills to both diagnose and treat malnutrition cases in the villages where they live and work. By going from mother to mother, home to home, they can reach more children and provide them with care and treatment and, ultimately, save lives.

844,DR-2011-000121-CHN,City of Zibo has its eye on new materials|Zibo Special|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-09/03/content_13610594.htm,"City of Zibo has its eye on new materials Updated: 2011-09-03 07:49 By Zhao Ruixue (China Daily)

Prominent scientist Shi Changxu (left) presenting a plaque to Zibo's Party chief, Liu Huiyan, on behalf of the Chinese Materials Research Society, proclaiming Zibo a 'New Materials City'.

Zibo's new materials industry saw robust growth throughout 2010, thanks to the city's effort to develop high-tech industries, especially new materials.

The sector has 561 related enterprises and had an industrial output value of more than 181 billion yuan last year.

Thanks to that, Zibo was declared a New Materials City by the Chinese Materials Research Society, in September 2010.

Actually, this started much earlier. Back in 2002, the Ministry of Science and Technology had already designated the city as a new materials commercialization and industrialization center.

Now, after almost a decade of growth, Zibo has several new material areas focusing on advanced ceramics, new chemical materials and heat-resistant products.

In the chemical materials sector alone, it has 188 enterprises with various products, a number of which have the largest market share for their type in China.

Some analysts have said that the city's production capacity for pollution-free refrigerants, plastic agents and fireproof fiber are in the lead in Asia.

What is driving the boom in new materials is a large amount of investment in R&D. The city has 70 research centers and enterprise technology centers, five of them at the State-level and 50 at the provincial-level, as well as 11 post-doctoral research sites.

A number of its companies and institutions own the intellectual property rights to key technologies and products. For instance, in the ceramics industry, companies have at least 200 patents, three of them at the State-level. The products covered by these patents cover a wide range, such as the aerospace, defense, and nuclear energy sectors.

The city has cultivated several leading brands, including Huaguang, a leading name in household chinaware.

The Great Hall of the People, on Tiananmen Square, the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, and Zhongnanhai - the central government complex - have used its high-purity quartz products for several years.

In addition, low-iron glass products from Zibo's Jinjing Group have been used on Trains on the Tibet line and at a number of Beijing Olympic facilities, such as the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube. Its window glasses see wide use in many landmark buildings.

Another contributor to Zibo's new materials development is the annual China (Zibo) International New Materials Technological Forum, which opened in 2002.

This is a forum for sharing the latest technological innovations and has given both the city's economy and its international reputation a great boost.

The last nine forums attracted a large number of academics and industry professionals from more than 30 countries and, witnessed the signing of 5,155 technological project agreements.

Thanks to its good environment, Zibo has ranked among China's 'garden cities' for many years now. Hou Heliang / for China Daily

Big Picture

""We can do a CSK"" is the line coming out of the Kolkata Knight Riders' camp. However, in contrast to the consistent performances from more than one player that took Chennai Super Kings to consecutive titles in 2010 and 2011, Knight Riders have their shortcomings, evident during their dismal run during last year's Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa, where they earned a solitary (and irrelevant) victory before making an exit.

Annoyingly for Knight Riders, the difficult questions continue to persist. Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, the top two run-makers for Knight Riders, are fighting their individual battles to stay fit and find form. Gambhir, who is also the Knight Riders' captain, remains unsettled after a prolonged drought of runs that forced the Indian selectors to drop him for the home Test series against Australia last month. This tournament will be a litmus test for a cricketer well-known for his determination and character.

The IPL would be the first time Kallis plays active cricket since pulling a hamstring before the final match of the home Test series against Pakistan in February. Kallis who has had several niggles in the past year, failed to excel even in home conditions during the Champions League, compiling just 18 runs. He then failed during the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, managing 24 runs in three innings across five matches.

The concerns only heighten with Brendon McCullum yet to join the squad as he is recovering from a hamstring injury. In any case McCullum's stint this season is a short one, since he is scheduled to depart after first week of May to lead New Zealand on their tour of England. Also missing till May 12 would be the Bangladesh allrounder, Shakib Al Hasan, who is set to tour Zimbabwe.

One big reason Knight Riders finished second to the Delhi Daredevils on the points table at the end of the league phase last year was due to their skewed win-loss records home and away. Though they had a fantastic away record with just one defeat in eight matches, they lost four times in seven completed home matches.

So, do Knight Riders reinvent themselves or follow the same path that led them to their maiden crown last season? Finding stability and a balanced team, two main attributes of Super Kings, will be the key for Knight Riders.

Key players

: The main catalyst behind Knight Riders' triumph last season, Narine will be itching to bounce back after being dropped from the home Test series against Zimbabwe owing to an ineffective performance in the away series in Bangladesh. Narine, who bowled an important spell of 3.4-0-9-3 in the World Twenty20 final , could once again be the confounding spinner who proved to be the best bowler of the 2012 season.

L Balaji: Gambhir dedicated the final victory in 2012 to the India and Tamil Nadu seamer, who was forced to sit out the summit clash. Balaji had an economy rate of 5.40 (against T20I career ER of 7.98) as he used his knowledge of bowling on Indian pitches to good effect, cramping the opposition batsmen for width while teasing them with his variations.

Trevor Penney: Not one of the most athletic fielding sides in the IPL, the team management identified that a successful fielding coach, in Penney, who serves in the same role with the Indian team, was necessary.

Big players in

: He was an unknown as recently as two months ago when Knight Riders bought him for an eye-popping $625,000. The idea, the team management said, was to pair him with Narine as the second part of the 'mystery twins'. Senanayanke, a tall Sri Lanka offspinner, is known for his bag of tricks including a good arm ball to which he recently added a lethal doosra.

Big players out

: The young South African fast bowler suffered a stress fracture last June immediately after the IPL and was released by the franchise, who had bought him for $50,000 at the previous year's auction.

Below the radar

: Probably the costliest player on the bench in the history of IPL. Morgan entered the IPL for the first time in 2010 after the Royal Challengers Bangalore bought him for $220,000. Last year the Knight Riders paid $350,000 to buy the England batsman, known for his dynamic batting and match-turning knocks.

FOR TWO days now, Parvesh Kumar, a rescuer from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), has been trying to persuade Rina Begum, a resident of Tulsibari village in Assam’s Morigaon district, to leave her half-submerged house.

Over the last 48 hours, as rescuers shuttle her neighbours from their marooned homes to dry land, Begum, a 50-year-old grandmother of four, watched but remained defiant. “How can we leave our home?” she says, standing in waist-deep water.

Kumar says Begum’s family isn’t the only reluctant one. “There are many families who are refusing to leave their homes,” he says. “Yesterday, we went to a very remote area. There were 20 people stuck in one house, but only seven came back with us.” The team still gave the villagers their phone number, in case they changed their mind. Later at night, as the water rose, Kumar got a call. “When it gets worse, they change their mind usually,” he says.

In minority-dominated areas of Assam, home and land are tangible markers of identity in a state that is days away from the July 31 deadline for publication of the final National Register of Citizens (NRC). “This could be one of the reasons that they feel so scared to leave their homes,” says an official from the local administration.

According to Kumar, the families who agree to be rescued make sure that their documents are safe too. “So many times, we brought them to safety only to go back again because they realise they have forgotten their documents,” says Kumar.

For Begum, her daughter, and four grand-daughters, the youngest a six-month-old, the only safe space is their bed, supported by two sticks, and tied up at a higher level. On it, the infant sleeps, as floodwaters from an overflowing Brahmaputra swivel around. Their clothes have been washed away, upturned chairs float in the brown water, and at a distance, the tin-roof of their toilet is bare visible.

When the rains came on July 8, Begum did not pay much attention. This was regular. When the waters started rising, it still did not perturb her. This had happened the previous year, too.

But by Sunday afternoon, when two embankments in the Laharighat and Bhuragaon revenue circles were breached and the water rose above their waists, Begum and her daughter started stowing away their paddy on the roof. As did her sister-in-law and niece, in the house next door. Their husbands, daily wage workers, were in Dibrugarh.

Begum’s family is among the 52 lakh people who have been affected by the first wave of floods this monsoon. At least 30 out of 33 districts in Assam are reeling, with 1,47,304 people in 695 relief camps. About 95 per cent of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Kaziranga is under water. Many say it’s the worse deluge in more than a decade.

In Morigaon, more than 5 lakh people have been affected. In Laharighat revenue circle, where Begum’s home is, 1 lakh people have been affected, with the NDRF in action for the past five days.

Sofikul Islam, a 45-year-old farmer, lost not just the two bikes his family owned, but goats too. “Our house has gone under but that happened two years ago as well,” he says. “The flimsy embankments don’t help. All of them are made of sand and are not strong. What we need is better rehabilitation when the flood strikes.”

While rice, salt and dal have reached the village, residents claim it’s neither enough nor equally divided. At the revenue circle office, an official says, “Relief takes time to reach us. And even the villages which have not been affected come for food. It is hard to ensure that everyone gets their share.”

On Tuesday, the Centre announced Rs 251 crore in assistance to the State Disaster Response Fund, but Begum and her family haven’t eaten all day. Her husband reached earlier in the morning, and has gone to get Seera (flattened rice) for the family.

“Today is the first day in a week that it hasn’t rained,” says Begum. “Maybe, it will get better.”

Kumar says it will be a while before the water recedes. Till then, he will wait for Begum to change her mind and make that phone call.",2019-07-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['dont', 'floods', 'waters', 'tora', 'nrc', 'water', 'begum', 'deadline', 'stranded', 'morigaon', 'state', 'rescued', 'express', 'family', 'families', 'approaching', 'agarwala', 'assam', 'stay']",India,news article,English

You either think reality TV shows on Bravo are absolute trash or you believe the cast of “Real Housewives of Potomac” deserve all the Emmy Awards.

If you fall into the latter group, then you know just how different each “Housewives” franchise can be.

Sure, each show follows the same premise -- a group of wealthy women who run in the same social circles, arguing and throwing shade for our entertainment; but as the years have gone on, some franchises remain top tier, while others have fizzled out completely.

And while the Bravo network has other fantastic TV shows, such as the “Below Deck” franchise, “Summer House,” “Top Chef” and “Vanderpump Rules,” nothing can beat “The Real Housewives.”

Plus, the shows are now being filmed during the pandemic, so that’s added a whole other layer to the show.

Just a few weeks go, the flagship “Housewives” show, “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” turned 15 years old.

Ad

So, in honor of 15 years of back-stabbing, wine-throwing and iconic one-liners (”who gon’ check me, boo?”) let’s rank the “Housewives” from worst to best, based from their most current season.

‘Real Housewives of Orange County’

After watching the latest season of the original franchise, this show is most in need of a cast shake-up.

That partially could be because the show has been on the air for the past 15 years. The last original cast member of the show, Vicki Gunvalson, left last year, and the rest of the cast has only been around for the past few seasons, so it’s not as if the cast is stale. It’s more or less that they are just boring.

It’s hard to relate to Shannon Beador’s constant whining and anxiety, Braunwyn Windham-Burke is a borderline narcissist and it’s not fun to watch anti-masker Kelly Dodd disregard COVID-19 protocols in the middle of a pandemic.

Andy Cohen, an executive producer of “Housewives” and the host of Bravo’s late-night show, “Watch What Happens Live,” said there would be a cast shake-up for next season, so let’s hope the production cleans house and starts with something fresh.

Ad

‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’

If this list was made five years ago, the ladies of “Beverly Hills” would be in the top three, without a doubt.

But lately? Not so much.

“Beverly Hills” was known for having top-tier drama and laughs, but over the past few seasons, the women have become a little too self-aware. They’re more concerned about serving a high-fashion look, complete with flawless makeup and hair, than rolling up their sleeves and throwing a glass of wine in someone’s face.

Part of the problem can be traced to Erika Girardi.

Girardi ushered in the concept of having a “glam squad.” She started bringing a team of makeup artists, hair stylists and creative directors to plan out her outfits for cast vacations. Now, all of the women have a glam squad, and it’s starting to take away from the “real” part of the show that so many of us tune in for. It seems like the cast is too concerned with looking glamorous -- and they’re afraid to let their hair down and be their fun selves (who we know they can be).

Ad

The addition of actress Denise Richards was a step in the right direction, but the cast tried to paint Richards as a villain this past season, and fans didn’t go along with it. Richards left the show and it was kind of a bummer.

The upcoming season has some new faces, including cast member Kyle Richards’ sister Kathy Hilton (aka Paris Hilton’s mom), and given the drama Richards has had with her other sister, Kim, who used to be on the show, we could be in for a strong season.

The trailer for the new season does look really good, but fans said the same thing about last season’s trailer and were immediately disappointed.

‘Real Housewives of Dallas’

The ladies from Dallas never really took off in the way that Bravo had probably hoped, and that’s a shame since it is the perfect kind of city to have a “Housewives” franchise.

The show has had a few iconic moments (former castmate LeeAnne Locken’s “they’re just hands” monologue comes to mind), but this past season, which is almost done, hasn’t had any memorable examples, and the fights have come off as petty and mean.

Ad

There is hope, though.

New cast member Tiffany Moon has been a breath of fresh air. She’s an accomplished doctor, and her parents are Chinese immigrants. Watching her share her story of being a first-generation immigrant has been incredible to watch, and something we rarely see on “Housewives” since the casts are so often white.

If “Dallas” does a shake-up of the cast next season and keeps Moon and some of the other women, the show has potential to move up in the ranks.

‘Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’

When Bravo announced at the end of 2019 that there would be a new “Housewives” franchise set in Salt Lake City, the general consensus was a big fat yawn.

Mormons? Really?

But after the show premiered in late 2020, the fandom quickly learned just how wrong that was.

Surprisingly, there is only one practicing Mormon in the entire cast. Instead, we got two ex-Mormons who shared their struggle of leaving the church, a Jewish woman going through a separation from her husband, a Togan woman who switched from being Mormon to Islam and the First Lady of a Pentecostal Church who is married to her step-grandfather.

Ad

And no, that last part is not made up.

With such a diverse cast, the ladies of “Salt Lake City” fully delivered for fans, and probably gave Bravo the best premiere season of a “Housewives” franchise, ever. The only reason it’s not higher on the list is that the middle of the season slowed down a bit, but it certainly ended on a high note.

And thanks to recent news, season two could launch it to the top of the list. Jen Shah, arguably the cast member who most of the drama stirs around, was recently arrested and charged for wire fraud and running a fraudulent telemarketing scheme. Shah was allegedly filming the show the day she was arrested, and apparently, will continue to film while out on bond.

The news exploded in the Bravo fandom, so expect “Salt Lake City” to be ratings gold next season as fans want to see Shah’s legal troubles unfold.

Get the popcorn ready, folks.

‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’

For being around for so long, the “Atlanta” cast has consistently been good, which is hard to do when it’s been on the air for more than a decade.

Ad

The show obviously is not as good as it once was in the early seasons, but considering that the core cast of Kandi Buress, Porsha Williams, Kenya Moore and Cynthia Bailey is still interesting to watch? That says a lot.

The current season is almost over, and we’ve gotten some pretty hilarious moments, including an episode that will forever go down in “Housewives” history, featuring a bachelorette party and a male stripper named Bolo.

This season also gets bonus points for featuring the cast’s participation in the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer, especially with Williams, who was arrested for protesting the death of Breonna Taylor.

“Atlanta” is probably due for a cast shake-up pretty soon, but if anything, we’ve learned that it’s still fun watching these cast members who have been established on the show for so long.

‘Real Housewives of New Jersey’

The best part of the “New Jersey” cast is that it is a true family ensemble, resembling a real-life soap opera in the best way possible. That’s what made the first few seasons of the show so good -- is that the entire cast felt like family, and that was partially due to the fact that it’s true.

Ad

The seasons before and after Teresa Giudice went to prison were lagging, but the show has had the same six cast members for the past three seasons alone, something that is practically unheard of in “Housewives” casts.

The women love and fight each other like sisters (emphasis on the “fight” this season) and their husbands are equally close.

Depending on the franchise, the husbands are involved at times, but mostly just for the wives to chat with.

But on “Jersey,” the husbands are fully involved in the drama, especially Joe Gorga, the husband of cast member Melissa Gorga, and Giudice’s brother.

The drama this season has been next-level, and the only critique there has been is that Giudice may need to go soon. She’s been the main character since the show premiered -- and easily put the “Housewives” on the map with her infamous table flip in the first season.

However, her antics have gotten pretty old.

Ad

Regardless, “New Jersey” feels like the show that it used to be when it first premiered more than a decade ago.

‘Real Housewives of New York City’

When we talk about the different franchises being different styles of shows, the “New York City” series could be described as a comedy.

Make no mistake, there are certainly some epic fights on “New York City” that have gone down in “Housewives” history, but these New Yorkers are genuinely hilarious, whether they know it or not.

You’re got Sonja Morgan, probably the most sexually liberated Housewife of all the franchises, who is a gas to watch; the totally oblivious former-Countess-turned-Cabaret-star Luann de Lesseps; the willfully delusional yet still hilarious Ramona Singer, and Dorinda Medley, who is known for her zingy one-liners.

Newcomer Leah McSweeney was added to last year’s season, and she was a breath of fresh air too, giving these women of a certain age something to talk about.

Ad

Like the “Atlanta” cast, the “New York City” ladies have had the same core cast for years now, and the show has been reliably good, season over season. Fans were nervous when Bethenny Frankel, arguably the most famous “Housewife” of them all, left “New York” a few seasons back, but the show still remains top-tier.

Sadly, Medley won’t be back for the new season (she was let go, but could return later) when it premieres, but the show is adding its first-ever Black cast member, something that has been long overdue.

‘The Real Housewives of Potomac’

There is a new supreme in the Bravo world, and it’s the ladies of a small town outside of Washington D.C. called Potomac.

The “Potomac” franchise has only been around for five seasons, but it’s gone on to show that the idea of a “Housewives” franchise can still be fresh and entertaining, even after being around for more than a decade.

The key to “Potomac’s” success is having a reliable and relatable cast, epic drama and hilarious antics. Their latest season was truly one for the books, with most of the drama circling around a fight between cast members Monique Samuels and Candiace Bassett that turned physical.

Ad

“Housewives” arguments normally never turn physical, but this one did, and it opened up a larger conversation about how we treat others, how to deal with anger and it taught each of the cast members a lesson.

Fans often slept on the ladies of “Potomac” during their first few seasons, but when word got around that an epic fight was going to go down, many (including this writer) jumped on the bandwagon to see if the hype was real, and reader, it certainly was.

It will be interesting to see if the cast can keep the momentum going, especially since Samuels has said she won’t return for a new season, but given just how close this cast is, it won’t be surprising to see that they bring it again.",2021-04-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['city', 'season', 'real', 'franchise', 'ranking', 'drama', 'seasons', 'worst', 'franchises', 'cast', 'york', 'bravo', 'best', 'housewives']",Kenya,news article,English

1 million people are estimated to be affected in nine districts

300,000 people are estimated to be in need of food assistance in nine districts

62,764 people are targeted by WFP with food assistance in three districts

Highlights

 On 28 August, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) asked WFP to provide food assistance to flood-affected people in Sindh Province.

 As of 9 September evening, WFP had distributed food to 669 households in Karachi (out of the total 1,780 targeted in Karachi). Distributions to 7,876 households in rural districts will start on 11 September.

 NDMA has warned of potential new flooding across the country, which could further increase the number of people in immediate need of assistance.

WFP Funding Requirements

 US$ 410,320 are needed to replenish food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations for this emergency response.

Situation Update

 The Sindh Government announced a state of emergency on 25 August, with 20 districts declared calamity-affected.

 On 2 September, at the request of the Sindh PDMA, the Sindh UN Provincial Programme Team launched a rapid needs assessment in the nine hardest-hit districts (including four in Karachi and five rural districts). The results were endorsed by the PDMA on 7 September.

 One million people are affected according to Sindh PDMA estimates; 30 percent of whom are estimated to be in need of food assistance based on the findings of the rapid needs assessment.

 In Karachi, water has receded in most parts of the city. However, the informal settlements of Malir District, located in low-lying areas and without sewage infrastructure, remain flooded.

Only 4 percent of households interviewed in Karachi said they had already received food assistance. Most of these households depend on casual labour, and their coping capacities have already been exhausted by COVID-19.

 In the rural areas assessed, only 1 percent of households had received food assistance, and the vast majority reported their food stocks would run out in less than five days. Agricultural livelihoods have been severely affected, with 93 percent of crop lost, 66 percent of irrigation infrastructure reported to be damaged, and most households reporting significant livestock losses or distress sales.",2020-09-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['situation', 'food', 'response', 'pakistan', '2020', 'pdma', 'households', 'assistance', 'need', 'report', 'wfp', 'districts', 'rural', 'karachi', 'flood', 'sindh']",Pakistan,news article,English
95,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Syrian civil war forces first withdrawal from Arctic Global Seed Vault - Wired.co.uk,https://www.wired.co.uk/article/syrian-war-leads-to-doomsday-bank-withdrawal,"NordGen/Dag Terje Filip Endresen

Syria has been forced to make the first withdrawal from a global seed bank to replenish local supplies. An unlikely fallout of the civil war, the withdrawal will see 130 boxes of seeds first deposited into the vault by Syria returned to the Middle East.

The seed bank in Syrian city of Aleppo was a hub for growing seeds and distributing them across the region before the war. The facility is no longer producing seeds and, while it is still storing them, the International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) has requested the return of 130 of 325 boxes it had deposited in the global vault. The total supply of 325 boxes contained 116,000 samples.

ICARDA was forced to move its headquarters from Aleppo to Beirut in 2012 because of the conflict, which has forced over 11 million people from their homes and killed around 250,000.

The Global Seed Vault, created in 2008, is located 800 miles from the North Pole on the Norwegian island of Svalbard. It houses over 865,000 seed samples of 4,000 different at risk plant species from across the world. It preserves the genetic data of seeds that are also stored in banks across the world. These local deposits can be accessed readily, whereas Svalbard supplies should only be requested as a last solution in the event of natural or human disasters.

It was set up in the wake of a number of disasters that made the need for a secure facility urgent: ""War in Rwanda, Burundi, the Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan has destroyed seed collections -- and the Pavlos station in St Petersburg, Russia's biggest field collection, is threatened by property developers,"" Cary Fowler, then executive director at the Global Crop Diversity Trust told WIRED in 2010.

Buried within a mountain, the Svalbard facility is designed to withstand a bomb, typhoon, flood or even a powerful earthquake. Seeds in the vault can be kept alive for 100 years.

One of the samples deposited by the ICARDA was Lathyrus, which can survive severe droughts. ""It's a sweet pea,"" Fowler said. ""You will find it as an ornamental plant, but in Ethiopia, Somalia, India and Bangladesh it is a food crop. It's incredibly hardy, the most drought-proof crop in Ethiopia, and still lives when everything else dies. ""Two years ago I was with a farmer in Ethiopia and there were fissures on his land that you could put your arm in, up to the elbow, and this plant was still flowering. It is pest-resistant, survives floods and has the highest protein content of any food legume. A very important crop for poor people.""

The Svalbard bank is not a ""Doomsday"" plan. It was expected that technical issues would be the likely cause for withdrawals -- equipment failures or mismanagement in country banks around the world.",2015-09-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['seeds', 'war', 'bank', 'crop', 'civil', 'world', 'vault', 'svalbard', 'withdrawal', 'arctic', 'seed', 'global', 'plant', 'forced', 'forces', 'syrian']",Somalia,news article,English

By LEOPOLD OBI

More by this Author Summary Those who called the semi-permanent structures home would have loved to continue living there, but apocalyptic floods made their choice for them.

The floods which began in early 2020 displaced more than 200,000 people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania- the three East African countries.

Experts now warn that the flood is unlikely to be a one-off occurrence.

Buildings that once stood defiantly along Chuowe Beach in Homabay on the shores of Lake Victoria now seem set to surrender to the unlikely fate of never being inhabited again after spending months strapped under water.

Those who called the semi-permanent structures home would have loved to continue living there, but apocalyptic floods made their choice for them.

The floods which began in early 2020 displaced more than 200,000 people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania- the three East African countries relying on the continentâ??s largest fresh water lake. Lake Victoria Basin Commission says the water body rose to a new record level of 13.42 metre â?? marginally higher than the 13.41 metre mark recorded in 1964.

Before the floods, Willis Omulo, his family and scores of locals around his tiny village in Karachuonyo North were living quite a normal life. They tilled their farms and went fishing. Others also harvested sand, indiscriminately.

In 2018, while covering sand harvesting incidents that was turning the village into ruins, Omulo â?? an environmental activist at Aluora Makare CBO â?? happily took us around.

At the time he was living in a one bedroom house built of iron sheets, from the wall to the roof. The structure, he says, could resist flash floods common in the area during heavy rains.

Submerged farms

Last week we returned to the village to follow up on sand harvesting, and asked Omulo who has been advocating for tree planting in the village to take us to his tree farm.

The father of one pensively looked into the far distance before calling an old man to hand him a boat paddle. He then steered the canoe into the water after which we all jumped in to head to the farm.

â??The farm no longer exists anymore. It was submerged,â? he offered, â??I donâ??t have a home either and for the last 12 months my family is being hosted at a nearby dispensary.â?

As we silently paddled the wooden boat to what used to be his home, Omuloâ??s frustration as a young family man looked palpable even behind the dark glass he wore.

Alice Kiche, mother of eight, explained the night when floods came. Everyone was comfortably asleep and nothing out of the ordinary was anticipated. Then suddenly, the lake swelled before furiously tearing its ways into nearby homes and farms.

â??The flash floods were so fast and strong we only managed to rescue our children and a few belongings but everything else was lost,â? the widow said.

Her two-bedroom bricked house was marooned and destroyed by the floods.

â??We sought refuge in a classroom at a nearby school. But moved out when schools reopened,â? she explained, adding that all her plots were swallowed by the lake.

The villagers thought the floods would disappear in a week or two. But more than a year later Kiche, her children including three daughters-in-law remain without a permanent place to call home.

Experts now warn that the flood is unlikely to be a one-off occurrence.

The high water levels in the lake will be more frequent in the future due to heavy rainfalls, Dr Lydia Olaka, a geoscientist at the University of Nairobi warned â?? barely giving the region time to recover from one crisis, before another hits

Before the tragic floods, the beach was a lively spot, a fish landing bay and a convenient market for dealers like Kiche. Yet now it has been submerged by waist-high waters, sinking all the business in the process.

Hungry and homeless

Itâ??s not just those that rely on the lake for their livelihoods that have been affected. Like Kiche, Elijah Ngâ??ongâ??o, 54, has spent seven months living in his neighbourâ??s kitchen.

Towards the end of 2019 as farmers in prepared for planting during the October-December short rains, Ngâ??ongâ??o and his fellow villagers also prepared their farms. All went well until extreme rainfall came, flooded and swept the farms away, leaving them hungry and homeless.

â??We are living in very desperate conditions. Iâ??m a farmer who doesnâ??t like living at the mercy of others. But Iâ??ve become helpless after floods drowned all my harvest,â? he said.

Apart from the heavy rains, which are forcing a back flow of the lake, wanton sand harvesting is partly to blame with the rapid expansion of the lake.

With the top sandy soil heavily harvested, the layer left behind is close to the water table which easily recharges during heavy rains, adding to the deluge, the villagers observed.

Besides the floods, the village also do not have electricity.

â??Sand harvesters left electric poles standing dangerously, some have since collapsed, therefore Kenya Power disconnected the entire village,â? said William Amuom, a resident adding that some locals now use the power lines to hang their cloths.

Because of the swelling lake, wild animals such as hippos have not only moved to live closer to the people but are also terrorising them days on end.

The flood victims said the government promised them building materials, but over 12 months later they were still holding on.

Dr Olaka explained that the rains in the region were unusually heavy and due to the Indian Ocean Dipole â?? a weather phenomenon caused by differences in sea surface temperatures between the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean.

Apart from property destructions, there are concerns that floods have also increased the spread of pollution, and potential for disease.

Prof Richard Muga, health chief executive officer in Homabay, said the area was lucky to have escaped a public health crisis amid the floods and Covid-19 pandemic.

The lakeâ??s backwash flooded toilets, which posed a deadly risk to the communities who lack piped water. Prof Muga said the county had to spend millions of shillings distributing water treatment tablets to avert water borne diseases.

So far, the national government has provided little help beyond advising residents to move, said Omulo.

â??The government keeps telling us to move to higher grounds, yet they are not telling us where on the higher grounds they have reserved land for us,â? he said.",2021-02-10 08:00:00+00:00,"['victoria', 'lake', 'heavy', 'livelihoods', 'gone', 'sand', 'rising', 'kiche', 'water', 'upends', 'months', 'village', 'rains', 'floods', 'living']",Kenya,news article,English

1881,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Millions at risk as melting Pakistan glaciers raise flood fears - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/6/9/millions-at-risk-as-melting-pakistan-glaciers-raise-flood-fears,"As ice melts, there is risk of large glacial lakes bursting through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream.

Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistans mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet (three metres) from my familys home. We evacuated, said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

The floodwater broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village, Qadir told the Reuters news agency by telephone.

Now there is a ravine right next to our houses, and we live in dread of another flood.

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37m in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners  the UN Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change  as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters, he told Reuters.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with the aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistans assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now up and running.

Melting glaciers

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the UN Adaptation Fund from 2011 to 2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

People will suffer

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that June to September will be dangerous, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier in a helicopter recently, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistans Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier, and there was talk of an [automated] early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken, he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system is extremely urgent, as summer heat raises the threat level.

We dont care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system, Qadir said.

This coming summer there will be more flooding, and people will suffer.",2020-06-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['warning', 'millions', 'ice', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'fears', 'hassanabad', 'walls', 'raise', 'glaciers', 'outburst', 'flood', 'shishper', 'melting', 'systems', 'risk']",Pakistan,news article,English
1113,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Alexandria: locals adapt to floods as coastal waters inch closer - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/alexandria-egypt-locals-adapt-storms-floods-coastal-waters-rise,"“Before we were flooded a couple of years ago, we didn’t imagine the water could reach this level,” said cafe manager Samir Gaber, gesturing at a cluster of tables overlooking the Mediterranean.

Gaber has managed the Latino cafe in Alexandria for six years, during which time the business has had to adapt to increasingly dramatic winter storms. With the storms come the floods, crashing waves engulfing large chunks of the many cafes nestled on the coastline.

“There was another wall here before the flooding, but the steel bars [supporting it] were destroyed,” explained Gaber. “Now we’ve constructed a drain to absorb floodwater,” he said, gesturing below the new stone wall running along the outside edge of the cafe.

Many of the cafes and businesses on the Alexandria coast have begun adjusting to extreme weather without making the link to climate change.

On the southern tip of the Mediterranean, the coastal waters are inching closer to buildings and flooded ancient structures, including the Greco-Roman tombs at Anfushi. Seawater seeping into the groundwater has also made the fragile ground more unstable, resulting in the alarming collapse of some of the city’s buildings.

The UN estimates that global sea levels will rise between 13cm and 68cm by 2050, and say that the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable – by 2080, up to 120,000 people living near the sea could be affected by rising waters if no action is taken to protect them.

Rising sea levels and seawater temperatures will also increase the salinity of the Nile, Egypt’s primary water source, and increasingly salty water sources could destroy farmland across the Nile Delta. In 2007, the World Bank estimated that 10.5% of Egypt’s population could be displaced by rising waters caused by climate change.

An hour to the east from Alexandria, the quiet of the town of Rosetta ignores the urgency of the lapping waters. Life in the town, famed for the discovery of the Rosetta stone, is at one with the sea.

“You have to do what you have to do, and don’t think about the bad weather – the good weather comes from God,” said fisherman Ahmed Mohamed Gowayed, reciting a local saying.

Storms annually disrupt the calm of this low-lying town where houses sit at sea level, many only separated from the coast by a winding coast road. But in recent years the weather has been more violent.

“Last year the storm destroyed palm trees, buildings, cars – older people in their seventies said they’d never seen anything like it in their lives,” said Gowayed. The storm also destroyed barges and kiosks that local fishermen rely on for their livelihoods. “If the weather continues like this I will build a stronger kiosk,” smiled Gowayed, undeterred by the prospect of the next storm.

Mohamed El Raey, professor of environmental studies at Alexandria University, believes that climate change is contributing to an increase in “extreme events”, across Egypt. “The government needs to increase awareness among the population,” he said.

They also need to be more stringent about urban planning, he added. “If people don’t find places to live that they like, they build houses wherever they find an area.”

In 2011, the government released a report detailing how the country must adapt to climate change, estimating that about 13% of Egypt’s northern coastline was at risk.

Political and economic upheavals have since diverted their attention elsewhere, but in Alexandria and Rosetta the impact of climate change is becoming increasingly hard to ignore.",2017-01-19 08:00:00+00:00,"['floods', 'sea', 'inch', 'water', 'alexandria', 'locals', 'rising', 'waters', 'weather', 'rosetta', 'closer', 'climate', 'coastal', 'egypts', 'town', 'adapt']",Egypt,news article,English

The chance of such events could increase five to 10 times by 2050, resulting in economic and infrastructural damage that could cost billions of dollars, according to a McKinsey report, dated April. The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.

Ho Chi Minh City, a historic flood area located some 1,000 miles south of the capital Hanoi, contributes about a quarter of the Vietnams gross domestic product. While the metropolis can cope with flood risks today that could hit 23% of its area, further urbanization is raising the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels. Those could cause about $8.4 billion of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact, McKinsey said.

The city still has time to adapt to avoid such risks by having better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas, McKinsey said. Investments and fund-raising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.

Normal November weather in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, is pleasant and warm with a chance of epic thunderstorms. The sun will be shining in the morning, and then boom the sky opens up and a stiff wind begins to blow and it's probably best if you're inside.

At 10 a.m. on an 85-degree Thursday this November, Mozambique's lead weather forecaster, Acacio Tembe, was stooped at a computer at the National Institute of Meteorology, trying to figure out whether a storm was in the cards that afternoon. He toggled between tabs with global weather maps put out by the U.S. Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan. On every map, clouds and bands of rain moved in a lazy loop across Mozambique and neighboring South Africa.

Tembe's phone rang. The man on the other end was in charge of drainage and water resources for the city of Maputo, and he wanted to know: Is there going to be a storm? Because just an inch and a half of rain can cause flooding in city streets.

""We don't know,"" Tembe told him. ""We are still analyzing the information.""

Tembe promised to let him know if they decided to issue a weather warning and then hung up and leaned forward in his swivel office chair. He stared silently at the clouds moving across his screen, as if putting his face closer to the monitor might somehow give him what he really needed: a map with better resolution.

The forecast for forecasting: cloudy

toggle caption Nichole Sobecki/VII for NPR

Mozambique is one of many countries around the world where weather forecasting is lagging behind even as climate change drives more extreme and variable weather. In Bangladesh, tropical storm warnings are not adequately reliable. In Peru, the national government is trying to get weather and climate information to residents who are experiencing more extreme weather. The World Meteorological Organization is working on upgrading flash flood warning systems in more than 50 countries around the world, including Mozambique.

Mozambique's meteorologists currently rely heavily on weather data and models collected and created by, and primary tailored to, the needs of other countries.

""Right now, we're using global models,"" Tembe explains. They're helpful for understanding the large-scale weather forecast for the country — for example, figuring out if it's going to rain later in the week or if a cyclone is brewing off the coast.

But Tembe says the information from these models isn't specific enough to consistently predict local and short-term weather. That is an increasingly serious problem, because weather in Mozambique is getting more extreme.

""Nowadays, we have more intense phenomena,"" he explains. ""More cases of strong rains, the heat is stronger, the winds are stronger. It's different from the past."" Mozambique is already suffering longer droughts and more frequent and severe storms than it was earlier this century, because the climate is changing.

Dangerous fallout

That extreme weather can be deadly. Much of the country is currently suffering from a drought that is straining food supplies. And this spring two powerful cyclones hit Mozambique in quick succession, killing hundreds of people and destroying thousands of buildings. The first, Cyclone Idai, hit near Mozambique's third largest city, Beira, ripping apart homes and flooding much of the city.

""The exposure of disaster risk for Mozambique will increase as a consequence of climate change,"" says Antonio Queface, an atmospheric scientist in the physics department of Maputo's Eduardo Mondlane University. ""[If] we look specifically for the tropical cyclones, from 1979 up to recent years, even including Idai in 2019, you can see there's a change in patterns. The cyclones become more severe, with strong winds and rain, and more frequent.""

Everyday weather is also becoming more extreme and harder to predict. As is true in much of the world as the Earth gets hotter, climate change is also making extreme rain more likely. That means that a larger share of the precipitation that falls on the country is forecast to come in big dumps as opposed to more moderate rainstorms.

It all adds up to more and more risk for people across Mozambique. In coastal communities on the country's long Indian Ocean coast, sea level rise and more intense tropical storms are making life both more dangerous and uncertain. For the more than 3 million families that farm in Mozambique, longer dry stretches can mean fewer crops and dead livestock.

In order to adapt, residents need more accurate information, both about the local weather on any given day and about how weather patterns are changing. Both will require better weather and climate forecasting capability.

What's missing

toggle caption Nichole Sobecki/VII for NPR

Queface says there are two missing pieces right now: weather forecasting models with higher resolution, so meteorologists can zoom in and give residents more specific information, and more weather data to make those models accurate.

Over the last two decades, the international weather maps available to Mozambique through the United Nations World Meteorological Organization, the European Union and national governments including the United States have all become more detailed, as weather satellite technology has advanced. But not all of that data is available to forecasters in other countries in real time, in part because many countries do not have the computing power or the Internet speeds necessary to get and use the data for short-turnaround forecasts.

""I think it's a challenging issue on the models,"" Queface says. ""How do you give inputs to the model? What data do you have? Africa as a continent, maybe excluding South Africa, there's a scarcity of meteorological data"" available for local and national weather forecasting.

It's not just satellite data. Mozambique has just a handful of weather stations taking measurements across the country, according to the National Institute of Meteorology.

Without accurate, continuous, local information about wind, humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation and other basic weather measurements, a higher-resolution, Mozambique-specific weather model would still be inaccurate, Queface says. ""[It's] garbage in, garbage out on the model. So the model itself doesn't solve anything.""

Radar enters the picture

In the early 2000s, Mozambique's government partnered with the World Bank to install two weather radar stations. The goal was to collect the kind of data meteorologists need to make accurate forecasts and also to help scientists track changes in the country's climate.

One radar installation was in the coastal city of Beira, and the second was a few hours north of the capital, in the city of Xai-Xai. When the Xai-Xai location opened in 2004, then-President Joaquim Chissano attended the so-called baptizing of the installation and gave it a name: ""Life Radar.""

""It was something that made the people here very proud,"" says Salamao Mausse, the longtime janitor for the local meteorology office in charge of the radar. ""That the radar was providing good, accurate weather information to the whole country.""

toggle caption Nichole Sobecki/VII for NPR

The radar also changed how local residents thought about weather forecasts, he says. In the past, many people hadn't put a lot of stock in local forecasts because they were often wrong. But in 2008, when the radar had been up and running for a few years, there was a storm in the region. The local meteorologists could see from the radar data that the storm was parked over the neighboring province. They put out a forecast warning people there that flooding was likely for the next two days, so they should make sure their cattle were safe and avoid low-lying places.

Indeed, the storm did exactly as they predicted.

""And everyone was really impressed,"" Mausse remembers and laughs. ""They were, like, 'Are you talking to God with that thing?' ""

But shortly after that, according to the National Institute of Meteorology, the radar started to malfunction. It was difficult to keep calibrated and hard to fix because the company that made it, Gematronik, was in Germany. And local technicians in Mozambique didn't have experience with radar.

The radar in Xai-Xai stopped providing data in 2013. Mausse has continued to walk up the hill every few days to clean and dust the radar control rooms, and cut the grass around the outside, with the hope that it will someday be fixed. Mozambique's second radar installation has also stopped working, Tembe says.

At the 2015 American Meteorological Society meeting, researchers presented a study from neighboring South Africa that found that 16 radar systems made by the same company were ""plagued by technical problems."" The study noted that both Mozambique and Botswana have had similar problems. The authors suggest that older radar systems might be more useful in the region in the long run, since they would be easier to maintain with local parts and expertise. Another option could be decentralized data collected by weather sensors in vehicles and mobile phones.

Queface points out that, no matter where weather data comes from, Mozambique will need faster, more reliable Internet, more advanced computing and more training for its meteorologists.

In search of money

Many countries hope funding for such upgrades will come out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which is being discussed by leaders from around the world this week in Madrid. Under the agreement, major industrialized countries that have contributed the most to total global greenhouse gas emissions agreed to pay into a global fund that would help cover the costs of managing and adapting to climate change.

Just last week, the fund gave $10 million to the Philippines for upgrading its weather forecasting in some parts of the country.

But the amount of money available for such upgrades lags far behind the amount of money promised. The United States has contributed about a third of the $3 billion that it pledged in 2014 under the Obama administration.

Queface says outside money is crucial if Mozambique wants to build a better weather forecasting system. ""Countries like ours, they have a lot of priorities,"" he says. ""You need schools, you need health centers, you need so many things. And sometimes, a disaster comes and you need relief operations.""",2019-12-11 08:00:00+00:00,"['local', 'mozambique', 'change', 'sobeckivii', 'climate', 'world', 'meteorologists', 'weather', 'data', 'radar', 'cant', 'nichole', 'caption']",Mozambique,news article,English

KOCHI: With the water receding from flood-affected regions and houses, cleaning drive has started in many places. Volunteers from the area committees of different parties and corporation are helping the people in carrying out cleaning and restoration of homes.

“From 11 am, we cleaned around 15 houses. We spotted three snakes in different houses while cleaning. The locals also help us in cleaning activities. It is a collective effort,” said Ashraf, a volunteer who is part of the cleaning initiatives at Chirakkuzhy.

Meanwhile, Deepa Dharmajan, who was bitten by a snake the other day, is recovering at Little Flower Hospital, Angamaly. “Deepa was rushed to the hospital soon after she was bitten by the snake, which crawled up inside their home,” said Yusuf K K, a resident of Chirakkuzhy.

No end to the grievances

The people of Chirakkuzhy ward no. 9 are cut up with the decision of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) to set up a transformer in the vicinity of a pond there.

According to them, the location of the transformer leads to power being switched off whenever the water level in the pond goes up alarmingly. “The KSEB officials switch off the power when the water level in the pond rises, giving us a hard time as we struggle to keep our belongings safe at night,” said Sreedharan, a Chirakkuzhy resident.

Adding to the woes of the residents, there was has been no power in the area for the last two days. The 11 KV lines passing through the compound of houses are also causing difficulties for the people.

But the destruction of Hurricane Eta in early November left him in debt and unable to feed his three children.

So he set out with three neighbors to try to cross Guatemala, then Mexico and eventually find work in the United States.

“First the pandemic, and then the hurricane … we have no money for our children,” he said on the journey north.

Back-to-back hurricanes Eta and Iota internally displaced more than half a million people in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, according to International Organization for Migration data. The UN agency said at least a third could be displaced for more than three months, hampering their ability to earn a living and rebuild their lives.

“Every day, about 20 new people arrive because they lost their land, their homes, and their crops in Honduras and Guatemala,” said Gabriel Romero, the director of a migrant shelter in the southern Mexican city of Tenosique.

Thousands more Central Americans say they’re planning to join northbound caravans with names like “Caravan for Flood victims” scheduled to begin departing from Honduras in the coming weeks, according to conversations in Facebook and WhatsApp groups dedicated to coordinating the efforts.

Such a mass movement could become a major test for the incoming administration of US president-elect Joe Biden as it tries to undo some of President Donald Trump’s most severe anti-immigration measures without turning pent up pressure into a border crisis.

On the election campaign trail, Biden promised a US$4 billion plan to address underlying factors driving migration from Central America. Advocacy group Refugees International says such relief, while welcome, will take years to have an impact.

In the first installment, we looked at how advances in robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, computing, and autonomous systems could shape warfare. In our second installment, we will look at how technological, political, social, and environmental change could shape the future economy.

Much like the size and shape of future battlefields, the evolution of trade, commerce, and global marketplaces is rather difficult to predict. After all, wherever human beings are involved (and in large numbers), chaos is sure to ensue! Still, there are a few significant changes on the way that cannot be denied, and which economists are preparing for. They include, in no particular order:

Population growth (predominantly in urban centers)

Growth of non-western economies and markets

New technologies, industries, and professions

Changing temperatures, weather patterns, and water shortages

Renewable energy and sustainability

The bottom line is that the future economies will simultaneously be driven by abundance and scarcity, where more people will need to be sustained using less in the way of resources. This challenge not only has the potential for a lot of uncertainty and chaos, but it will also likely foster the development of solutions.

Growing Populations

According to a 2019 report compiled by the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs  titled ""World Population Prospects 2019""  the global population is expected to reach 9.74 billion by mid-century. However, the addition of more than 2 billion people will not be equally distributed between the world's nations.

Whereas Asia has been the greatest contributor to the global population since the mid-20th century, population growth there has been slowing since the beginning of the 21st century. By 2030, Asia's population growth is expected to plateau, and the population of the continent is expected to stay in the vicinity of 5 billion people until 2050.

From that point onward, the only continent to experience a significant increase in population growth will be Africa. Currently, Africa has a population of 1.36 billion people and is projected to reach up to 2.5 billion by mid-century (that's an increase of about 83%). Nevertheless, by 2050, Asia will still be the most populous continent, with a total population of about 5.29 billion.

Africa will be the second-most populous, with an estimated population of 2.49 billion. Latin America and the Caribbean will be third with an estimated 710 million, followed by Europe (705 million), North America (430 million), and Oceania (60 million). As always, the factors driving this growth will be economic, social, and technological in nature.

Urban Sprawl

Another important aspect of population growth in this century is where it will be concentrated. Today, roughly 56% of the global population lives in urban centers instead of rural settings, which works out to about 4.4 billion people. By 2050, the global urban population is projected to increase to 6.6 billion, or roughly 68% of humanity.

This will place additional stress on environmental systems that are already under severe stress by major cities. Urban expansion means that more land needs to be cleared to build infrastructure, more water needs to be diverted for utilities, more electricity needs to be generated, and more agricultural land needs to be set aside.

Since urban populations will be growing far beyond their rural counterparts, there will be proportionally fewer farmers in addition to less farmland. Coupled with the effects of climate change (see below), this means there will be many more mouths to feed in 2050. At the same time, the resources we'll need to do so will be in shorter supply.

However, the problem goes beyond food production. While every new child born between now and 2050 will be another mouth to feed, they'll also be another person in need of shelter, utilities, sanitation, medical care, education, and eventual employment. When these needs are not met, the end result is generally an increase in violent crime, terrorism, and humanitarian crises.

Luckily, it's not all doom and gloom. For, as the logic goes, every new life is a mouth to feed, but also a pair of working hands and a brain for problem-solving. The same holds true for urban environments, which are a big draw on natural resources but also centers for innovation and creative pursuits.

The (Shifting) Wealth of Nations

The global economic balance is expected to change significantly between now and 2050. While much of this is well underway, the pace of change is predicted to accelerate in the next three decades. According to a 2020 Bloomberg Economics forecast, the post-WWII economic stability enjoyed by the developed nations of the world will be coming to an end as new superpowers take their place on the world stage.

In short, the global economy will experience a shift in its center of gravity, moving from West to East and from advanced economies to emerging markets. The effect this will have on global politics, which is similarly already being felt, will intensify. For starters, China will have overtaken the US in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035 and become the world's largest economy.

By 2050, Asia's share of the global market share of GDP will grow to over 50% (driven largely by China and India). North American and Europe will account for about 20% each, while the rest of the world will account for less than 10%. In terms of which nations will be the wealthiest, the top ten today are the US, China, Japan, Germany, France, India, the U.K., Brazil, Italy, and Canada.

By 2050, this is forecast to be China, the US, India, Indonesia, Germany, Japan, Brazil, France, the U.K., and Turkey. For the first time since the ""Age of Imperialism,"" the richest nations in the world will not all be in Europe and North America. Instead, wealth and the political influence it brings will be more evenly distributed between the continents.

Beyond the top ten spots, the largest economies will also be located outside of Europe and North America. They include Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Nigeria, Mexico, Poland, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand.

But it's not all about who has the most wealth. There's also the question of which will be the fastest-growing economies. In this respect, the countries experiencing the most significant growth in terms of GDP and per capita income by 2050 will be Nigeria, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Egypt, Malaysia, Columbia, Mexico, and Thailand.

Once again, the markets of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be the greatest drivers of change. Much of this will be the result of digital technology and the access it ensures becoming more widespread, to the point where every nation and person in the world can get online.

Internet of Everything

According to a 2018 report by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), more than half of the global population now has access to the internet. By 2050, 90% of the world's people are expected to have access, owing to a combination of economic growth in the developed world, the proliferation of mobile devices, and access to broadband satellite services.

In addition to people, an exponentially greater amount of mobile devices, sensors, ""smart-home"" appliances, and gadgets will be connected to the internet by the middle of the century. In fact, individual devices may also be ""smartened"" thanks to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms, predictive algorithms, and other forms of neural-net software.

Speaking of technology that imitates how humans process information and learn, ongoing studies into human neurology could well lead to the widespread adoption of neural implants. With devices like Neuralink, people will be able to interface with computers and devices, access the internet, do online banking, blog, surf, and create content through the simple act of thinking!

These developments would further accelerate the transition from a physical to a digital economy, where growth is data-driven and the most valuable resource is content. It will also give rise to the so-called ""Internet of Things"" (IoT)  where the real world will come to resemble the internet. This will have a profound effect on society, by improving efficiency and anticipating behavior in advance.

Concordantly, information security will become far more important, as privacy becomes a thing of the past. With cameras, sensors, and digital markers everywhere, and increasingly sophisticated AI systems mining the data to anticipate patterns and spending habits, every move a person makes will be recorded and cataloged in the cloud.

If outside parties were able to gain access to this data, it could lead to new levels of identity theft, extortion, and online harassment in the near future.

New Industries & New Jobs

Perhaps most significant of all is the way that accelerating technological trends will alter the way people work, communicate, shop, and consume. This will naturally lead to all kinds of new occupations, new opportunities for investment, and a general overhaul in how people ""do business."" Four major trends will coincide to drive this change, among them:

Technological Unemployment: Automation will continue to advance and lead to a vast increase in efficiency, but at the cost of eliminating a number of jobs. This will take not only the form of robotic systems but also machine learning and software that will remove the need for human analysis and oversight.

Increasingly Flexible Work: With automated systems handling more and more in the way of physical production, job growth will be increasingly focused on the creation of content and intellectual property. Combined with wireless technology, far more people will be able to work from home or remote locations and make their own hours.

Options for the Rich and Poor: In the developing world, much industrial work will be eliminated by the introduction of robotics and automated production. This will speed a new trend, where emerging nations and markets are forced to adapt to the high-tech, data-driven economy of the future, and the problems of ""downsizing"" and redundancy shift to the developing world.

Cryptocurrency and Blockchains: The rise of the ""industrial internet"" will create new redundancies but also opportunities for entrepreneurs. As more and more economic activity takes place online, economic activity will be far more direct, peer-to-peer, and decentralized.

This trend towards decentralization will be facilitated by the use of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the blockchains used to distribute them. These are poised to replace traditional banking and monetary transactions, but they may also be programmed to represent energy, resources, investment, and ownership.

Commercial Space: By 2050, the commercial space industry is expected to grow exponentially and reach the point where it is valued in the trillions. This will be driven by the deployment of ""megaconstellations"" providing telecom and internet services, miniature satellites enabling research and development, and orbital refueling services.

Space will become more and more accessible as launch costs continue to decline, owing to space planes, reusable rockets, and commercial spaceports. By mid-century, this could result in space tourism, space hotels, and even habitats in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Commercial missions to the Moon, lunar tourism, and even asteroid mining are also likely to become a reality.

The ability to prospect and mine Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) will lead to a massive influx of precious metals and building materials to the global economy. This is anticipated to lead to the world's first trillionaires, the devaluation of precious metals (which will no longer be scarce), and the creation of a space-construction industry.

A Warming Planet

For decades, scientists have known that Earth has been getting warmer since the late 19th century. This trend is the direct result of humanity's impact on the natural environment and fossil fuel consumption. This has led to increased levels of greenhouse gases  most notably, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which increase the amount of solar radiation our atmosphere absorbs.

According to the 2018 Special Report that was released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures are forecast to increase by an average of 2.7 F to 3.6 F (1.5 C to 2 C) by 2052. The 2.7 F (1.5 C) threshold is the target goal established by the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to mitigate climate change through the reduction of CO 2 emissions.

While this may not sound like a lot, it is important to remember that this is an average increase  which includes annual and regional variations. An increase of 2.7 F (1.5 C) to 3.6 F (2 C) will mean hotter summers, more precipitation, more instances of extreme weather, and the disruption of natural systems that humans rely on for their survival and livelihood.

These temperature increases will be felt strongly in Central and Eastern North America, Central and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Western and Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In regions located nearer to the poles (Canada, Russia, South Africa, and South America), the length of the frost-free season will likely increase, as will the corresponding growing season.

Because of this, countries located closer to the poles will experience a boom in agricultural production. At the same time, countries that have the largest supplies of renewable freshwater (Brazil, Russia, and Canada) will be forced to contend with increasing demand and may face serious repercussions if they do not scale up extraction to meet it.

Closer to the equator, temperature increases will mean more precipitation in the winter, which will mean more flooding, coastal storms, and runoff. During the summer, the increased heat will mean more drought, desertification, and the lowering of water tables. The combination of these extremes will also mean more in the way of erosion, runoff, and depletion of topsoil.

Similarly, heavily-populated areas along the coasts and major rivers that empty into oceans will be subject to rising sea levels. According to recent research, an estimated 4.6 billion mi (7.4 billion km) of land will flood or be underwater by 2040. This will have a massive economic impact as major urban centers are forced to contend with floods that become worse with every passing year.

By mid-century, several major cities are projected to be abandoned (or significantly depopulated) due to rising tides, flooding river systems, or sinkholes (caused by groundwater extraction). This will not only trigger migrations and refugee crises but will have a major impact on global markets as financial centers are lost.

Another trend, which is already well underway, will be the loss of glaciers and polar ice caps. According to a study released in April of 2020, simulations conducted by the Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP) have shown that the Arctic Circle will experience ice-free summers by 2050.

The loss of Arctic sea ice will have a profound impact on the planet, influencing ocean circulation and causing open water to absorb more heat. This, in turn, will lead to an increase in ocean temperatures, as well as the potential release of methane deposits beneath the Arctic Ocean.

A similar situation is happening in Siberia right now, where the disappearance of permafrost is allowing caches of subsurface methane to be released into the atmosphere. This creates a vicious circle, where the warming trend results in feedback mechanisms that cause even more warming, and so on.

Water Wars!

In many parts of the world, rapid industrialization and population growth have led to water shortages. In China, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan, Mexico, and the United States, this has led to desperate measures, and even international incidents. With the added stress caused by climate change, freshwater is projected to become increasingly scarce by 2050.

This will inevitably lead to ""Water Wars"" in parts of the world as neighboring countries fight to control access to limited supplies of freshwater  especially where international river systems are concerned. These rivers are essential for drinking water, irrigation, and sanitation wherever they flow, so neighboring countries are not likely to be in the mood to share when they begin to dry up.

In recent years, ""water futures"" have emerged and are now being traded like all precious commodities  similar to oil, precious metals, and stones. So, in addition to having a significant geopolitical and environmental impact, the disappearance of freshwater sources will also be played out in financial markets.

In the meantime, the scarcity of fresh water will continue to drive investment in desalination technology, water reclamation, and closed-loop environmental systems. This will be especially apparent in how architecture will incorporate ecology (aka. ""arcology"") in order to ensure greater sustainability in urban space.

Greener Energy

On the plus side, the impact of climate change will also lead to positive developments in the manufacturing, energy, and transportation sectors by 2050. For starters, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other ""green technologies"" will be far more common due to declining costs, competitive pricing, and the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2018, 28% of global electricity was generated from renewable energy sources  a combination of hydroelectric (45%), nuclear (28%), wind (13%), solar (6%), biofuels (5%), and other methods (3%). By 2050, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates that renewables will generate 49% of global electricity, followed by natural gas (23%), coal (23%), and nuclear (5%).

Solar will occupy the most significant share of renewable sources, accounting for 38% of all electrical generation, while wind will grow to 34%, hydro will reach 27%, and biomass and other fuels will account for the remainder. For solar and wind power, the greatest contributions are expected to be from China and India.

By mid-century, China will account for 37% of solar and 35% of wind generation worldwide, while India will account for 24% of solar and 22% of wind. Hydroelectric power use will be more evenly distributed, with China (23%), the EU (17%), Brazil (15%), and India (8%) occupying the largest share.

Renewable energy is already having a significant impact in developing nations, where access to centralized grids is limited, and utilities are considered unreliable. In these places, portable solar lights, portable wind turbines, and appliances that use alternative energy sources are providing sustainable energy for small communities.

Due to the ongoing loss of arable land, cities will also become greener as urban farming, vertical farming, aquaculture, hydroponics, community gardens, and buildings that combine architecture and ecology into a single design (arcology).

Other changes will include electronic vehicles (EVs), which will make up over half of the automobile market by 2050. Advances in Tokamak fusion reactors are also expected to lay the groundwork for fusion energy, which is projected to become commercially available by 2050 and after.



The economy of 2050 won't be anything most people would recognize today. Physical cash and in-person banking are already giving way to e-banking and e-commerce. By 2050, it will give way to cryptocurrencies and distribution nodes that are not subject to regulation or controlled by any centralized government or financial institution.

Between advancements in technology, more people, more connectivity, and the need to do more with less, it's hard to know how it will all play out. On the one hand, the world may find itself being dragged deeper into ecological damage and resource shortfalls, triggering all manner of crises and struggles.

On the other, it's possible that renewable energy, reduced emissions, smart living, commercial space, and a growing focus on sustainability, humanity will enter a period of ""post-scarcity"" economics. One thing is for sure, though. What we do between now and 2050 will determine what happens beyond that point. We could be headed for disaster, or destined for something better.",2021-05-03 07:00:00+00:00,"['increase', 'life', 'billion', 'growth', 'global', 'economy', 'change', 'water', 'glimpse', 'population', 'energy', '2050', 'world', 'future']",Pakistan,news article,English

Red Cross holds grave fears that deadly floods, which have submerged the countrys central provinces over recent days, will worsen as tropical storm Nangka makes landfall today, bringing destructive winds and dumping more rain on hard hit communities.

Since the floods began in early October, at least 28 people have been killed, more than 200,000 homes flooded and an estimated 84,000 hectares of crops damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people  many cut off by the floodwater  are now in desperate need of emergency relief.

As part of a coordinated relief effort, Viet Nam Red Cross staff and volunteers have been accessing isolated communities by boat to provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and other much needed supplies. More relief supplies are urgently being brought in from other parts of the country.

Mr Hoa Nguyen, Deputy Director of External Relations and Development, Viet Nam Red Cross, said: Our volunteers and staff have been working in the affected areas since the floods began, providing relief supplies to thousands of people, but we need to reach many more as the rain continues and floods worsen. Every day we hear of more families who have lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods.

Hung Ha Nguyen, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Programme Coordinator said: These floods are a double whammy making it even tougher for millions of people already grappling with the economic fall-out of COVID-19 that has destroyed incomes and livelihoods.

Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities, especially on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need to help ensure families receive the relief they need in the coming days and weeks, Mr Hung Ha said.

WIDESPREAD: Floods killed an additional two people in the province of West Nusa Tenggara, while overflowing dams engulfed nearly 10,000 residences

AFP, JAKARTA





At least 44 people were killed after flash floods and landslides swept an island in Indonesia’s easternmost province yesterday morning, rescue officials said, adding that they expected the toll to rise.

“There are 44 people dead, with nine injured” in East Flores Regency and “many ... are still under the mud,” Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati told reporters.

Hours before people woke to celebrate Easter Sunday, torrential rain unleashed flash floods in the Catholic-majority Flores Island.

Mud inundated homes, while bridges and roads in the eastern end of the island were destroyed.

Rescuers were struggling to reach the remote and worst-hit area in East Flores because of rains and strong waves.

The death toll rose from 23 earlier announced by authorities.

The number of injured is also expected to increase as the agency is still receiving reports from locals, Jati said.

“We are still documenting the total number of people injured,” the spokesperson said, adding that extreme weather is expected to continue in the coming week.

Separately yesterday, major floods also killed two people in Bima city in the neighboring province of West Nusa Tenggara, the disaster agency said.

Dams in four subdistricts also overflowed, submerging nearly 10,000 houses in Bima following a nine-hour downpour, Jati said.

Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Indonesian archipelago during the rainy season.

In January, flash floods hit the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people.

In September last year, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo, while a few months earlier dozens died in a similar disaster in Sulawesi.

Deforestation is often a cause of the landslides, environmentalists have said.

106,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Beware the Green Revolution - African Arguments,https://africanarguments.org/2015/10/beware-the-green-revolution/,"Many government and agencies see India’s 1960s Green Revolution as a great success that Africa should emulate. The soaring suicide rate amongst India’s farmers tells a different story.

The development community has been crowing of late about the obvious need to revamp African agricultural practices. Not since colonial times has it been so easy to blame small peasant farmers for the continent’s development woes. The standard agricultural development formula to address this, developed in other world regions, is to adopt new technologies and commercialise the farming sector. But African leaders ought to look twice before blindly encouraging their farmers to adopt this capital intensive approach.

The results have been nothing less than deadly in central India.

After four consecutive years of low rainfall, the Marathwada region of Maharashtra State has emerged as India’s farmer suicide capital. Located in central India, this region is about the size of Sierra Leone and has a population similar to that of Mali or Burkina Faso. Not unlike the savannah regions of West Africa, farmers in this relatively poor area used to mainly grow drought tolerant sorghum and millet, as well as other food crops. However, the Green Revolution of the 1960s – an international effort to boost crop productivity with the use of hybrid seeds, fertilisers and pesticides – encouraged farmers in this area to move away from growing a variety of food crops towards the production of cash crops, mainly cotton and soybeans.

The underlying problem driving the majority of farmer suicides in this region has been indebtedness. Farmers borrow money to put a crop in the ground and then low global prices, insect infestations, or poor rains lead to low returns. Increasingly, indebted farmers then turn to more informal sources (often village money lenders) for further loans at even higher rates. Sadly, this vicious cycle often leads to the male head of household committing suicide to avoid the humiliation of total destitution, typically leaving behind an even more impoverished wife and children.

So far this year, 660 farmers in the Marathwada region have committed suicide. This is up from 422 suicides for the same area during all of last year. Not counting this most recent year, nearly 300,000 farmers committed suicide in India between 1995 and 2014. Unlike other regions of the world where urbanites take their own lives at higher rates than rural folk, the suicide rate for farmers in India is nearly 50% higher than that of the general population. Suicides are also most concentrated amongst those farmers who grow cash crops (as opposed to those who grow food crops for their own consumption).

One bright spot is that crop failures in India rarely lead to hunger because of the state’s extensive public distribution system which guarantees access to basic food stuffs at affordable prices for the poor.

But that said, the farmer suicide situation is alarming and there is a collective clamour for the authorities to do something. The prevailing view, often expressed in the local Indian media, is that the system of chemical intensive, cash crop based agriculture is fundamentally sound and that marginal changes will make it function properly. These adjustments include more robust crop insurance, access to credit at reasonable rates, water at affordable prices, and inexpensive seed and chemical inputs.

But is the Green Revolution approach to agriculture really viable in this part of India and what can Africans learn from the current crisis?

While this year is admittedly worse than usual, with the monsoon rains only 50% of normal, many Indian farmers struggle in even the best of times. Several decades of cotton farming in Marathwada has led to soil degradation, declining crop yields and the need to use even more chemical fertilisers. Furthermore, the idea of promoting more irrigation is not really practical as many cities in the region are already forced to ration water in drier years. Funnelling more water towards agriculture would likely further deplete groundwater resources.

A green alternative?

There are new voices in India now calling for an alternative approach to agriculture. Some NGOs are working through farmer field schools to introduce new agroecological techniques. These include plant associations in diverse cropping systems to maintain soil fertility and manage pest problems, the use of earthworms to produce rich compost, the planting of less thirsty crops, and new water-harvesting techniques and conservation methods. The saving grace of this alternative approach to agriculture is that it does not rely on costly external inputs, and therefore farmers do not take on the risky debt that has been driving the suicide problem. It is also more sustainable over the long run because it is less demanding of the soil and water resources.

Given the shortcomings of the Green Revolution approach to agriculture in India’s Maharashtra state, it is not only the Indian government that must begin to rethink its approach to agriculture. We must question how Asia’s Green Revolution experience is being touted in Africa as the way forward.

Organisations such as the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the Gates Foundation, and the US Agency of International Development (USAID), argue that the first Green Revolution largely bypassed the African continent. The result, they suggest, has been a huge untapped agricultural potential and a persistent hunger problem on the African continent. Proponents of a New Green Revolution for Africa argue that the increasing use of improved seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, along with a more commercialised farming sector that involves agroprocessing, will increase farmer incomes and eliminate hunger.

But aid agencies and African authorities should carefully study the experiences of India with the first Green Revolution before uncritically adopting this approach. While it may be appropriate for the region’s wealthier farmers, this more capital intensive strategy is often too risky and environmentally problematic for poorer cultivators. They must also understand that India’s laws insuring affordable access to food have done more to combat hunger than unsustainable farming technologies.

240,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Rights Group Urges Obama to Address Abuses in Cambodia - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/rights-group-urges-obama-address-abuses-cambodia,"Human Rights Watch is urging U.S. President Barack Obama to use his upcoming visit to Cambodia to call for an end to longstanding human rights abuses, including alleged extrajudicial killings, torture, and abductions.



The New York-based rights group said in a report Tuesday more than 300 people have been killed in politically motivated attacks in Cambodia in the past two decades of Prime Minister Hun Sen's rule. The group says rather than investigate the crimes, Cambodia's government has instead ignored them and in some cases even promoted those believed to be responsible.



Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson tells VOA that President Obama, who next week will become the first ever U.S. president to visit Cambodia, is in a unique position to publicly demand human rights improvements.



""We're calling on President Obama to really strongly and publicly raise these human rights concerns, to press for accountability, and to insist that it can't be business as usual with the Cambodian government, given the gravity of these human rights violations,"" Robertson said.



The report praised the U.S. for being ""one of the most outspoken critics of the Cambodian government's human rights record."" But Robertson says Washington's actions have not always been consistent with its words.



""For instance, when the U.S. gave national police chief Hok Lundy an award [in 2006] for his contribution to anti-terror work. I mean, Hok Lundy was well-known throughout Cambodia as a brutal killer, someone who struck fear in the hearts of ordinary Cambodians. He was certainly no one who deserves any sort of accolade from the United States government,"" Robertson said.



During his 27 years in power, Prime Minister Hun Sen has repeatedly promised reforms, such as creating an independent judicial system and more accountable police force. But Human Rights Watch says he has not followed through on those promises, and that foreign governments have failed to hold him accountable.



Robertson says it is time for the U.S. and other governments and donors, which he says account for up to 50 percent of the Cambodian national budget, to insist on changes.



""The president should ... make it quite clear to Hun Sen that the U.S. is not fooled, that the U.S. is not having the wool pulled over its eyes, that it understands in a very clear way the human rights challenges that exist in Cambodia and that it is prepared to comment on those,"" Robertson said.



Cambodian officials have suggested that Prime Minister Hun Sen will hold bilateral talks with President Obama when the U.S. leader travels to Phnom Penh for the ASEAN and East Asia summits beginning next Monday.",2012-11-13 08:00:00+00:00,"['abuses', 'rights', 'robertson', 'watch', 'cambodia', 'human', 'group', 'president', 'address', 'sen', 'prime', 'urges', 'obama', 'hun']",India,news article,English
193,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought Kills Crops but won't Impact Milk Output - Opinion - Daily Mirror,http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Drought-Kills-Crops-but-won-t-Impact-Milk-Output-126472.html,"You may not believe me; I have news about the drought: Good news, better news, best news and the bonus.Did you know that the income from selling milk compensated the farmer’s losses incurred from crop failures during this period? That’s the good news as the farmer with dairy cows received 46.1% higher income this Maha season. The drought had a beneficial effect on milk production, increasing it by 77% during this period. That’s the better news. The cost of production of a litre of milk in the Dry Zone is between Rs.10 to 15 and the sale price is between Rs.65 to 80. Hence, the turnover is between 300 to 700%. Now that is the best news. In addition to these, there is an overall increase of 13.3% income per cow.

Can any agricultural enterprise match this?

Furthermore, consuming milk from Dry zone cattle is ecologically sensible, as these cows are part of an integrated agricultural system that raises crops primarily for human consumption. No dedicated crops were grown for them and their diets are mainly human food crop residue and naturally

growing grasses.

This news implies that Sri Lanka should capitalize in the Livestock sector sub-sector. Why? The effects of climate change and drought can be minimized by crop farmers rearing livestock. This is a fact. Such livestock enterprises can be considered as a facilitator for the sustainable growth of human food of crop origin. Here I am referring to an integrated farming system, which consists of around 95% of the ruminant (cattle, buffalo and goat) population of Sri Lanka. The prevailing drought condition severely affected paddy and highland food cultivation. Farmers usually start land preparation and planting paddy and highland crops from the beginning of September to October and November. It is safe to say that this expenditure is around Rs.40,000 per acre in both paddy and highland cropping and will be recovered after the sale of the harvest at the end of season. It was not to be, this time, as the prevailing drought destroyed their crops. However, farmers with dairy cattle recovered this amount within 21/2 months See table below.

With the advent of the Maha season, farmers are busy with land preparation, followed by crop cultivation and will have less time to attend to livestock activities. In this period, cattle and other ruminants are restricted to prevent any crop damage and easy management. They will not be provided with adequate amounts of food and water, no grazing and sometimes no milking, which will result in the loss of 2 million litres per year. The consequence of this restriction results in a low feed intake- and very little milk is collected during the Maha season when compared to the Yala season. However, due to the drought conditions in the 2016/17 Maha season, this has changed. This season, paddy land and highlands have been mostly abandoned and look bare but there is a luscious growth of grass, remnants of the failed crop and a few wet patches due to intermittent rains. Grazing herds are visible in these abandoned

crop fields.

This situation has allowed the milking herd to consume sufficient herbage to provide nutrients required for their body and milk production. However, unlike in a normal year, these animals were able to maintain a healthy condition and a nutrient reserve throughout the year that may have indirect results such as increased milk production, prolonged lactation period, increasing fat percentage and increase in the number of calves who would initiate milk production. This added income through these direct and indirect benefits will support the total farm activities in this crop-livestock mixed farming system. The following chart 1 shows an increase in milk production by 43.8%, 76.6%, 98.3% and 103.7% in the months of November, December, January and February respectively. This is contrary to what we usually witness in the regular Maha season (from 2007/08 to 2015/16) with normal rainfall.

Poor nutrition in the Maha season can cause severe problems in the cattle population. Indigenous cattle breeds were less affected but crossbreeding with European and Indian breeds showed poor growth, a shorter lactation period and longer calving intervals. A poor body condition is apparent through visible hips and pin bones, the outline of 3 to 5 ribs and the outline of the spine. Some of these features can be observed in the image 1 below.



Yet, after the Maha harvest, an ample amount of feeding will allow these cattle to recover and increase milk production. However, during the 2016/17 Maha season there is a sufficient amount of feed to maintain a favourable body score. This will reflect in increased lactation periods by about 30 days and reduced calving interval by about 2 months. Ruminant milk and meat production is predominantly a grazing farming system. This grazing farming system has failed to produce milk consistently throughout the year and supply milk to meet the demand. This is due to the quality of herbage available for grazing and owing to the lack of feed at critical times. In the past they were allowed to graze in forest and marginal pasture lands, in addition to uncultivated land in the Yala season (dry period) where irrigated water is provided only to cultivate around 30 - 40% land. Later, government regulations were legally enacted to prevent ruminant grazing in forest and marginal pasture land. The effect of this is the drastic reduction of ruminant population during the past two decades. In addition, the new paddy harvesting practice, through heavy machinery prevents the use of rice straw. However, there will be a fresh problem in the Dry Zone farming system with the new irrigation projects being able to provide sufficient irrigated water to cultivate the rest of the land during the Yala season (dry period) for only human food.

This will have a major consequence on the growth of the ruminant population, as this farming system will be completely cut off from the land. Hence, there is a need to transform this grazing milk production system to a stall feeding system in the dry zone. This is not possible unless an intervention to the feeding system is introduced.

Key lessons learned:

Modes of interventions not focused to the real problem for a paradigm shift.

Annual Loss of 2.2 million litres in the Anuradhapura and Trincomalee areas.

Continuation of the practice of grazing management (free grazing) system in Dry Zone.

Demand for replacement stock higher than the current supply.

Seasonality of availability of feed- no measures to increase shelf-life of crop-residue and grass.

Starvation and water deprivation effects physiology of cattle

Difficulties of women-headed families rearing cattle – Unable to take animals for grazing to distant places.

Impact needs to be generated:

Increasing crossbred population through artificial insemination (AI) and organized natural breeding system. Currently, crossbred pregnant heifer costs Rs.120,000. Half the population is of the indigenous types yielding 2 – 3 litres per day. Hence, to do any intervention that will result in a paradigm shift, there is a need to increase the crossbred population that will yield 10 to 15 litres per day.

The AI program has the capacity to supply around 40% of the required replacement and the rest either takes a long time to conceive or breed using a nondescript male unsuited to produce calves that can produce more milk. Milk marketing organizations will benefit from every calving, as it results in the inception of milk production. Hence, it will be advantageous to have a national programme for Natural Breeding managed by Milco through using good quality Jersey males from the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB). They should position one such stud unit per milk collecting centre. A member of this milk collecting centre will be responsible for maintaining this stud centre, where he economically benefits through the compensatation for the use of the stud bull for natural breeding.",2017-03-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['kills', 'impact', 'milk', 'land', 'opinion', 'grazing', 'wont', 'cattle', 'output', 'drought', 'crops', 'maha', 'population', 'period', 'production', 'season', 'system']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
1382,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt on high alert following Sudan floods - Arab News,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1733976/middle-east,"Syrian elections cause tension and violence in Lebanon

BEIRUT: Calls for Syrians in Lebanon to return to their country have become a deeply divisive politicized issue over the decade-long civil war in Syria, one which has recently been exacerbated by the upcoming election in Syria.



On Thursday, groups of angry Lebanese beat up Syrian expatriates and refugees heading to the Syrian embassy to cast their votes for next Wednesday's election, and threw stones at their vehicles, outraged over what they perceive as an organized vote for Assad. There have been rumors that Hezbollah organized transport for voters from across Lebanon to the embassy.



Assad is running for a fourth term, facing symbolic competition from two other candidates in a vote that is all but guaranteed to see him continue as president.



The Syrian opposition — as well as many Western and Arab countries — see the election as a sham designed to give Assad’s reign a veneer of legitimacy. The election also violates UN resolutions that call for a new constitution before a presidential vote.



Lebanon hosts 865,531 registered Syrian refugees, and there are several hundred thousand Syrians residing in Lebanon with their families as daily or seasonal workers.



Syrians in Lebanon include regime supporters and opposition figures who fled to Lebanon because of the war. Lebanon is in the midst of a severe economic crisis and is calling for Syrian refugees to return to their country because of the high cost of hosting them.



The roads leading to the embassy area in Yarzeh were congested with cars and buses loaded with voters since early Thursday morning. Many chanted slogans in support of Assad and the regime army, waving Syrian flags and carrying pictures of Assad. They confirmed to the media before and after the polls that they had voted for Assad.



Many Lebanese people reacted angrily to this. Members of the Lebanese Forces party went to the coastal highway that connects northern Lebanon with Beirut, and blocked cars carrying pictures of Assad, or Syrian flags, or banners for the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) — an ally of the Syrian regime, smashed car windows, and assaulted their occupants.

FAST FACT The roads leading to the Syrian Embassy area in Lebanon were congested with cars and buses loaded with voters since early Thursday morning. Many chanted slogans in support of Bashar Assad.

They told the media: “They are loyal to Assad, so why are they still in Lebanon as refugees?”



Members of the Lebanese Forces party also said that Assad-supporting Syrians should have their refugee status removed.



Similar scenes took place in Beirut’s Ashrafieh neighborhood, where young Lebanese men chased a car displaying the Syrian flag. The Lebanese army intervened to separate the two sides.



Fifty-four-year-old Mohsen Saleh Al-Ahmad died while traveling by bus from Chtaura, Bekaa, to the embassy. According to official preliminary investigations, he had a heart attack.



Since Thursday morning’s events, the army has tightened security in and around the Syrian Embassy, which is located in the vicinity of the Ministry of Defense and the Army Command, and on the roads leading to it.



But further clashes broke out in the afternoon, this time instigated by Syrians, who reportedly got off the buses transporting them along the coastal road near Nahr Al-Kalb and proceeded to assault passers-by and throw stones at cars, injuring several people, including journalists from MTV.



Some Lebanese politicians were quick to condemn the actions of pro-Assad Syrian voters.



Former minister May Chidiac said: “They claim to be displaced and are calling on the international community to support them with fresh dollars while they are an additional burden on Lebanon’s overstretched economy! At the doors of the Syrian embassy, ​​they are chanting for Bashar Assad. As long as you are not threatened, go back to where you came from.”



Another former minister, Richard Kouyoumdjian, said: “Swear allegiance to Bashar Assad in your country, not in ours. You are opportunists and you are not displaced.”



But former Hezbollah MP Nawar Al-Sahili described attacks on Syrian voters as demonstrating “racism and a lack of integrity.”



Syrian Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Abdul Karim Ali said those attacks were “painful, and we refer (them) to the concerned authorities” and called on Lebanon “to cooperate to find quick exits for the return of the Syrians to their country.”



The Syrian diplomat said that the large number of voters “reflects the desire of Syrian people to return to a safety that they have not found outside Syria.”



Lisa Abu Khaled, spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Arab News: “The UNHCR has received reports of incidents involving pressure, threats, and harassment affecting Syrian refugees in Lebanon and in relation to the Syrian presidential elections. The reported incidents range from confiscation of documents to threats of physical harm.”



She added: “Voting is a personal choice and is not linked to refugee status, nor to a person’s need for international protection. Voting will not lead to the loss of refugee status. The UNHCR has received reports of intimidation and pressure, which may have pushed a number of refugees to participate in the elections.



“The UNHCR is a non-political humanitarian organization, and therefore does not play any role in the Syrian elections,” she continued. “That said, if and when incidents of threats and pressure are reported by refugees, we work with the concerned stakeholders in Lebanon to ensure that refugees continue to be protected in Lebanon.”



Not all Syrian refugees in Lebanon exercised their right to vote. Abu Ahmad, a camp supervisor in a refugee camp in Arsal, told Arab News: “Most people are not interested. There may be some who voted at the embassy, ​​but they do not (symbolize) a collective conviction. Refugees are frustrated and cannot forget their suffering and the horrors they experienced during their displacement.



“What has changed now? How can Assad be re-elected? On what basis? People were hoping for some change to happen, but what is happening is the polishing of the image of Bashar Assad in front of the international community,” he continued. “Maintaining my strength today is more beneficial than wasting my time in front of the ballot box. Here, I feel safe even though I am homeless.”



Caretaker Social Affairs and Tourism Minister Ramzi Musharrafieh, who visited Syria a few weeks ago and discussed the return of refugees, denounced “all the infringements that have occurred and are unjustified,” and said that “protecting (Syrian voters) is our priority.”



Former MP Khaled Al-Daher, who has been a major advocate for Syrian refugees in Lebanon in the past, said on Thursday: “Anyone who wants to elect Bashar Assad from among the refugees in Lebanon will not have refugee status and must leave the Lebanese territories because they have no problem with the Syrian regime, but are in Lebanon for specific goals and objectives.”",2020-09-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['floods', 'lebanon', 'egypt', 'alert', 'refugee', 'high', 'syrians', 'sudan', 'lebanese', 'embassy', 'voters', 'assad', 'return', 'refugees', 'following', 'syrian']",Egypt,news article,English

(The writer can be reached at anuragborthakur@yahoo.com)

As the apparition of flood ruthlessly lashes vast swathes of Assam, it is yet another parade of blatant obliteration, dismantling whatever little semblance of menschiness the dogged populace managed to stitch together in the face of inexorable adversity. The situation continues to remain grim with no tangible solution in sight. It’s an unfortunate situation for one simple reason that occurrence of flood in Assam is a perennial phenomenon and it lays bare our utter lack of preparedness and a flippant comportment to effectively cope with the situation. The sheer enormity of the current bout of flood has tousled 4.5 million people residing in various parts of Assam, their lives thrown off gear in numerous ways. So many people have been pushed to a life of perpetual poverty, daunted and exasperated by this vicious cycle that they try so hard to extricate themselves from. Such pernicious episode of flooding brings with it a litany of encumbrances which menacingly eviscerate the affected people in ways that they meekly surrender to the inevitability of the crisis. Scores of people are rendered homeless, their fragility further compounded by an increasing susceptibility to various infectious diseases that follows such a crisis. Agriculture has been persistently assailed by recurrent floods destroying standing crops, decreasing the fertility of the soil and also resulting in soil erosion. This is a huge blow to the economic stability of the farmers, whose livelihoods largely depend on agricultural activities. Animal husbandry is usually the buffer that has been effective in alleviating the economic shocks that farmers are prone to in the event of large-scale crop failure. The tyranny of this flood has been so sepulchral and unsparing that livestock has been hugely hit and has led to deaths of a large number of animals. This has come as a double whammy for the farming community in one of the hardest-hit flood situations that Assam has ever experienced.

The damage wrought by this flood to the Kagiranga National Park has been so humongous and damaging that it is going to take us a long time to recover completely from the situation. According to officials data, a total of 187 animals, including 15 one-horned rhinos, 3 elephants and over 300 deer have perished in this ruthless inundation. These numbers are significant and dismaying enough to make everyone sit up and take serious notice. Veterinarians have been scrambled to aid in the rescue efforts but given the scale of damage inflicted by this deluge, it is going to take a lot of elbow grease to get anywhere around to containing the situation. Both medical and veterinary camps have been organized in several flood-affected places to ensure that proper mechanisms are in place to stymie the occurrence of disease outbreak. The Indian army has been steadfast in performing evacuation and rehabilitation programmes. They have been instrumental in getting medical camps organized in many flood-affected areas. In some districts, boat clinics are also being used to provide much needed medical aid to the flood-affected people. In places like Goroimari, in close vicinity to the Orang National Park, such boat camps have become an instant hit and a throng of people have visited these boat clinics to get medical aid. Boats are also being used to organize veterinary camps, particularly in areas that have been totally inaccessible via roads. There is a heightened need to keep an eye out for any outbreak of infectious diseases as the given situations are now highly conducive to rapid spread of diseases. The veterinarians from across the State have been stretched thin to cover the large tracts of land that remain submerged in water and provide necessary aid to the people in need. The paucity of veterinarians has been accentuated by the tearing hurry to engage sufficient manpower at different places in this time of crisis. There is a need for greater preparedness apropos the timely evacuation, proper rehabilitation, and access to food, clothing and medicines for flood affected people.

The situation is very grave and it requires much greater attention and awareness at a national level to surmount the crisis. The national media coverage has been largely inadequate and leaves much to be desired. There is a need to make the required noises to get our concerns heard. Social media should be extensively used to highlight the plight of people enduring prolonged periods of inundation. Contributions made to the chief minister relief fund would help a great deal to bring the situation under control. A collective approach and a concerted effort both on the part of government and the general public would go a long way in ameliorating the crippling situation of flood that Assam is currently confronted with.",2019-08-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'crisis', 'veterinarians', 'assam', 'national', 'ramifications', 'need', 'aid', 'situation', 'camps', 'farreaching', 'medical']",India,news article,English
811,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Let's Address Poor Quality ICT Services - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907110559.html,"Undoubtedly, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key driver of social and economic transformation, because its application enhances efficiency and effectiveness in services delivery.

With the application of ICT, we are able to store data and have quick access to information for decision making.

We have witnessed an appreciable level of installation of ICT infrastructure in the country, and its application has hastened the pace of national development.

That notwithstanding, there is more room for improvement in our ICT application in public service delivery.

The Ghanaian Times is particularly concerned about poor quality of ICT service that is militating against the two major registration exercises: The National Identification exercise for the issuance of the Ghana Card and the limited voters' registration that has just ended.

We understand a number of people have not been able to register in the limited voters' registration, due to challenges of the system, which has to do with the poor internet connectivity.

As a result, there are calls for the extension of the registration for the benefit of qualified electorates who could not still get their names captured in the voters' register, due to no fault of theirs, but because of the challenges with the system.

There are similar complaints of people spending so much time, and in some instance almost a whole day, queuing to register and obtain the Ghana Card.

We hear people go to the registration centres at dawn to queue, and that is creating inconvenience, as people have to go and eke out a living.

Indeed, this is affecting productivity in the public sector, as people have to take time off their schedules to go and register for the card.

Already, the Ghanaian worker is noted for low productivity, a bone of contention in the tripartite committee deliberations for improved condition of service for the worker.

We still remember the famous saying in the public sector ""Ghanaian worker is pretending to be working and the government is pretending to be paying.""

The recent United Nations human development index report suggest that though the Ghanaian worker productivity level pegged around 44 per cent, is one of the best in the sub-region, it is still low for a middle-level income country.

Ghanaians spend a lot of time in gridlock, resulting in man-hour lost in productivity. We spend much time queuing for ""Trotros"" at lorry stations during rush hours.

Again, we waste time in banking halls to cash our moneys. We queue to buy tickets to enter the stadium to watch matches. We queue to consult the limited doctors at the health facilities. We queue to register on to the National Health Insurance Scheme.

It will not be an over exaggeration to say that life in Ghana is all about queuing and time wasting.

The ICT has been invented to facilitate our lives, but it appears it comes with its own challenges of internet connectivity.

We commend Ghanaians for their positive responds to the national registration exercises and we plead with them to exercise restraint at the various registration centres.

The Ghanaian Times urges stakeholders in the ICT industry to endeavour to find lasting solution to the challenges facing the application of ICT in the country, for enhanced service delivery.

We also urge the Electoral Commission to consider the various appeals for the extension of the limited registration for qualified Ghanaians to get registered.",2019-07-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['poor', 'quality', 'national', 'limited', 'registration', 'ghanaian', 'service', 'queue', 'services', 'productivity', 'address', 'lets', 'register', 'application', 'ict', 'ghana']",Ghana,news article,English
1941,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Floods on record-high Lake Victoria show water cooperation needed - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20200819141141-rb3c8,"Unusually high rainfall has caused 'backflow' into Africa's largest lake, displacing communities and spurring calls for greater regional effort to manage water

By Justus Wanzala

BUDALANGI, Kenya, Aug 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenya's western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called ""backflow"".

""We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,"" said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

""There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,"" said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lake's water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

""Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Uganda's Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Uganda's environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the ""speedy movement of water into the lakes and rivers"" feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoria's shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

""While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,"" Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenya's government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

""The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,"" Opere said.

1872,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan: Building resilience against floods in its largest city - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/74703,"Source(s): World Bank, the (WB)



By Henrike Brecht and Ahsan Tehsin

Mehar Khan, 54, had poured his lifes savings into building a modest home for his family in Naya Nazimabad, a housing society in Pakistans largest city, Karachi. Karachi was particularly hard hit by torrential rains in August which caused around $1 billion in national economic damage and loss. Streets across the city turned into rivers and washed away many houses. Mehars family was one among thousands stranded in inundated parts of the city for days.

Pakistans financial and economic center, Karachi with its 16 million inhabitants is home to the country's largest corporations and main ports. Its economy has grown steadily for decades - last year its GDP was nearly $164 billion. The city has also made impressive progress in reducing poverty, which fell from 23 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2015.

Now, Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success? It doesnt have to. Moving forward, the city can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction:

Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success?

First, the sewage network needs an urgent overhaul. Karachi can reap large benefits from the development and implementation of a comprehensive Drainage and Stormwater Master Plan for the entire city. The World Bank is helping large cities implement drainage solutions for the 21st century and adapt to climate change, for example, in Yangon, Myanmar or Manila, Philippines.

Second, comprehensive solutions for solid waste management are important. Of the 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste generated each day in Karachi, 60 percent does not reach a dumpsite, and trash accumulates in drainage pipes. Across the globe, cities are employing new approaches to solid waste management, focusing on reduction and recycling. Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $4.7 billion to more than 340 solid waste management programs, for instance, in Indonesia or China.

Third, moving towards sponge city concept to absorb rainwater, prioritizing green infrastructure and permeable surfaces will go a long way to counter floods and heat. Instead of carrying the water away, these sponge cities treat it as a resource that is filtered by the soil and then stored. This ensures the economic and sustainable use of the valuable natural resource that fresh water constitutes. It also helps the city cool down through evaporation. This would involve stopping encroachment into urban wetlands and increasing water infiltration through greening, which would reduce the need for costly storm water drainage systems in the city. Chinas Sponge Cities Initiative provides $12 billion to more than 30 of its cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan, with the aim of re-using 70 percent of rainwater in 80 percent of the urban areas which are part of the program.

Karachi can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction.

Comprehensive policy changes would be as equally important as targeted investments to reduce flooding in Karachi. Responsibilities between agencies at national, provincial and local levels need to be clearly defined. Coordination among the different jurisdictions to develop entire-city approaches need to replace administrative fragmentation. Risk-sensitive land-use plans and their enforcement must ensure that new development takes place away from the most at-risk zones. New infrastructure and risk reduction strategies cannot be developed separately. These measures need to converge to help reduce the citys vulnerability in the long-term, for example, through building code development and enforcement. Strengthening Karachis emergency management response systems through drills and equipment will also reduce the impacts of disasters.

Challenging the status quo will not be easy. For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

But changing course will be cost-effective in the long-term. Pakistans National Disaster Management Plan 201222 ranks Karachi as the countrys most vulnerable district. Karachi is not only prone to floods but also to earthquakes, cyclones and more recently, heatwaves. Pakistan is also the fifth most affected country by climate change. If these vulnerabilities are not addressed, they will severely impact peoples livelihoods and Karachis economic competitiveness.

For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

The good news is that Karachi can benefit from existing developments and build on initial achievements. Pakistan shifted to an ex-ante disaster risk management approach after the 2005 earthquake. A National Flood Protection Plan, Pakistans investments in nature-based solutions and reforestation programs along with the Karachi Transformative Strategy pave the way. The World Bank continues to strengthen Karachis efforts to become more resilient. It committed $652 million in 2019 to reinforce the citys infrastructure and institutions with a focus on urban management, public transport, safe water, and sanitation.

Karachi also benefits from the Sindh Resilience Project, which invests in flood protection works and integrates disaster risk reduction in planning processes. The Karachi Neighborhood Improvement Project and the Hydromet and Climate Services Project also support climate sensitive and sustainable solutions.

The World Bank stands ready to assist Karachi in moving forward to become a world-class inclusive, sustainable and more livable city.",2020-11-12 08:00:00+00:00,"['largest', 'city', 'building', 'management', 'climate', 'pakistan', 'need', 'economic', 'water', 'karachi', 'floods', 'disaster', 'resilience', 'world', 'risk']",Pakistan,news article,English
988,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Mozambique Looks Beyond Cyclone Idai to Better Protection in the Future - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/climate/mozambique-climate-change-protection.html,"Storms seem stronger and hit beyond the regular rainy season from December to April.

In March, Cyclone Idai ravaged southeastern Africa in the “worst extreme weather event to occur so far this year,” according to the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. As the cyclone made landfall on March 14, heavy rain and unusually strong winds pummeled Beira and other parts of central Mozambique, as well as neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe. At least 2.8 million people in the three countries were affected.

The storm killed 598 people in Mozambique and as of early April injured more than 1,600 because of falling trees and debris, according to the government. More than 130,000 people across the country were displaced.

In Beira, about 300,000 people who live in flimsy housing in crowded, haphazard settlements are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. Dirty, stagnant floodwaters also breed mosquitoes and deadly diseases. In Mozambique, there were about 6,600 cholera cases and nearly 15,000 malaria cases in one province, as of April 22.

About six weeks later, Cyclone Kenneth hit northern Mozambique, killing at least five people and destroying nearly 30,000 homes.

1948,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Lake Victoria Breathes Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Recaptures Its Tributaries - Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/lake-victoria-breathes-amidst-covid-19-pandemic-recaptures-its-tributaries,"The intensive and prolonged rainfall in Uganda and East African region has caused a rise in water levels of Lake Victoria and all major water bodies in the country.

Recognizing that many parts of Uganda including Lake Victoria received above normal rainfall between mid- April to late June, 2020, water levels have risen further resulting in floods with severe effects around the country.

At Ggaba landing site located North of Lake Victoria and Port Bell, a small industrial Centre in the South of the Lake, life and settlement has been disrupted by the flooding water that has submerged the areas.

Places such as Ggaba and Port Bell markets have all been submerged by water and traders have resorted to selling food and other items on the road that leads to the markets. Similarly, happening places such as Ggaba Beach, K.K Beach, Miami Beach have been swallowed by water. Others that have been affected are Ggaba Water Works offices, Serena- Kigo Hotel, Speke Resort Hotel- Munyonyo, and several others surrounding the great water body.

The question on most people’s minds when they see a flooded market, homes and businesses on the shores of Lake Victoria is whether the beaches, landing sites, and some islands they have known all their life will resurface.

Standing at the flooded part of Ggaba landing site is Kassim Katende, the chairperson of the fishermen at Ggaba.

“Most of the community members here depend on fishing, but right now we do not have fish because the lake is full of water and security forces are guarding the waters,” lamented Katende.

Sarah Kaine, a businesswoman who sells food items at Gaba, expresses her fears for the dying business because of the flooding of the area.

""Our customers have disappeared and we are worried that we may not be able to continue with our business again. My selling point has been flooded and I have no other option but to wait until it dries up,” narrates Kaine in agony.

Mzee Sulaiman Kassujja a trader dealing in fish selling at the same landing site for the past 25 years narrates that, “we who sell fish are affected so much because fishermen no longer catch good fish and in large quantities. The few fish caught are very expensive.”

According to Sulaiman, the rise in the price of the fish has made their customers to opt for other substitutes such as meat and chicken. He further noted that the rise is also as a result of the challenge in accessing the catch from the lake and increase in costs as a result of lockdown.

Currently, a big tilapia goes for UGX 35,000 ($9.21), up from UGX 20,000 ($5.26), an initial price before the disaster outbreak.

Hamis Gamwero, the LC1 for Ggaba landing site and has lived in Ggaba for four decades said, “Since I came here in 1986, I have never seen this kind of flood. The people, especially traders are at a high risk of contracting other diseases, and it is worse that we have coronavirus.”

Kamadha Kakooza, the Katoogo Village, chairperson, told us that at least 500 families have already left the place and hundreds, which have been rendered homeless, have been accommodated in other peoples’ homes that are yet to be invaded by the overflowing water.

“When the water levels started rising, those who could, chose to vacate the area. Some [who had nowhere to go] remained. What we did was to talk to those who are yet to be affected to at least accommodate those affected for some time,” he said.

Meanwhile, at Port Bell in Luzira, which is also a rail link and a railroad ferry wharf used for International traffic across Lake Victoria to Tanzania and Kenya, the story is not different. The water has entered into houses of the dwellers and forced them to seek refuge somewhere else.

“People are trying to desilt the water by pouring sand but the environment authorities are against it,” said Teopista Nankinga, a women’s leader at Port Bell.

Markets and settlements near the Lake have severely been affected and homes submerged by the flooding water. The disaster has also been recorded at the same time when the country is under lockdown in March because of COVID-19. This means that the affected people are left with a few options for survival since most of them could not travel to their villages.

Many of these businesses and government installations were located outside the 200 perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government. Their destruction raises tough questions about the level of government planning. If the 200 meter perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government is not safe, what is safe? Suppose businesses move farther away from the expanded lake shore, what happens when the lake shore eventually recedes?

The continued downpour and flooding has had negative impacts on the people and property downstream of Lake Victoria during the time when the country and region at large is on a lockdown, as a means of controlling the potential spread of coronavirus.

Environment experts warn that the flooding of the lake tributaries has been accelerated by environmental degradation, which has caused a disruption of the water bodies.

Dr. Daniel Babikwa, the District Support Coordinator at the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), said that the communities encroached on the shores of the Lake, thus disturbing nature.

“Unfortunately, many people encroached on the shoreline and what you see now are the results of the impact,” said Babikwa.

On the same note, Beatrice Anywar, the Uganda State Minister for Environment, told us that most of the structures including Beaches set up around the Lake were illegal.

The Minister revealed that the government is encouraging voluntary migration of the settlement away from the endangered zones of the lake shores, and warned that action will be taken against those who will not leave.

In the same call, Dr. Tom Okurut, the Executive Director for NEMA, advises the affected residents to vacate the natural habitats lest they will be forcefully evicted.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Water and Environment on 1st May, stated that the Lake Victoria water level continues to rise to critical levels despite increased releases due to the increasing inflows and heavy rains in Lake Victoria Basin. At the same time, the Rivers discharging into Lake Victoria from upstream countries have uncontrollably more than doubled their inflows.

The current water levels that started last October (2019), have consistently continued to rise up from 12:00 meters to the current 13:32 meters, the second highest increase recorded since 1964, when the water level rose to 13:46 meters.

What Caused the Rise of Water Level?

Sam Cheptoris, Uganda’s Minister for Water and Environment, explained that Lake Victoria has over 23 rivers flowing into it from the three East African Countries that include Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

According to the Minister, when it rains, an increase in the waters from those rivers results into the direct increase in the water they pour into the largest freshwater lake in the continent.

“Some of these rivers originate from as far as Rwanda and Burundi: therefore, when it rains in those countries, water finds its ways into Lake Victoria,” explained the Minister.

Mr Cheptoris further noted that, “a number of areas around lakes and rivers have been identified as high flood risk areas and essential features such as schools, health facilities and places of worship are at risk.”

Is the Government Taking Any Measures?

In a communication by Minister Cheptoris, the government has put into place a number of measures to help address the problems of the rising water levels and associated floods.

Government has since instituted measures to immediately get water out of Lave Victoria through increased releases at Jinja which is now at the rate of 2200 cubic meters per second, up from the rate of 1000 cubic meters per second in October 2019.

A national Response team comprising the Ministry of Works and Transport, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Ministry of Defense and Veteran Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and, Ministry of Water and Environment. The team has ready equipment and Machinery to carry out surveillance and monitoring of the movement of the floating islands and removed those that are considered a threat to the electricity power generation.

The Inter-Ministerial committee has also been set up, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, comprising 14 Ministries and seven Agencies to implement Government response to the disaster.

In line to that, a multi-sectoral Technical Task team chaired by the Ministry of Water and Environment provides support to the Inter-Ministerial Committee and has already started on emergency works on: ensuring safety of Hydropower dams, protection of lives and, monitoring and surveillance of water resources and floating islands.

At the time of compiling this report, the lockdown in the country was preventing people from using public means of transport, some businesses such as salons, bars and open access markets were restricted from operation- and potentially putting the survival of the affected people at stake.

Although the number of COVID-19 infections have reached more than 1000, Uganda has continued to register almost 100% recoveries by July, 2020.

Lake Victoria which is shared by three countries; Tanzania (49%), Uganda (45%), and Kenya (6%), hit 1,134.38 metres above mean sea level (mamsl) on May 07. That is a difference of about 1.32 meters and is significant because Lake Victoria is a very shallow lake, especially on the Ugandan side where it averages a depth of just 40 meters.

Lake Victoria lies on an average elevation of 3,720 feet (1,134 meters) above sea level. Kampala is just 1,200 meters above sea level, a difference of about 70 meters. Ggaba, which is 60 meters above at 1,140 meters above sea level, is already inundated.

If the current rate of rise in water levels were to continue, the State House in Entebbe, and Parliament of Uganda in Kampala itself could easily find itself submerged.

211,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought doesn't cause famine. People do. - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-27/drought-doesnt-cause-famine-people-do,"A woman waits to be registered prior to a food distribution by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Thonyor, Leer state, South Sudan.

The United Nations announced this month that more than 20 million people in four countries are teetering on the edge of famine, calling the situation “the worst humanitarian crisis” since the end of World War II.

The key for avoiding the worst outcomes? Political will, experts say.

Modern famines are different from those the world faced 60 to 70 years ago. In the past, with less warning and less international support, more people died from hunger. In the early and mid-20th century, famines killed millions in Europe and Asia, in areas with much larger populations than areas which suffer from food insecurity today.

According to estimates from the World Peace Foundation, the deadliest famine in recorded history actually did take place after World War II. During China’s Great Leap Forward, about 30 million people died from hunger between 1958 and 1962.

What explains the UN's statement, then? They may be counting famines by decade, which would have split the Great Leap Forward crisis between the 1950s and the 1960s:

These days, famines cause death by the thousands, and are mostly confined to the Horn of Africa. Improvements in transportation and communications infrastructure have been successful in eliminating large-scale famines in virtually all other parts of the world.

But the current situations in Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria and South Sudan are undeniably harsh.

“Those people will suffer, their children will be malnourished, they will likely be displaced, lose their livelihoods, and some people will no doubt die as a result of this crisis,” says Dan Maxwell, a food security professor and director of the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University.

Maxwell exphasizes that modern-day famines are rarely caused by a lack of food. “There has never been a case that agricultural production causes famine alone,” he says. “It only causes a famine if someone lets it cause a famine.”

And that's where data become especially important. Measuring early indicators is crucial for averting famine, as is early investment. In its March announcement, the UN asked for $4.4 billion in emergency funding for intervention, and released $22 million in an emergency loan to Somalia on March 21.

“If we get to the point where a famine is declared, it’s essentially indicating a failure on the part of the international community,” explains Chris Hillbruner of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, or FEWS NET.

So, how do we measure the warning signs?

FEWS NET uses the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) 5-point rating system, which rates areas around the world to signal how serious food insecurity is there. The ratings go from ""minimal"" to ""stressed, crisis, emergency and famine.""

The scale, developed in 2006 and updated in 2012, is in use in 25 countries and gives a consistent measure for food insecurity.

“There should be a response at phase 3 and phase 4,” Hillbruner said. “Phase 4 is where people start dying because of food insecurity. If one waits until famine and then starts responding, inevitably it will be too late.”

To declare a famine, at least 20 percent of households surveyed in an area must face lack of food, and more than 30 percent of children in an area have to have a weight that is recorded as dangerously low. If you don’t have data that says that, you can’t declare famine even if people are starving.

The situation in Yemen is the largest food insecurity emergency in the world right now, according to FEWS NET. Seven governorates there are classified as phase 4. An estimated 17 million people, or 60 percent of the population, are food insecure.

In South Sudan, about 4.9 million are estimated to be food insecure and that number will climb to 5.5 million by July. Five counties are classified at 4 and 5 and will worsen.

FEWS NET officials struggle to access parts of Nigeria, and reported in December that a famine likely occurred in Bama and Banki towns and the surrounding rural areas in 2016.

In Somalia, 400,000 people are in IPC phase 4 and face starvation; 5.2 million others are in phases 2 and 3. It is facing its third famine in the past 25 years, including one in 2011 which left 260,000 people dead.

Hunger is a political issue

Maxwell says there’s a common misconception among the public that overpopulation and lack of resources are the main drivers behind food insecurity. (It’s a theory that was put forth by Thomas Malthus nearly two centuries ago.) In other words, that people starve because there's not enough food.

But Emily Farr, Emergency Food Security and Vulnerable Livelihoods team leader at Oxfam, says that's not the underlying problem. “We are talking about situations that are caused by human behavior,” she says.

The Horn of Africa region, where hunger is worst, is also prone to drought — but the impacts of climate change alone are not enough to create famine, experts say, so long as they are managed.

Farr emphasizes that fast-acting humanitarian response is important for mitigating famines, although the data can be hard to come by.

“There have been cases in the past where we haven’t been able to declare food insecurity as much as it was because we simply didn’t have the data,” Farr says.

Conflict especially can limit access. In South Sudan, for example, violence has claimed the lives of at least 12 aid workers this year and as many as 79 since 2013.

Innovations in technology, such as the World Food Program’s Mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping project, which uses cellphones to survey food security, can help fill in missing numbers. FEWS NET employs high resolution satellite imagery to estimate crop production and population displacement patterns.

Fundamentally, Hillbruner of FEWS NET describes famine as a humanitarian and political issue.

“I think there are times when it’s overstated that there are places we can’t get any information,” he said. “But when the political will is there, everyone suddenly has access.”

Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect the difference between populations in famine (IPC stage 4) and those facing severe food insecurity (IPC phases 2 and 3).

Scientists, conservationists lash out at government - The New Indian Express",https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/feb/07/avalanche-orglacial-lake-burst-in-chamoli-scientists-conservationists-lash-outatgovernment-2260907.html,"Vineet Upadhyay By

Express News Service

DEHRADUN: Scientists, experts, conservationists and activists have pointed out the lacklustre attitude of the governments when it comes to maintaining balance in development activities and environment.

Ajay Gautam, a Delhi-based activist who has filed range of public interest litigations in Uttarakhand high court requesting strengthening of disaster management systems said, ""I had filed one PIL in year 2014 requesting the honorable court to order installation of warning systems including alarm systems.

""The court had ordered the same in year 2018 but no compliance was done by the state government. This is apathy on the part of government which prefers concretization and deforestation of the hills which invites such disasters.""

Ravi Chopra, chairman of Supreme Court appointed high powered committee (HPC) on the 900 kms Char Dham Pariyojana, commenting on the issue, said, ""In the year 2014 we had submitted a report warning about hydropower projects at altitude of over 2000 meters voting various vulnerabilities which could result in a major disaster. Out of then proposed 24 hydropower projects, we recommended cancellation of 23. Altitude above 2000 meters is known as para glacial region where such heavy construction should be avoided.""

Views are still divided as to what caused this disaster. The experts have pinned down on two causes- an avalanche or a glacial lake burst.

""An avalanche is a volume starts moving from high altitude and gathers momentum destroying everything in its path. While glacial lake burst is a result of rainfall and snow when it collapses breaking down everything in its path. If it's glacial lake burst then it is a big failure for our remote sensing agencies,"" said Chopra.

The experts also added that the cause of the disaster needs to be investigated but mostly such occurrences are a result of lake formation.

D P Dobhal, former glaciologist at Dehradun's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, ""Lake formation must have happened for sure which eventually breached today and caused the floods. However, an extensive investigation is needed to confirm the reason which triggered this.""

Dobhal added that the heavy sediments in the flood waters indicate that an avalanche or glacial debris could have dammed the river waters resulting in the burst.

""It will take time to ascertain the reasons as happened with the 2013 disaster in Kedarnath. After investigation it was confirmed as glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF),"" said Dobhal.

Many expressed their shock at such an incident occurring in winters. They also added that contributing factors to the disaster can be increasing anthropological activities and construction in the hills.

Amit Kumar, a scientist from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology said, ""If this is a glacier break then it is shocking. The cause needs to be investigated thoroughly. Factors like global warming annd anthropological pressure are the reason for melting of glaciers worldwide.""

Interestingly, Uttarakhand high court in the year 2019 has ordered that the use of explosives to be prohibited in and around the Raini village, the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve and the Valley of Flowers, except with the prior written approval of the District Magistrate, Chamoli and on a license granted by a competent authority under the Explosives Act.

""The District Magistrate, Chamoli shall, forthwith, take necessary steps to prevent any form of illegal mining being carried on in the said area,"" stated the court order dated June 26, 2019 by division bench of chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice Alok Kumar Verma.

The court also said that resort to explosives, that too for carrying on illegal mining operations, may well result in destruction of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, and the Valley of Flowers said to be located nearby.

""While the respondent-Power Company states that they have not resorted to any form of illegal activities, and are not using explosives, we consider it appropriate to direct the Member Secretary, Uttarakhand State Pollution Control Board and the District Magistrate, Chamoli to constitute a joint inspection team to cause a physical inspection of the area; assess the extent of environmental damage caused thereat; ascertain whether illegal mining operations are carried on, and whether explosives are being used for the said purpose; and submit a comprehensive report to this Court at the earliest,"" the court order had stated.

Akash Vashishtha, a conservationist based in Ghaziabad who has filed litigations related to issues in Uttarakhand in National Green Tribunal said, ""Today's tragical incident in Chamoli and the consequent loss of life and property is yet another outcome of unabated obstruction of rivers by hydropower dams and encroachments/constructions on the water courses and channels in the state.

Nothing has been learnt from the June 2013 flood disaster in Uttarakhand, November 2015 Jhelum River (Kashmir floods), August 2015 losses in Chennai or the September 2019 Patna inundation. Even five years after the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016 notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, its provisions are not implemented.

Strange still, the Central Government has even shown no interest in tabling the River Regulation Zone (RRZ) draft bill (which is almost ready) in the Parliament.""

He further added, ""No earnestness has been shown by the Centre and State to follow the recommendations of the Supreme Court-appointed Ravi Chopra Committee report (to look into the causes of 2013 UK floods).

The ecological sanctity of the rivers in the state has been critically compromised with all these stifling constructions and is still being negotiated. Foolproof measures and zero tolerance policy is required for the protection of water channels and river courses and consequent safety and security of the people.""",2021-02-07 08:00:00+00:00,"['court', 'river', 'state', 'order', 'lash', 'chamoli', 'disaster', 'explosives', 'glacial', 'lake', 'uttarakhand', 'indian', 'conservationists', 'burst', 'scientists', 'result', 'express', 'avalanche']",India,news article,English
1191,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iran says recent floods caused up to $2.5 billion in damage - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-floods-idUSKCN1RQ093,"LONDON (Reuters) - Floods caused by heavy rain across Iran in recent weeks have caused an estimated $2.5 billion in damage to roads, bridges, homes and agricultural land, state media cited ministers as telling lawmakers on Sunday.

The flooding, which began on March 19, has killed 76 people, forced more than 220,000 people into emergency shelters, and left aid agencies struggling to cope. The armed forces have been deployed to help those affected.

“The recent floods are unprecedented... 25 provinces and more than 4,400 villages have been affected,” Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli was quoted as saying in parliament by state news agency IRNA.

Fazli said the floods had caused around 350 trillion rials ($2.5 billion) worth of damage.

Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammad Eslami said 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles) of road had been damaged and more than 700 bridges completely destroyed by landslides and flood water.

The government has said it will pay compensation to all those who have incurred losses, especially farmers but the Islamic Republic’s state budget is already stretched as U.S. sanctions on its energy and banking sectors have halved Iranian oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad.

Morteza Shahidzadeh, head of Iran’s sovereign wealth fund, said President Hassan Rouhani had asked permission from the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to withdraw $2 billion from the fund for reconstruction in flood-hit areas.

Shahidzadeh said Khamenei has in principle agreed to the request.

Iranian officials have repeatedly said the massive floods have not affected production and development at any oilfields, nor impeded the flow of crude through pipelines to recipient markets.

Karim Zobeidi, an official at the National Iranian Oil Company, was cited as saying on Sunday that it was still too early to estimate the extent of the flood damage to Iran’s energy sector.

Mehr news agency also quoted Zobeidi as saying that some oil wells in western Iran had been closed as a precaution to guard against any flooding.",2019-04-14 10:37:08+00:00,"['flooding', 'saying', 'floods', 'caused', 'damage', '25', 'zobeidi', 'recent', 'iran', 'oil', 'billion', 'state']",Iran,news article,English
294,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Persian Rugs: Still Priceless or a Magic Carpet Ride to Nowhere? - ThinkAdvisor,https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2016/06/20/persian-rugs-still-priceless-or-a-magic-carpet-ride-to-nowhere/,"For centuries the rich beauty of Persian rugs has been desired by collectors, decorators and individuals. The deep colors, natural fibers, ornate and intricate designs and famous loop weave all make the Persian rug that rare collectible: an item that’s at once usable and a piece of art.

Although other countries such as India, Nepal and Turkey, have recently stepped in to fill the gap — some even able to match the Persian beauty — none seem to provide that something which is magical and mysterious in the works from old Persia.

In 2010, Christie’s sold the Comtesse De Behague Kirma Vase Carpet from Southeast Persia, circa mid-17th century, for £6.2 million (approximately $8.8 million). Although there have been many Christie’s sales since, no Persian rug sale has matched that price, even a recent one of an almost identical rug. And as dealers and auction houses know, the market is fickle, narrow and cyclical.

“Lifting the embargo is something we anticipated for a long time,” says Oscar Tatosian, owner of Oscar Isberian Rugs, a store started in 1920 in Evanston, Illinois, by his grandfather (today they also have stores in Chicago and Highland Park, Ill.).

“It’s exciting because it offers a range of both antique and newly woven, highest quality Iranian carpets. “ It’s also a relief for Tatosian who says he was “teased” when attending auctions in Europe in the last several years “because we could look at the Persian carpets and admire them, but we couldn’t bring them into the U.S.”

So has that pent-up demand for Persian rugs led to a flooded market?

Not really, at least not yet. Elisabeth Parker, Christie’s International Head of Rugs and Carpets, says it’s still a bit early to know the impact of the end of the embargo. Christie’s did have an auction of Persian rugs in April 2016 which did better than previous sales, but that may have been because it included three Persian carpets with a Rothschild provenance.

“It’s a great story,” she says. “Three 17th century or earlier Persian carpets, virtually unknown, had been in the attic in one of the Rothschild’s homes. They didn’t know what they had. It was a perfect storm of great condition and beautiful pieces.”

One rug was complete and sold for $1.368 million, another one was a fragment, cut down from its original size and sold for £794,500 (approximately $1.128 million) while the final was a fragment, and sold for £542,500 (approximately $773,350). Some people just collect fragments.",2016-06-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['carpets', 'know', 'approximately', 'rugs', 'tatosian', 'ride', 'carpet', 'rug', 'sold', 'priceless', 'magic', 'persian', 'million', 'christies']",India,news article,English

Actor Mel Gibson will pay the mother of his 22 month-old daughter $750,000 and get joint custody of the child, ending a bitter custody and financial dispute that badly damaged his Hollywood career.

The ""Braveheart"" director and his former musician girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva agreed to a settlement detailed in a Los Angeles Superior Court hearing on Wednesday following a more than year-long war of words.

Judge Peter Lichtman banned both Gibson and Grigorieva from writing books about their relationship, which unraveled in early 2010 amid accusations of violence and extortion.

""I would like to thank your honor for bringing this matter to a reasonable conclusion,"" Gibson told Lichtman at Wednesday's hearing.

Grigorieva, who had been seeking millions of dollars from the Oscar-winning actor, thanked Lichtman for ""the tremendous help to resolve this situation.""

The acrimony between the couple became public a year ago when taped phone calls were leaked online in which Gibson was heard ranting, cursing and insulting Grigorieva.

The leak appeared to have been aimed at putting pressure on the actor to increase an initial settlement offer to Grigorieva that was reported to be around $15 million. Los Angeles prosecutors later decided against charging Grigorieva with extortion.

In March, Gibson admitted slapping Grigorieva during an argument and was sentenced to three years probation.

The widely-heard tapes further tarnished a reputation damaged by Gibson's 2006 anti-Semitic tirade following a drunk driving arrest in Malibu.

His manager quit, he lost a cameo role in ""The Hangover: Part Two"" because other people refused to work with him, and the release of his movie ""The Beaver"" was delayed and ultimately flopped at box offices in May.

Gibson, who was once estimated to be worth $900 million after a string of hit movies like ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The passion of the Christ"", reached a private settlement with his wife Robyn in June that wrapped up their divorce after 28 years of marriage.",2011-09-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['damaged', 'mel', 'financial', 'lichtman', 'gibson', 'settles', '750000', 'custody', 'grigorieva', 'los', 'angeles', 'settlement']",China,news article,English
