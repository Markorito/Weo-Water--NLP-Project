1195,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Nowruz floods in Iran anger many but reasons are complex - Atlantic Council,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/nowruz-floods-in-iran-anger-many-but-reasons-are-complex/,"Aerial photo of flooding in Aghqla, Golestan province (IRNA).

The Iranian new year, Nowruz, is supposed to be a time of joy and celebration when Iranians visit family and go on vacation in other provinces. But for many this year, it was a time of sorrow and loss. Heavy rains, first welcomed in the drought-stricken country, turned into catastrophic floods. Twenty-eight of Iran’s thirty-one provinces were underwater during the two-week holiday.

So far, 43 people have reportedly died in flashfloods and tens of thousands have been displaced. The historic city of Shiraz in Fars Province was the hardest hit, with 19 dead.



According to the Washington Post, “Part of what made the city so vulnerable to flooding amid seemingly less-than-impressive rain amounts is its location in the Zagros foothills.” This may have prompted a funneling effect in the capital of Fars province. The World Meteorological Organization reported that Shiraz gets an average of 1.91 inches of rain every March, but the torrential rainfall this time totaled 2.33 inches—more than a month’s worth in just a few hours.

Early investigation into the flooding also shows negligence on the part of the local government. The governor of Fars province claimed that warnings were issued two weeks prior to the floods. Angry Iranians took to social media to point out that if there was cause for concern, vulnerable streets should have been blocked. As one Iranian Twitter user (@musafa_sh) commented in Persian: “How are you able to block people on [Cyrus the Great Day] and not even allow a bicycle to enter Pasargadae, but when you know people’s lives are in danger you can’t block them then?”

Environmental experts have noted that the loss of vegetation and soil as well as deforestation have made water more likely to run off than be absorbed into the ground. The deputy for construction to Mazandaran’s governor denied any correlation. Still, over the years, the Iranian government has been guilty of poor water management and has become complacent about flooding in part due to the extensive construction of dams. At an event at the Atlantic Council on March 27, Kaveh Madani, a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of the Environment, noted that “people have lost the memory” of flood plains because of dams. With record rainfall caused in part by climate change, the dams that have been built are now insufficient to prevent flooding. But the reaction, Madani explained, is that Iran should build even more dams.

In the most recent case, it took two days for a government response to the humanitarian disaster that began to spread on March 19. It didn’t help that emergency responders were overwhelmed, and possibly understaffed due to the Nowruz holiday.

Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, was reportedly vacationing on Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf when news of the floods made headlines. Reuters reported that many Iranians on social media criticized him for remaining on holiday in the south, while floods devastated the north. By March 23, Rouhani ordered the Interior Ministry to hasten plans to help residents in Golestan and Mazandaran provinces. Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, who arrived in Golestan’s capital, Gorgan, that day, reportedly fired its governor because he didn’t cut a trip abroad short to address the devastation.

On March 26, a video emerged of the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, trudging through the murky waters of Golestan province to visit flooded areas.

It took seven days for Rouhani to finally visit provinces hard hit by the floods—likely a response to Jafari’s visit. At a National Disaster Management meeting in Golestan province on March 27, responding to criticism, Rouhani said, “I had planned to come in the first days, but ultimately due to considerations, it was decided the first vice president would travel here.”

Much of the criticism of the Rouhani administration’s slow response to the floods was found on social media and came from hardline government officials. It’s estimated that the floods caused millions of dollars in damage to farms, homes, and infrastructure. The Iranian government has pledged 7.1 trillion rials (about $169 million) in compensation to those impacted by the floods.

Pope Francis “expressed sorrow” for the Iranian flood victims and prayed for those who lost their lives, while the State Department’s Persian language Twitter account (@USAdarFarsi) tweeted condolences to the families of the flood victims on March 25 and said that the United States is “always ready to help.” (How exactly it can help given US sanctions is unclear, although some US-based NGOs reportedly have licenses to collect donations.) Austria, Armenia, and Turkey have also stepped in to offer humanitarian assistance.

Iran’s Energy Minister Reza Ardekanian, who also manages the country’s dams and water supply, blamed the floods on climate change. “Climate change is forcing itself on our country” and is part of a worldwide problem, he said. However, experts such as Madani blamed poor management of resources as well as the Iranian government’s persecution of environmentalists with ties to the West.

In the past, some Iranian officials have relied on conspiracy theories to shift the blame for environmental challenges and humanitarian disasters. In July 2018, the chief of Iran’s civil defense claimed that neighboring enemy countries, including Israel, were stealing Iran’s clouds and snow—essentially blaming outside forces for a prolonged drought.

Madani denied any notion that a conspiracy was behind the devastation by tweeting: “The recent floods in the country were not caused by rain-laden clouds, the HAARP project, or the stealing of clouds!” He repeated this comment at the Atlantic Council’s ‘Environmental Security in the Middle East’ event.

The Rouhani administration hired Madani, an Iranian-born water conservation expert, from the Imperial College London, in 2017 to deal with Iran’s water challenges but he ended up fleeing the country a year ago. Madani was constantly harassed and interrogated by the intelligence arm of the IRGC who viewed him and other environmental experts with suspicion. Since February 2018, a dozen environmentalists have been rounded up and imprisoned on bogus charges. Kavous Seyed-Emami, a prominent Canadian-Iranian academic and environmentalist, reportedly died under suspicious circumstances—leading some to believe he was tortured to death.

Meanwhile, Ahmad Reza Djalali—a Swedish-Iranian with crisis management expertise—who is facing the death penalty, was interviewed at Evin Prison through an intermediary. Djalili explained that most emergency response drills focused on earthquakes, and that the threat of floods has been largely ignored. He added that part of what contributed to the floods in Shiraz was the obstruction of flood outlets and dry river beds by construction.

So far, Rouhani’s slow response has only further angered Iranians who had already grown frustrated by his broken promises and the poor state of economy, which has been hammered by a combination of re-imposed sanctions, mismanagement, and corruption.

Recognizing climate change is a start. But a bigger gesture would be for the Iranian government to admit its own faults in contributing to the country’s environmental challenges, while consulting and working with Iran’s foremost environmental experts instead of jailing them and chasing them into exile.

Unfortunately, for the time being, the Iranian government has chosen the opposite route.

The weather in north India was predominantly sultry, whereas monsoon rains occurred in several areas in the western, central, eastern and northeastern regions, including Gujarat's Saurashtra where seven persons were killed in separate incidents of lightning strike.

In the national capital, a partly cloudy sky and light rain in isolated areas kept the mercury in check. However, humidity levels shot up to 91 per cent, causing inconvenience to the residents.

The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for Delhi, recorded a maximum of 37.5 degrees Celsius, as against 40.7 on Monday. Most places recorded their maximum temperatures between 36 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius.

According to an official bulletin in Assam, flood water receded from two districts -- Udalguri and Kamrup (Metro) -out of a total 25 affected.

The flooding has submerged over 1.5 lakh people and claimed 25 lives, of whom three died on Tuesday -- two in Barpeta district and one in Dibrugarh.

One more body has been recovered from a flood-hit area in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district, taking the number of deaths in the glacial disaster to 62, even as search and rescue operations continued on Friday for the 13th day at the NTPC's Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project site.

One body was recovered late on Thursday night from the banks of the Alaknanda at Helang between Joshimath and Pipalkoti, Chamoli district police said on Friday.

The body was found at a coffer barrage of the THDC, it said. With this recovery, the number of deaths in the February 7 disaster has risen to 62 while 142 people are still missing, they said.

The number of bodies recovered from the intake Adit tunnel of Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project where a massive search operation has been under way ever since the tragedy struck still stands at 13.

Besides, 28 human limbs have also been recovered from different places in the affected area out of which one has been identified. Thirty-three bodies out of the 62 recovered so far have also been identified, police said, adding the DNAs of unidentified bodies are being preserved.

The glacial burst over Rishiganga had triggered an avalanche which had demolished a 13.2 MW hydel project along the river besides causing extensive damage to the NTPC's Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project along Dhauliganga.

1700,FL-2021-000038-KEN,Uganda: Kenyan Officials in Uganda to Verify Sugar Production Capacity - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202104140704.html,"A Kenyan delegation is currently in Uganda for bilateral talks over strained trade relations.

The Kenyan team is led by Betty Maina, Cabinet Secretary for Industrialization, Trade, and Enterprise Development.

Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Kenyan and Ugandan officials will conduct a sugar verification exercise as well as discuss market access challenges for poultry, maize and dairy products, and other non-tariff barriers.

Earlier this year, Kenya restricted importation of milk, maize and poultry products from Uganda, and Ugandan legislators threatened to retaliate.

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni on Tuesday said he met with the Kenyan team and discussed trade relations between the two countries in light of trade barriers.

""Competition has been generated by the fact that we are trading in a common market, however, the ultimate logic of EAC (East African Community) integration is that one who is more efficient should be allowed to sell. We should eliminate irregularities with strategic analysis, not endless fights,"" Mr Museveni said.

Grace Adong, Uganda's acting Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, said the interactions between the two sides aim at building a strong regional block with less trade restrictions.

Ambassador John Weru, the Principal Secretary of Kenya's State Department for Trade, was positive that the ongoing week-long deliberations would bear positive results.

The team will this week embark on a sugar verification mission which will see them visit more than 14 sugar factories around the country to ascertain Uganda's sugar production capacity.

Uganda's annual sugar production capacity currently stands at approximately 550,000 tonnes but its domestic consumption is 360,000 tonnes, according to official data.

In March 2019, Uganda secured concessions to increase its sugar quota to Kenya from 36,000 to 90,000 tonnes on condition that it meets the rules of origin criteria established under the EAC.

Following a midterm review in December 2019, the two parties noted that the sugar exports had increased from 36,000 to 57,273 tonnes as of October.

It was then agreed that a verification mission would be undertaken by Kenya to ascertain the origin of Uganda's sugar before Nairobi can consider increasing the quota to 90,000.

Uganda's sugar stocks have now accumulated to 65,000 tonnes worth $40 million and are held in various stores across the country.

495,DR-2021-000054-SOM,A Region on the Move: 2020 Mobility Overview in the East and Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/region-move-2020-mobility-overview-east-and-horn-africa-and-arabian-peninsula,"INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 outbreak has marked the beginning of a new global paradigm, where unprecedented shifts in the capacity of governments to issue multiple restrictive measures impacting movements were observed in a highly fluid mobility environment. In line with a continental trend, the EHoA was less severely affected by the pandemic from a health perspective, and countries have been progressively lifting some movement restrictions during the second half of the year. However, the pandemic is far from over, as governments and authorities continue to issue new mobility restrictions and policy changes, while the socio-economic impact of repeated lockdowns and renewed closures of points of entry (PoEs) are yet to be fully assessed.

Home to an estimated population of 331 million, of which 42 per cent are under the age of 15, the region hosted 6.2 million international migrants at mid-year 2020. With over 6.5 million IDPs and more than 3.6 million refugees and asylum-seekers recorded by the end of the year, countries in the EHoA have continued to experience significant levels of internal and cross-border mobility, although at a reduced pace. Mobility in the region is still triggered by a combination of persistent insecurity and conflict, harsh climatic shocks and conditions, in addition to socio-economic drivers and more traditional seasonal factors, fueling intra- and extra-regional movements. These intertwined flows of IDPs, migrants and refugees are strongly influenced by historical and cultural links such as those tying similar communities separated by borders in the HoA and in the Great Lakes region, as well as by dynamics of labour supply and demand, locally and towards the Gulf countries. At the same time, the pandemic has also generated new trends, while exacerbating existing vulnerabilities of the most fragile population groups.

Hosting some of the world’s most severe protracted displacement contexts, the region has also witnessed new waves of displacement due to hostilities affecting the Tigray region of Ethiopia since the beginning of November. Multiple countries were also hit by repeated drought, a cyclone, and regular flash and riverine floods. The pandemic has also accentuated the existing socio-economic vulnerabilities of these displaced populations and further hampered the achievement of sustainable and durable solutions. These aspects are further investigated in the Forced Displacement section with a focus on four countries which have reported the most volatile conditions in 2020.

New mobility trends were particularly evident along the Eastern Route, which runs from the HoA to the Arabian Peninsula, in particular to Saudi Arabia, and which has long been the most relevant migratory corridor in the region in terms of volume and characteristics. At the beginning of the outbreak, when restrictions were the most severe, a switch in routes was observed as migrants attempted to cross through Somalia rather than Djibouti where border closures were enforced more effectively. Soon enough, many stranded migrants were reported in different parts of the Horn, unable to proceed or return to their place of origin. The increased pressure, coupled with fears of contamination, resulted in a widespread xenophobic and discriminatory narrative, limited or curtailed access to coping strategies and basic services along the journey, in addition to episodes of detentions and deportations. By the end of the year, it is estimated that at least 2,700 migrants were stranded across the region, with a further 32,700 EHoA migrants stranded in Yemen, out of which an estimated 6,200 were in detention. In 2020, only 37,535 new arrivals from the HoA were tracked along the coast of Yemen compared to the same period in 2019, corresponding to a reduction of 73 per cent. Overall, this corridor reported a 66 per cent decrease in movements due to a sharp fall in monthly movements as of March 2020 (from 468,234 movements in 2019 to 157,702 in 2020). Most interestingly and of relevance were the return trends observed from Saudi Arabia and Yemen to the Horn, which were halted or reduced during the year, whereas an increasing number of migrants were observed to return spontaneously from Yemen to the Horn using the same network of smugglers. The complexities, risks and consequences of such revamped bi-directional trends are analyzed in depth in the Regional Mixed Migration Trends section, together with an analysis of migrant movements along the other main corridors affecting the EHoA.

This edition builds on multiple IOM data sources, whereby the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) constitutes the main methodology used to track and monitor displacement and population mobility, as it maps IDP and returnee stocks, migration flows and characteristics of populations on the move.

Further migrant data is collected by IOM through modules targeting specific sub-groups of these populations at different stages of their migration journey. The analysis is further enriched through findings of multiple research efforts being conducted along the Eastern and Southern Routes, as well as external sources to provide a holistic understanding of the articulated population movement dynamics stemming from this region. To this end, a Regional Data Hub (RDH) was established at the beginning of 2018 to promote evidence-based migration dialogue, lead regional research efforts and foster a multi-layered analysis of regional migration data.",2021-05-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['region', 'migrants', 'africa', 'regional', 'peninsula', 'world', 'east', 'trends', 'yemen', 'arabian', 'displacement', 'migration', 'horn', 'countries', '2020', 'mobility', 'overview', 'movements']",Somalia,news article,English

Addressing a joint press conference with President Lourenço, President Akufo-Addo said that the bilateral talks centered on putting ""Ghana-Angola relations on a new level.""

The President said the two leaders had resolved to collaborate on all fronts, including ""working for the eradication of poverty in Africa, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and for the search for global peace and security to promote sustainable development around the world.""

He said the meeting, also, centered on boosting the political and economic relations, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, as well as co-operation at the multilateral level.

""Our deliberations also centered on driving investment opportunities, domestic and foreign, into our two countries, and the need for enhanced co-operation and partnership in our development efforts. Towards the realization of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we touched on the need to promote a better world, and addressed global issues relating to the 17 Goals,"" he added.

The President expressed Ghana's appreciation to the Government and people of Angola for the support Ghana received in her bid to host the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

The two leaders, also, held closed door discussions - the ministerial teams of the two countries held discussions aimed at deepening the bilateral relations between the two countries - exploring in detail, areas of possible co-operation between Ghana and Angola for the mutual benefit of their two peoples.

The discussions also focussed on the areas of education, trade and industry, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, environment, science and technology, petroleum and hydrocarbon activities, and tourism, were held in an atmosphere of fruitful cordiality.

""As a result, we have agreed to revive and convene the 6th Session of the Permanent Joint Commission for Co-operation between our two countries, within the next two months, to be held in Luanda. The Commission serves as the legal framework for addressing the trade and investment concerns of our two countries,"" President Akufo-Addo noted.

President Akufo-Addo indicated that as Angola and Ghana were united by their common struggle to free their peoples from foreign domination and exploitation, ""so we are united in our determination to win the battle for rapid economic development, by helping to transform our economies from dependence on the production and export of raw materials into value-adding, industrial economies, anchored on the things we make and grow.""

626,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Governments in sub-Saharan Africa are restricting religious freedom at the expense of security more than anywhere else globally - Quartz Africa,https://qz.com/africa/965389/governments-in-sub-saharan-africa-are-restricting-religious-freedom-at-the-expense-of-security-more-than-anywhere-else-globally/,"Countries in sub-Saharan Africa experienced the largest increase in social hostilities towards religious people globally in 2015, a new Pew Research Center study shows. This aggression stemmed largely from government harassment of religious groups in the name of security, and increased antagonism towards minority religions or practices.

Sub-Saharan Africa witnessed a 13% uptick in attacks against Muslims in 2015 compared to the previous year. The study uses two 10-point indices to rate 198 countries and self-governing territories on the prevalence of laws, policies, and actions that restrict religious beliefs and practices through things like government restrictions and social hostilities. The results showed that the median level of violence in sub-Saharan Africa rose to 2.2 points in 2015 from 1.5 in 2014. On the measure of social hostilities defined by Pew as “actions aimed at members of religious groups by private individuals and social groups,” including “hostile rhetoric, vandalism, and physical assaults,” Niger had the largest increase to two points, followed by Chad, South Sudan, and Burkina Faso.

Examples of these incidences included targeted bombings and shootings carried out by extremist groups like Boko Haram. Governments, wary of these groups’ actions, have responded by imposing severe restrictions on religious practices or prohibited the donning of certain attire, like the full-face veil.

The Pew report details examples of some of these aggressive actions. The Chadian government banned burqas in June 2015 for fear that attackers would use the loose garment, which covers the whole body, to hide explosives (a month later, a man dressed in a burqa killed 15 people in a market in the Chadian capital of N’Djamena). That October, the government arrested 62 women for wearing burqas. The governments of the Republic of Congo and Niger have also banned the full veil, citing security concerns. Headscarves are also a contentious issue in Kenya and Ghana, where students have been asked in some cases to remove their hijab before sitting for exams.

In August 2015, Muslim women in Cameroon reported being harassed at a highway roadblock by a police officer for wearing religious headscarves, even though a nun with a longer covering was allowed to pass. Following raids on a number of Quranic schools in Cameroon’s far north suspected of recruiting for Boko Haram, the government also arrested 84 children who remained in juvenile custody for months without being charged.

In Rwanda, members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses were arrested, beaten, and dismissed from government agencies and school between May and June 2014 for refusing to touch the national flag while taking oaths of office, and for not participating in community night patrols or school religious services. The group believes that saluting or bowing down to flag ascribes salvation to the state and not God.

Environmental changes, like desertification and persistent drought, is also driving religious strife. Clashes between Muslim Fulani herdsmen and predominantly Christian farmers over pasture and grazing land in Nigeria, for instance, poses a security threat bigger than Boko Haram, SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based intelligence consulting firm estimates.

These fissures threaten to undermine the tolerance and solidarity shown by Muslim and Christian communities who have coexisted side by side across the continent for years. Whether it’s the Islamic State bombing churches in Egypt, governments cracking down on religious practices, or al-Shabaab attacking churches and universities in Kenya, these unrelenting attacks are testing leaders’ ability to sustain longstanding religious harmony. The situation is also compounded by a demographic shift that will see more Christians and Muslims living in sub-Saharan Africa in the years ahead. By 2060, more than four in ten Christians will call the region home, up from 26% in 2015, while Muslims living in the region will increase to 27% from 16%—making it the most populous region for Muslims globally after the Asia-Pacific region.",2017-04-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'security', 'social', 'region', 'actions', 'freedom', 'groups', 'expense', 'restricting', 'muslims', 'religious', 'quartz', '2015', 'governments', 'subsaharan', 'globally']",Ghana,news article,English

On Friday, when the fifth shutter of the Idukki dam was opened, Kanhaiya Kumar, an NDRF rescue operation officer who hails from Bihar, risked his life as he crossed the Cheruthoni Bridge to rescue a child seconds before the bridge went under water.

In the visuals captured by News18 Kerala’s Kannan Prasannan, Kanhaiya is seen sprinting from one end of the bridge to the other to save the child as waves swept the bridge later.

“I was helping people evacuate from the vicinity of Cheruthoni Bridge, and then I noticed a man with a kid in his hands yelling from the other side of the river for help. In no time, I helped the kid and two others to safety and get primary medical aid,” Kanhaiya Kumar told News18.

Kanhaiya received a wireless message to take the child suffering from high fever to the nearest hospital. Wasting no time, he scurried across the bridge while holding the child in his arms.

“I realised that I can help by taking the child to nearest hospital in a safer place for first-aid and I did exactly that,” Kanhaiya told ANI.

1908,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Urban flooding: the case of Karachi - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/74376,"Source(s): International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)



By Arif Hasan

Before 27 August, this monsoon season had brought much less rainfall to Karachi than on previous occasions. Yet, streets turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, and over 30 people drowned or were electrocuted.

However, on 27 August we had more rainfall in one day than the past 92 years. Entire settlements were washed out. This has raised two questions. One, despite a lower volume of rainfall, why has Karachi been devastated? And two, was the heavy rainfall of 27 August linked to climate change?

Vast population increase and lack of investment in sewers

Karachis storm water drains connect to two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other, 14-20 kilometres apart. Fifty-eight storm water drains (nalas) carry water from their catchment areas to these two rivers. Over 600 smaller drains feed into these nalas.

Before independence in 1947, Karachis population was only 450,000; it is now over 15 million. The citys sewage system mostly consisted of underground earthenware pipes, and sewage biologically treated at the gutter baghicha (gutter garden).

The treated effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. The gutter garden covered just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares).

With Partition and the arrival of around 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand. Formal and informal sectors developed far away from the gutter garden.

The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns some 20 kilometres from Karachi. Sewage treatment plants were planned for but never constructed and their sewage flowed (and still flows) into the sea and/or the nalas.

Informal settlements and informal drains

Due to lack of housing, informal settlements developed along the nalas  into where sewage was discharged. After the mid-1960s formal sectors also began using nalas for disposal. Sludge from sewage clogged the nalas and their tributaries, and during the heavy rains of 1978-79, much of the housing along the nalas was washed away.

After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities and compact it along the nala edges to secure them and to create land for their homes. Nala widths decreased substantially from 20-40 meters to less than ten, and four to five metres in some places.

Deterioration of the nalas

Spatially, Karachi is a large city with only two landfill sites, both over 40 kilometres from the eastern edge of the city. Due to the time and costs to get there, garbage increasingly did not reach the landfill sites. Meanwhile, a recycling industry developed, mostly in the informal sector.

Contractors pay the Karachi Metropolitan Cooperation (KMC) officials not to collect the garbage so that recyclable material can be picked from it. The non-recyclable material is then thrown into the nalas or at various informal dumping sites along the natural drainage systems.

By the mid-1990s, most of the nalas were full of compacted solid waste. And to this day children play cricket and football on some of them.

Building over the nalas

With Karachis development plans stalled and space pressures for commercial activity, the local government constructed bazaars over the nalas. Meanwhile, the government of Sindh constructed car parking facilities, offices, and hostels on the nalas, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

As space for disposal of solid waste in the nalas reduced over time, solid waste was and is still used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite housing. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire tractors to compact it.

A major part of Karachis most elite settlement  the Defence Society  has been reclaimed from the sea through use of municipal solid waste. In addition, two of Karachis major outlets to the sea have been considerably reduced by developing housing for high income groups and a highway. Now, water struggles to flow out into the sea especially during high tides.

Storm water drains

To overcome these problems, in the 1980s and 90s the government of Sindh arranged for old sewage treatment plants to be rehabilitated and new ones constructed along with trunk sewers along the main roads. However, these trunks remain dry because the sewage continues to flow in the storm water drains.

The Orangi Pilot Project Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) has long supported communities to develop lane sewers and decided to document the storm water drains. It discovered this problem could only be tackled by cleaning and covering the drains and incrementally building trunks along the nalas. This concept was accepted by the state and is being partially implemented.

Real estate development

But now, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels and water collection depressions.

When it rains, areas south of this region are completely submerged by flood waters. With more developments, the likelihood of flooding will also increase.

Serious institutional issues

The central and provincial governments are controlled by different political parties. They are at constant loggerheads making it impossible for Karachis infrastructure problems to be tackled rationally and with sufficient finances. It also makes it impossible to develop a decentralised city government, free from direct provincial control.

Desperate to maintain its vote bank, the federal government brought in the National Disaster Management Authority to de-silt Karachis nalas. So far they have removed 30,000 tonnes of solid waste from 42 choking points on three nalas.

However, desilting will once again make the edges of the nalas vulnerable to erosion and destroy an unspecified number of homes  widening just one major nala will require 5,782 houses to be removed.

If the proposal for widening all the nalas to their original width is followed, around 60,000 houses will be affected. So far, a concept for the rehabilitation plan has not been developed even though promised by the government.

Tackling these issues will require a long-term plan for Karachi that is in keeping with the finances available or that can be generated. But this cannot be done without an empowered local government and participation of people living along the nalas.

OPP-RTIs interaction with those communities found only they knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of various smaller drains that had disappeared. But how to bring these communities into the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

Meanwhile, climate change only adds to the urgency of addressing Karachis worsening floods.

1984,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Heavy rains may mar quality of Ugandan coffee crop: official - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-coffee-idUSKBN2330PZ,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - The quality of Uganda’s coffee crop may decline in the coming months as heavy rains across the east African nation have reduced the amount of sunshine necessary for bean drying, an industry official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Uganda is Africa’s largest exporter of coffee followed by Ethiopia and grows mostly robusta variety.

The country has been pounded by unusually heavy rains that started in August resulting in deaths, displacement and extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure.

Western Uganda, including the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains that are among the biggest coffee growing areas, has received some of the most intense rains.

“The drying process is a major problem in most of the places...the weather is not good for drying,” David Muwonge, head of marketing at the National Union of Coffee Agribusiness and Farmer Enterprises (NUCAFE) told Reuters.

“There’s a higher risk of beans becoming mouldy unless farmers are well sensitised.”

Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), the state-run regulator, forecasts Uganda’s bean exports will climb 16% to 5.1 million 60-kg (132-pound) bags in the current crop year ending September.

The country’s coffee output has surged in recent years, the fruition of a government programme that has been distributing free seedlings to farmers to expand acreage and replace aging trees.

Authorities say their target is to help boost annual production to 20 million bags by 2025.

The beans have traditionally been Uganda’s biggest commodity export but were recently overtaken by gold which now annually earns the country over $1 billion.

Muwonge said the damage to transport infrastructure by the rains and flooding was likely slow the flow of beans from farms and collection centres from some of the deep rural areas.",2020-05-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['drying', 'farmers', 'official', 'crop', 'quality', 'beans', 'million', 'coffee', 'damage', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'mar', 'ugandas', 'heavy', 'told']",Uganda,news article,English

Remember Gulgul, the loyal indie that saved his family from a burglar attack by disarming the robbers putting his own life at risk? Well, another heartwarming canine story comes from Kerala, where the floods have wreaked havoc on people’s lives, killing 37 and forcing 35,000 people into relief camps, according to NDTV.

In Idduki district’s Kanjikuzhy village, Mohanan P and his family were fast asleep in their home, when at 3 am the sound of his dog’s barks woke him up. The man tried ignoring it, but Rocky the dog did not stop.

Instead, he started howling. Recognising this as a distressing, unusual howl, Mr Mohanan realised something was wrong and rushed out of the house.

On exiting the house to check on Rocky, the family immediately noticed the impending disaster. All of them rushed out of the house, just in time, before their home was destroyed by a landslide. The family, including Rocky, have been moved to a government-run relief camp nearby.

You too can be a part of this movement and help us raise funds for the NGOs working to rehabilitate these families. If all of us come together with a small monthly contribution, we can make a real and meaningful difference in helping restore normalcy to those who need our help the most.

Canines are often quicker to spot and react to danger than us, which is what causes them to give off warning or distress signals. In Gujarat, a dog saved his master from being mauled by three lions, when he raised the alarm, attracting a crowd that forced the lions to flee, according to the Times of India.

In yet another heroic incident in Bhubaneshwar, a dog single-handedly killed four poisonous snakes, slithering, trying to sneak into a house, according to Deccan Chronicle.

The courageous dog was trying to kill the snakes, and in the end, even though he was successful, he died because of the multiple snakebites he suffered in the process.

Well, these are just a few of the instances that dogs have saved their humans, often at the cost of their own lives! No wonder they are referred to as “man’s best friends”.

The eighth battalion is based at Govindpuram in Ghaziabad and more teams have been asked to remain on standby.

A major relief and rescue effort is on in Chamoli where a massive flood was triggered in the river Dhauliganga after a glacial burst on Sunday morning. NDRF officials from the eighth battalion said that one of their teams, comprising 40 to 45 members and dog squad, was rushed initially from their regional response centre in Dehradun while the second team departed on Sunday afternoon from Ghaziabad.

“This team was sent by road while three teams were airlifted from the Hindon airbase. In all, five teams were pressed into service and more teams including from the other NDRF battalions have been asked to remain on standby,” said PK Tiwary, commandant of the eighth battalion.

The teams of NDRF are equipped with sophisticated equipment and dog squads which help in search and rescue.

“The teams are equipped with about 310 sophisticated equipment which are used during floods, building collapse and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear emergencies. Since it is a case of flash flood, we will also be using our team of divers and equipment like sonars and boats for detection and rescue. Our teams have also taken relief material for people affected by the incident,” Tiwary added.

The eighth battalion and other NDRF battalions were also a part of search and rescue operations during the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand.

Sunday’s flash flood has endangered the lives of thousands of people living along the riverbanks. There are fears of massive destruction. An alert has also been sounded by authorities in Uttarakhand in several districts including Pauri, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Haridwar and Dehradun.

Teams of the Indo Tibetan Border Police were also rushed to the site near the Raini village.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath tweeted that the UP government is standing with the Uttarakhand government for any help or assistance.

“The situation of water level in areas along the river Ganga is being constantly monitored in the state. In case there is a rise in water levels, people near the banks will be shifted elsewhere as the situation demands. Directions have been issued for relief and rescue,” the chief minister’s office said in a tweet.

The UP police also tweeted, “We are in touch with our counterparts. Border distts. of Uttarakhand have been alerted. NDRF, SDRF & flood company of PAC have been instructed to be on highest alert. Evacuation of people shall be done wherever required.”

With the early arrival of southwest monsoon this year, four Rayalaseema districts recorded excess rainfall in the range of 33% and 85% when compared to the average precipitation for June.

Kurnool district has received 146.4 mm of rain till 8.30 a.m. on July 1, when compared to the normal of 79.1 mm; while Anantapur has received 111.2 mm against the average of 64.7 mm, which amounts to 85.1% and 71.9% excess respectively.

Anantapur recorded 45.5 mm of rain (28.8% deficit) during the monsoon season last year. For the first time, the cumulative average rainfall for the district has crossed 100 mm since 2007, when 150.7 mm of rain was recorded in June, said S. Malleswari Sadhineni, agrometeorologist of Rekulakunta Agriculture Research Station. “The district recorded 169.9 mm rain in 1996, the highest ever in June. The earliest ever above 100 mm average rainfall (105.7 mm) was recorded in 1877,” said the agrometeorologist, adding that this year’s 111.2 mm is the seventh highest ever quantum recorded in history of Anantapur.

The average rainfall in the State for June this year has been put at 120.3 mm, which amounts to excess precipitation by 24.1%.

1394,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt's Sisi ups pressure for Ethiopia dam deal on Sudan visit - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sudan-egypt-idUSKBN2B00JD,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called on Saturday for a binding deal by the summer on the operation of a giant Ethiopian hydropower dam, as he made his first visit to neighbouring Sudan since the 2019 overthrow of Omar al-Bashir.

Egypt also signalled support for Sudan in a dispute with Ethiopia over an area on the border between the two countries where there have recently been armed skirmishes.

Both Egypt and Sudan lie downstream from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Addis Ababa says is crucial to its economic development.

Ethiopia, which says it has every right to use Nile waters long exploited by Egypt, started filling the reservoir behind the dam last summer after Egypt and Sudan failed to secure a legally binding agreement on how the dam will be operated.

Khartoum fears the dam, which lies on the Blue Nile close to the border with Sudan, could increase the risk of flooding and affect the safe operation of its own Nile dams, while water-scarce Egypt fears its supplies from the Nile could be hit.

Years of diplomatic talks over the project have repeatedly stalled. Egypt and Sudan’s positions have drawn closer as Cairo has engaged in a flurry of diplomacy over the issue in the past two years.

This week Egypt’s chief of staff signed a military cooperation agreement with his Sudanese counterpart during a visit to Sudan.

“We affirmed the necessity of returning to serious and effective negotiations with the aim of reaching, as soon as possible and before the next flood season, a just, balanced and legally binding agreement,” Sisi said after meeting Sudan’s leaders.

Sudan recently proposed that the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union should actively mediate in the dispute, rather than simply observing talks, a suggestion that Egypt supports.

Ethiopia this week indicated its opposition to adding mediators to an existing African Union-led process.

Sisi’s call came a day after Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a return to “serious” negotiations over the dam, according to Egypt’s foreign ministry.

Meeting with the head of Sudan’s ruling council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sisi also discussed “recent Sudanese moves to extend state sovereignty on its eastern borders with Ethiopia, which come within the context of Sudan’s respect for international agreements”, a statement from Egypt’s presidency said.

Sudan and Ethiopia have blamed each other over unrest in the border area of Al-Fashqa, long settled by Ethiopian farmers. Ethiopia has rejected Sudan’s claims to be asserting its rights to control the area under a border agreement from 1903.

The names of the 11 women announced by the director of General Corner’s Office of Fars province are as follow:

Leila Ranjbar; from Shiraz Nilofar Godarzi; from Marvdasht Yasin Haghighat; from Karaj Sanaz Kyani; from Amol Raheleh Taimouri; from Isfahan Laya Narimani; from Isfahan Khadijeh Ibrahimi; from Amol Zahra Aughel Zadeh; from Shiraz Farideh Molodi; from Sa’adat Shahr Atena Sadoghi; from Alborz Roohangiz Moori

It is to be said that due to the New Year holidays many of the victims were visiting Shiraz from other cities.

Ms. Atena Sadoghi lost her life on April 1, at the Namazi Hospital of Shiraz and Ms. Roohangiz Moori passed away on April 2 at the city’s Faghihi Hospital. (The state-run ROKNA News Agency- April 4, 2019)

The agency also reported on April 3, that a 35-year-old woman and a man have lost their lives being buried under the wreckage of a house when it collapsed by flood.

Previous news indicated that 8 women in Shiraz, one in Lorestan, two in Mazandaran, a 20-year-old in Koohdasht of Lorestan, and two girl children in Hamedan and Khuzestan had been killed in the flash floods. This brings the number of women’s death toll during the flood crisis to 18.

By covering up the true number of the casualties and the missing people, the regime is trying to minimize the scale of damages and losses caused by the flood.

On April 3, the regime’s state-run TV citing the Emergency Organization, stated that the casualty toll has been 66 deaths and 478 wounded.

Linkedin Ganug Nugroho Adi (The Jakarta Post) Surakarta, Central Java ● Mon, June 20, 2016

Heavy rains that showered Surakarta, Central Java, from Saturday afternoon through to early Sunday have caused floods that are 50 to 100 centimeters deep in several areas across the city. The flooding, to which the overflowing Bengawan Solo River contributed, has inundated hundreds of houses, forcing more than 2,000 people to take refuge elsewhere.

Three districts, namely Jebres, Pasar Kliwon and Serengan, are the most affected by the flooding and within them the hardest hit areas are Pucangsawit, Sewu, Sangkrah, Semanggi, Kedunglumbu, Joyontakan, Gandekan, and Gulon.

The floodwaters reportedly began to inundate residential neighborhoods at around 8 a.m. local time on Saturday, after which the water levels continued to rise until Sunday afternoon, forcing more residents to relocate. Search and Rescue Agency (SAR) teams were dispatched to assist the residents, especially women, children and the elderly, using rubber boats.

“We’re worried that the floodwater will not yet recede tomorrow [Monday] so it would be better for us to relocate,” said Rubiyah, 55, a Joyotakan resident.

On Sunday evening, hundreds of Joyotakan residents still packed evacuation posts on river dikes and sidewalks and in schoolyards.

Volunteers from the Surakarta Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) and the city’s Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) have set up evacuation tents and dispatched public kitchen vehicles.

“We dispatched the vehicles to several flooded locations. We don’t erect public kitchen tents anymore to serve food to refugees. It’s much more efficient and effective to use public kitchen vehicles to provide the services,” said Surakarta Deputy Mayor Achmad Purnomo when he visited flooded areas in Joyotakan.

PMI Surakarta secretary Sumartono Hadinoto said the humanitarian aid agency had sent food supplies to the flood victims. He said it was predicted the number of evacuees would continue to increase as many residents were still trapped in their houses. The floods also hit Solo Baru, an elite residential neighborhood in Surakarta.

High resolution satellite images have identified the exact spot where a ""dangerous"" lake was formed by the debris of the avalanche that left dozens dead and 200 missing on Sunday. Scientists of the Defence Research and Development Organisation(DRDO), the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and others are working on a plan to avoid another disaster, should water from this lake gush through a breach, NDTV has learnt.

""This matter has been taken cognizance of. As we speak, teams are already on the way to the lake side to assess the situation, take a review. Earlier in the morning, teams have overflown the area in choppers and found out.... Even drones, unmanned flights, stakeholder agencies are doing the review of the exact situation on the ground,"" NDRF Director General SN Pradhan said.

""There's concerted effort to see what's on ground, make an assessment, and follow it up with appropriate action. We're on the job,"" he added.

Choppers have taken videos of this artificial lake, which is thrice the length of a football field.

The satellite images indicate the block on the Rishi Ganga that is fed by the fast-flowing Ronti River. The Rishi Ganga subsequently flows in the direction of the Tapovan Hydel power plant, which was severely damaged by the flash flood and debris from the avalanche on February 7.

A part of a glacier broke off and crashed into the river, picking up boulders, debris and massive amounts of silt as it slid down the Rishi Ganga river sweeping away two hydel plants along its path.

A close-up from Wednesday shows the extent of the water build-up and the wall of debris. The worry is that the weight of the water can pierce the wall, which could lead to another flood.

""We have measured the width and the length of the lake, the wall of debris. That's all coming through, the parameters on which we can act,"" the NDRF chief said.

A Garhwal University Professor, YP Sundrial, who went to the spot to assess the aftermath of the disaster, said the lake formation was worrying.

""Right now I am standing at the confluence of the northeast stream and the Rishganga river. The flood started from the northeast stream. The landslide caused temporary damming and blocked the Rishganga river,"" Professor Sundrial said.

The lake can be breached anytime and can cause more floods, said the expert.

""This can impact rescue work. Rescuers downstream may be in danger, so I am going to try and ensure that the message reaches the administration,"" he said.",2021-02-12 08:00:00+00:00,"['images', 'river', 'ndrf', 'satellite', 'dangerous', 'water', 'lake', 'wall', 'avalanche', 'length', 'debris', 'uttarakhand', 'rishi', 'formed', 'pics']",India,news article,English
838,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Veteran ink artist's mountain of work on display|Life|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-09/08/content_13645698.htm,"Veteran ink artist's mountain of work on display Updated: 2011-09-08 07:57 By Zhu Linyong (China Daily)

Mountains are clearly close to ink artist Ma Jizhong's heart.

The native of Shaanxi province, which is home to the Qinling Range, says, ""I spent my youthful years in mountainous areas, and mountains have become the fountain of my artistic inspiration Actually, mountains are the refuge of my soul.""

He was speaking at the opening of his exhibition that runs through Sept 12 at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing.

Ma's five-decade oeuvre includes caricature, New Year pictures, ink figure paintings, and picture-story illustrations.

But he is best known for miti shanshui (dense landscapes), a less popular genre of Chinese ink landscape paintings, that emerged in the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) and reached its height in the Yuan Dynasty, thanks to master painter Wang Meng (1301-1385).

""The creation of a piece of miti shanshui is not only time-consuming but also technically demanding,"" explains Xue Yongnian, art critic with the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

A typical miti shanshui work often, if not always, is a well-proportioned composition on a huge rice paper scroll. Deftness in Chinese calligraphy is a prerequisite for a miti shanshui painter as the lines, dots and patches of the landscapes are all rendered in calligraphy style. Any completed miti shanshui piece must be done with great care to detail and the overall look should be such that whether viewed from afar or up-close, the painting retains its vivid look, Xue says.

This explains why very few modern painters go down this path, Xue says, pointing out that Huang Qiuyuan (1914-1979), Zhang Ding (1917-2010) and Yang Shanshen (1913-2004) were among the few courageous ones who did.

""My decades-long experience of living and working in the mountains of my home province has convinced me that this genre best suits the natural beauty of the mountains of northern China,"" explains the 70-year-old.

Born into a Catholic family in Feicheng, Shandong province, in 1941, Ma had a tumultuous childhood, defined by wars, natural disasters and abrupt family changes.

""My mother married three times just to keep her five kids alive amid a time of chaos,"" recalls Ma, who moved to Xi'an in the late 1940s where his early interest in painting was encouraged by his primary and middle school teachers.

Ma was first trained in basic Western painting techniques at Xi'an Fine Art Academy from 1958 to 1962. In 1969, he moved to the mountainous areas of Taibai county and worked for the next two decades in a culture center where he trained himself in ink art.

In late 1988, Ma moved back to Xi'an where his unique painting style attracted critical attention.

Although Ma lives in the city, he continues to be drawn to the mountains.

""I feel an invisible bond with the mountains the lush trees, the chirping birds, the gurgling springs, and the simple but healthy life of the local residents, all gladden my heart.

""I will paint the mountains all my life.""

So far, at least 235 people have died or been listed missing after the floods and landslides triggered by storms and heavy rains in central Vietnam last month, the government informed the National Assembly Tuesday.

Among the casualties were 35 military officers and soldiers of two different military teams sent on search and rescue missions after landslides hit several districts in the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri.

The region suffered historic flooding, with the peak time falling between October 12 and 19. Floodwaters inundated the homes of 317,000 families with 1.2 million members from Nghe An to Quang Nam, with many areas being flooded for nearly two weeks.

Over 200,000 houses were seriously damaged. Many public construction projects also suffered heavy damage and roads were heavily eroded.

Of the total damage of VND17 trillion, VND10 trillion ($430.16 million) was caused by Molave, one of the most powerful storms to hit Vietnam, the government said.

The storm made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces on October 28, causing heavy rains and deadly landslides in the central region.

Earlier, the government granted over VND1 trillion, over 11,500 tons of rice and other essential items in relief support for the worst-hit central provinces.

Not over

The government said it would continue to mobilize all forces to search for the victims buried in several landslides and fishermen missing at sea. Among the missing are 12 hydropower plant workers in Thua Thien-Hue Province who were hit by a landslide on October 12, 19 residents in Quang Nam Province hit by two landslides as an impact of Storm Molave last week, and 23 fishermen from Binh Dinh Province whose boats sank in rough sea as the storm was near.

Priority in relief support will be given to those in worst-hit localities and isolated areas and to quickly repairing infrastructure and public construction works damaged by storms and floods, the parliament was told.

The government is also joining forces with local authorities to evacuate residents from high risk areas as storm Goni, the 10th storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, heads towards south-central Vietnam.

International forecasting agencies expect the storm to directly affect the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.

Natural disasters, predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms, killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

Britain's Prince Harry will party in Las Vegas while training in the US.

The 26-year-old royal - who is renowned for a love of nights out - will spend 48-hours in the gambling city while undertaking a 12-week helicopter training course in California and Arizona later this year, as it is part of the ""tradition"" for those taking part.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: ""It's traditional that guys on his course, which is split between California and Arizona, have a break in Vegas at the halfway point.

""The course doesn't have much downtime, it's pretty intense. This is a chance for pilots to let their hair down, kick back and enjoy themselves.""

As part of his US training, Harry - who was recently promoted to a Royal Air Force Captain - will learn how to use weapons systems on board a helicopter and take part in mock combat missions with American forces.

He will also be taught techniques which will help him avoid surface-to-air missiles.

1403,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"Tropical Storm Beta makes landfall, brings flooding to Texas - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent",https://egyptindependent.com/tropical-storm-beta-makes-landfall-brings-flooding-to-texas/,"HOUSTON (AP) — Storm surge and rainfall combined Tuesday to bring more flooding along the Texas coast after Tropical Storm Beta made landfall, threatening areas that have already seen their share of damaging weather during a busy hurricane season.

The storm made landfall late Monday just north of Port O’Connor, Texas. Early Tuesday, Beta was 35 miles (56 kilometers) north northwest of the city with maximum winds of 40 mph (64 kph), the US National Hurricane Center said. The storm was moving toward the northwest near three mph (four kilometers) and is expected to stall inland over Texas.

“We currently have both storm surge and rainfall going on right now,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Amaryllis Cotto in Galveston, Texas.

Cotto said 6-12 inches (15-30 centimeters) of rain has fallen in the area, with isolated amounts of up to 18 inches (45 centimeters). Dangerous flash flooding is expected through Wednesday, Cotto said.

Beta was the ninth named storm that made landfall in the continental US this year. That tied a record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. It also was the first time a Greek letter named storm made landfall in the continental US Forecasters ran out of traditional storm names on Friday, forcing the use of the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s.

Beta will move inland over southeastern Texas through Wednesday and then over Louisiana and Mississippi on Wednesday night through Friday, and the biggest unknown from Beta was how much rainfall it could produce. Beta was expected to weaken into a depression, but flash flooding was possible in Arkansas and Mississippi as the system moves farther inland.

Earlier predictions of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) in some areas were downgraded Monday to up to 15 inches (38 centimeters).

Forecasters and officials reassured residents Beta was not expected to be another Hurricane Harvey or Tropical Storm Imelda. Harvey in 2017 dumped more than 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rain on Houston, causing $125 billion in damage in Texas. Imelda, which hit Southeast Texas last year, was one of the wettest cyclones on record.

Storm surge up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast from Port Aransas to Sabine Pass in Texas. In Galveston, an island city southeast of Houston, there was already some street flooding Monday from rising tides and part of a popular fishing pier collapsed due to strong waves.

Farther south on the Texas coast, Maria Serrano Culpepper along with her two daughters and dogs left their home in Magnolia Beach near Matagorda Bay on Sunday night.

Culpepper said she didn’t want to be trapped in her home, three blocks from the beach, with wind, rain and possibly no electricity. She and her family evacuated to a friend’s home in nearby Victoria.

Culpepper said her home should be fine as it’s on stilts 13 feet (4 meters) off the ground and was built to withstand strong storms.

“I’m feeling OK now. I had two nights without sleeping because I was worried about (Beta) being a Category 1 hurricane. I calmed down when the storm lost power,” said Culpepper, who works as an engineer at a nearby chemical plant.

On Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 29 Texas counties ahead of Beta’s arrival.

Beta is forecast to dump heavy rain on the southwestern corner of Louisiana three weeks after the same area got pounded by Hurricane Laura. The rainfall and storm surge prompted Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards to declare a state of emergency.

In Lake Charles, Mayor Nic Hunter worried about Beta’s rainfall could set back efforts in his Louisiana community to recover after Laura, which damaged about 95% of the city’s 30,000 structures. Hunter said the worry of another storm was “an emotional and mental toll for a lot of our citizens.”

Parts of the Alabama coast and Florida Panhandle were still reeling from Hurricane Sally, which roared ashore Wednesday, causing at least two deaths. Two Boston-based disaster modeling firms figured Sally caused about $2 billion in privately insured losses from wind and storm surge. Karen Clark & Company estimated losses at $2 billion, while AIR Worldwide said they were between $1 and $3 billion. The estimates don’t include uninsured losses, the National Flood Insurance Program claims or damage to offshore property, like oil rigs.

Hurricane Teddy was about 295 miles (475 kilometers) northeast of Bermuda Monday night as it heads toward Nova Scotia. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 kph) while moving north at 25 mph (40 kph) and away from the wealthy British territory, according to the US National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was expected to weaken and become a strong post-tropical cyclone before reaching Nova Scotia on Wednesday.

The government closed all air and sea ports, schools and government offices for the second time in a week. Hurricane Paulette made landfall in Bermuda on Sept. 14, knocking down trees and leaving thousands without power.

The rains that fell overnight left flood-prone areas submerged, with emergency services concerned over the fate of people living near river banks and on riparian areas.

The Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) had over the weekend warned of heavy downpour in the city that will continue throughout the week.

A forecast of the rainfall situation by the weatherman indicated that there would be heavy rainfall in the Nairobi region, central Kenya and parts of the eastern region from Saturday.

""Showers and thunderstorms are expected over most places on Saturday night, while rains are expected during the week followed by a thunderstorm,"" KMD said.

Warning

Director of Meteorological Services Stella Aura, in the statement, called for measures to be put in place to avoid loss of life and property during the rains.

Ms Aura has warned Kenyans, including motorists and pedestrians, to be on the lookout and be cautious while passing through moving water.

""It's going to rain heavy tonight. Everyone using the roads either as a driver or pedestrian is advised to observe extra caution. Avoid passing through moving waters. Keep safe.""

On Monday morning, along Mombasa Road, near Imara Daima estate, motorists were forced to use only one lane with access to several offices completely cut-off by the raging water.

Some blamed the situation on the ongoing construction of the Nairobi expressway, saying contractors are spilling rainwater from their site onto the road.

Others blamed the perennial flooding challenge on poor drainage in the area.

Mark Lukale said that the road from Garden estate to Windsor ""is now a big river. From Ruaka to Ndenderu is a nightmare. These roads need a 4x4. Balaa tupu na hii mvua.""

National governments and UNOCHA estimate more than 1.5 million people have been directly affected by sustained, above-average seasonal rains across the region in July and August. Floods have affected Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia, and parts of Somalia, Kenya, and Uganda. The floods have also led to significant crop damage and property loss.

Outside of the worst-affected areas, the seasonal rains are generally beneficial for agricultural production in crop-producing zones in the northern and western sector. Additionally, water sources are fully replenished, and the water levels of many lakes, rivers, and dams are at historic levels.

Rangeland conditions broadly remain favorable. In the Horn, recent August rainfall helped slow the decline of pasture availability and surface water pans that usually occurs in the July-September dry season.

1467,FL-2020-000164-IND,Monsoon season is coming: How could that impact you? - KOAA.com Colorado Springs and Pueblo News,https://www.koaa.com/news/covering-colorado/monsoon-season-is-coming-how-will-that-affect-you,"If you're new to Colorado, you might start to hear the term ""monsoon"" thrown around.

What is a monsoon?

Lars Leber Photography

When people think of a monsoon, they usually mistake it with a typhoon or some other variation of a huge rainstorm.

In reality, a monsoon is simply a seasonal wind pattern that sweeps moisture into the desert southwest. The North American Monsoon is seasonal because it only happens during the summer months.

KOAA Weather

During July and August, the hottest months of the year, a strong high-pressure system can set up above and east of the four corners region.

At the same time, intense daytime heating in the desert southwest can produce a low-pressure system often referred to as a monsoon low.

KOAA Weather

Moist air from the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and even evaporating plants in the Sierra Madres will rotate north between these two pressure systems.

It's this constant north moving air mass that leads to the North American Monsoon.

Monsoons are famous for bringing heavy rain and scattered, unpredictable thunderstorms to the southern Rockies and desert southwest.

How does it affect southern Colorado?

Daniel Forster

While not as directly affected as Arizona, southern Colorado will usually see at least some effect of a monsoon every year.

Typically during a monsoon pattern in Colorado, we see near-daily thunderstorms develop over the mountains and push east into the plains through the afternoon.

Storms will often start over the mountains between 12 and 2 p.m., drift east into the larger towns on I-25 between 1 and 4 p.m., and move east through the plains in the early evening.

KOAA Weather

Since monsoon season develops over the summer months, most cities along the Front Range tend to see their wettest months in July and August.

Monsoon fueled thunderstorms tend to be frequent, numerous, and often come with heavy rain. This is critical to fighting fire danger by keeping our grassy and forest fuels saturated.

Does a monsoon bring more hail?

While monsoon fueled thunderstorms can easily produce hail, Colorado tends to see the most severe hail reports a month before monsoon season.

KOAA Weather

This graph shows the number of severe hail reports (1 inch or greater in size) for all areas east of the Front Range from 1997.

On top of heat and moisture, June tends to see a more active jet stream which results in a severe weather ingredient called wind shear.

July tends to come in as the second most active month for severe hail, with one of the major factors being an increased number of monsoon-driven thunderstorms. The more storms, the better the chance one or two can drop large hail.

KOAA Weather

The same trend is seen through El Paso County. June is our most likely month for severe hail, with July as our second most likely month.

Monsoon patterns typically come with a lack of wind shear, which makes it difficult for thunderstorms to stay strong to severe.

Because of this, while hail is certainly a worry for storms in monsoon season, flash flooding is often a much more common severe threat.

Do I need to prepare for monsoon season?

Larry Marr

Unless you live in a flood-prone area, the only people who need to prepare for monsoon season are avid campers and hikers.

Monsoon fueled thunderstorms tend to form over the mountains between 12 and 2 p.m. These storms grow quickly and can bring heavy rain, strong winds, and lots of lightning.

Larry Marr Thunderstorm in Calhan captured by Larry Marr

Be sure to check the forecast and try to get any big hikes started early, that way you can be off the mountain or at least below treeline in the early afternoon before storms develop.

On days with elevated severe storm risks, try and find covered parking at work or in a parking garage to keep your car safe from hail.

The 28-year-old’s extension to his current deal will run to the summer of 2019 and makes Silva the third player to agree an improved offer after Samir Nasri and Aleksander Kolarov.

“From the moment I joined the club four years ago it has felt like a second home to me,” the Spain midfielder said. “On and off the pitch, I feel incredibly content and fulfilled professionally and personally, so why wouldn’t I want to stay and keep winning trophies with this fantastic team?”

Silva joined City from Valencia in 2010 and proved an instant hit, winning three consecutive player of the month awards between October and December that year before helping the club end their 35-year trophy drought with the FA Cup final win over Stoke City.

He played in all three of Spain’s World Cup group games in Brazil and now has his sights set on the Premier League season.

Silva said: “Over the last four years, we have achieved so much together, establishing City as a dominating force in England and now, when I look around this dressing room, I can see no reason why we won’t become one of the top teams in the world.

“It was a straightforward decision to extend my stay here and spend my peak years at Manchester City, a club with unbelievable fans who have always supported me.”",2014-08-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['manchester', 'contract', 'wouldnt', 'stay', 'signs', 'cup', 'silva', 'club', 'fiveyear', 'winning', 'david', 'city', 'player', 'joined']",China,news article,English
1551,FL-2021-000021-IND,"Breakage of Hanging Glacier May Have Triggered Uttarakhand Disaster, Preliminary Observations Indicate | The Weather Channel - Articles from The Weather Channel | weather.com - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/en-IN/india/news/news/2021-02-11-breaking-of-hanging-glacier-may-have-triggered-uttarakhand-disaster,"Uttarakhand disaster (IANS)

There was a hanging glacier that slipped with rock and ice falling from 5,600 metres altitude owing to gravitational pull and this caused disaster in Uttarakhand, as per preliminary observations of experts.

This explanation by scientists comes days after Home Minister Amit Shah told Parliament that initial inquiry has revealed that a landslide triggered a snow avalanche covering approximately 14 square km area and caused a flash flood in the Rishiganga river downstream in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district.

The scientists, however, say it is difficult to comment right now if climate change has been directly responsible for the February 7 catastrophic that washed away two upcoming hydropower stations, claiming at least 34 dead and 200 missing who are feared dead.

Explaining what caused the flash flood, Mohd. Farooq Azam, who is an Assistant Professor at IIT Indore, told IANS in an interview that the Nanda Devi glacier did not burst.

""There is no terminology in science like 'glacier burst'. But we believe that there was a hanging glacier which slipped with rock and ice falling from 5,600 metres altitude,"" he said.

""To understand if the incident was climate change-driven or not, we need to understand how glaciers grow. They have a pattern of snow and melt in winter and summer seasons respectively. This is a normal phenomenon. Now, this was a hanging glacier. It is possible that the glacier also collected mass and debris over a period of time.

""We cannot say with confidence right now if climate change had a role to play, but it is possible that the strength of the mass was weakened due to climate-driven factors,"" he explained.

Azam said a team of scientists are at the site in Chamoli district trying to understand what caused this disaster.

""It is early February so temperatures in the area are low and not much melting would be happening right now which could've led to this. ""So far the only explanation is that a hanging glacier cracked due to gravitational pull and the weight of the accumulated mass, which resulted in this avalanche.

""However, there is no doubt that global warming is impacting the local climate of the region. The Himalayas are experiencing warmer winters, erratic and extreme rain and snow, more than ever before. These changes are leaving their imprint on the region,"" said the glaciologist.

""But the mystery which scientists are looking for answers for is what is the source of the water we saw in videos on February 7. Some water will be generated from the heat energy of the fall, but that does not justify the quantum that hit Raini village.""

This disaster is a grim reminder of the 2013 flash floods and landslides in Uttarakhand that claimed the lives of thousands of people and animals. Of course, the effects of such an event can be mitigated by some early warning systems, Azam told IANS.

Advertisement ""When there is a glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) or flash flood, the only solution is that is an early warning system which can warn communities and authorities to prepare to evacuate people living in these areas.

""Secondly, exposed glacier lakes have the potential to burst and lead to such disasters. But it is possible to pump out water from these lakes. This has been done in Peru and Nepal, where water levels in such glacier lakes are reduced to safe zones to mitigate disaster risks.""

On the need to review the policy on 'water grab' dams that put fragile Himalayan ecology in peril, he replied, ""Yes, although not 100 per cent sure how climate change effects are being taken into account when environmental impact assessments are done on these dams and other infrastructure projects.""

""Natural disasters or climate change-induced disasters can harm these infrastructures, so there needs to be better planning for such projects and a review of the present situation of all dams. This lesson should be learnt after this tragedy,"" he said.

Observing climate change is increasing, Mandira Shreshtha, programme coordinator, HI-RISK Initiative with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), said: ""It is evident that climate change is increasing the occurrence of extreme events in the region.""

""Hydrometeorological monitoring is very important. However, the network density in higher elevations in our Himalayan region is poor and much lower than those recommended by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). To monitor the changes occurring, we need to strengthen our hydrometeorological networks.

""Satellite data and information in real-time provides some opportunities, however, it has its limitations. In addition to strengthening our monitoring networks there is a need for risk assessments and increasing awareness of the communities living downstream to minimise the adverse impacts of such disasters,"" said Shreshtha.

The science behind what is currently happening in the Himalayas was forecasted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2019 report that said glaciers would retreat in the upcoming years, causing landslides and floods.

Himalayan glaciers play an important role in South Asia, providing drinking water and water resources for agriculture, hydropower and biodiversity. Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region are a crucial water supply for the 240 million people who live in the region, including 86 million Indians, roughly the equivalent of the country's five biggest cities combined.

Another comprehensive report two years ago, the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment, coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) notes that eastern Himalaya glaciers have tended to shrink faster than those in central and western Himalaya.

Communities face serious health risks living in appalling conditions. Flies and mosquitos are everywhere. Getting by is a daily struggle. People walk long distances in search of fresh waterthe alternative is to drink from the dirty water along the roadside that children play in. Many do just that.

Women bathe their children in the same water they wash clothes in. Limited supplies of clean water are strictly rationed.

Many farmers lost their cattle in the floods. Some built makeshift shelters for the animals and shared whatever clean water they could spare with them.

For some towns and villages, such as the ones in Mirpurkhas district, we had to travel by motorboat to reach the area. Villagers there told us that they hadnt seen any outsiders ever since the floods devastated their homes and that all their crops were now gone and possessions lost; no more houses, and nothing to eat.

Milan, Inter & Serie A all winners after dramatic derby draw at spectacular San Siro

The two sides were scrapping for sixth place in Serie A but the pair's performances suggested both have bright futures under their new owners

COMMENT

A sold-out San Siro, an estimated television audience of 862 million, two talented teams playing at full pelt and a fittingly dramatic finish - the first ever 'Chinese Derby' was, in every sense, a spectacular success.

The game was drawn but, to the neutral, this looked like a victory for both sides - and, perhaps more importantly, Italian football as a whole. It has been too long since one of the most prestigious fixtures in football could be called a major event and this was, lest we forget, a San Siro showdown between two sides scrapping for sixth place in Serie A.

Milan earn dramatic derby draw with Inter

However, Milan's fans celebrated Cristian Zapata's 96th-minute equaliser like they had won an eighth European Cup, while their Inter counterparts were left disconsolate. This mattered to them. More importantly, it felt like it finally mattered again to football fans across the globe.

It might not look like it right now for the Nerazzurri but this was the kind of match that these two clubs needed. The world was watching, intrigued by the prospect by these old rivals being reinvigorated by new money, and the pair produced an exhilarating spectacle, from start to finish.

Indeed, both sets of players seemed determined to put on a show worthy of the incredible coreografie that had preceded the kick-off.

The Curva Sud had channelled the spirit of Robin Hood, declaring, ""For us bandits, you are unwelcome guests."" It was Inter, though, who looked more like canny thieves, with the 'hosts' nicking a goal against the run of play in the 36th minute.

Mattia De Sciglio may have been to blame for losing the flight of the ball but there was so much to admire in the way in which Roberto Gagliardini picked out the run of Antonio Candreva with a lofted, 40-metre pass from halfway - while the winger's hooked finish over the advancing Gigio Donnarumma wasn't too shabby either.

The goal understandably rocked the Rossoneri, who had earlier struck the woodwork through the electric Gerard Deulofeu, and Inter took full advantage, doubling their advantage with another splendidly-worked strike.

Mauro Icardi had come into the derby without a goal in his previous three Serie A outings but he ended his mini-drought in fine style, chesting Ivan Perisic's pass back into the winger's path before then racing into the area to side-foot home the resulting cross.

Ronaldo reps slam 'disgusting' rape claim

The two combined wonderfully well all afternoon and really should have produced another goal 10 minutes into the second half when Icardi found Perisic with a perfectly-weighted ball across the Milan box only for the Croatian to shoot tamely at Donnarumma.

It proved a pivotal moment in an enthralling contest as Milan - inspired by Deulofeu, the game's outstanding player - never stopped attacking and deservedly halved their deficit when Alessio Romagnoli impressively stabbed home a Suso cross with just seven minutes remaining to set up the grandstand finish that the game, and indeed the occasion, merited.

The Rossoneri looked to have run out of time as the clock ticked past the allotted five minutes of injury time but they were afforded one last corner by referee Daniele Orsato. Incredibly, they made it count, with Manuel Locatelli flicking Deulofeu's corner into the path of Zapata, who drove the ball over the line - via the cross bar - despite the best efforts of Gary Medel.

BVB considered pulling out of CL

Milan were as joyous as Inter were crestfallen but both sides should take a huge amount of encouragement out of a high-quality encounter. Vincenzo Montella's Milan are only going to get better - particularly with the addition of some quality, experienced signings this summer. Indeed, it is worth pointing out that, over the course of the game, they fielded eight players aged 24 or under.

The Derby also underlined the massive improvement in Inter's fortunes since Stefano Pioli replaced the disastrous Frank de Boer at the helm. This makes it four games without a win for the Nerazzurri, with Icardi admitting just after the full-time whistle that he and his team-mates were ""sickened"" by the result.

However, at times, they again looked like the coming force they appeared to be in matching Juventus in the Derby d'Italia earlier this year and the big-name players that they are presently being linked with suggests that they, too, have a bright future ahead of them.

Zapata enthused afterwards, ""It was a very intense derby, both teams played well and in the end the draw was a fair result. We’re on the right track.""

He may as well have been speaking for both sides. Yonghong Li had claimed beforehand that Milan's new owners, just like the Suning Group, are primarily focused taking small steps on the road to recovery. However, just making the Derby a major event again felt like a pretty big one - for everyone involved.",2017-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['inter', 'derby', 'sides', 'winners', 'san', 'run', 'draw', 'milan', 'fireworks', 'goal', 'looked', 'serie', 'dramatic', 'spectacular', 'siro', 'players']",Ghana,news article,English
511,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Africa's Peace and Security: The Pressures of COVID-19 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/africa-s-peace-and-security-pressures-covid-19,"I would like to thank Off-The-Record for inviting the International Crisis Group to address its members.

The International Crisis Group is an independent organisation working to prevent wars and shape policies that will build a more peaceful world. Crisis Group aspires to be the pre-eminent organisation providing independent analysis and advice on how to prevent, resolve or better manage deadly conflict.

Over a year after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, the dramatic numbers of infections and deaths that some observers predicted for the African continent have yet to emerge. As of 4 May, the global COVID-19 death toll stands at an estimated 3,217.281, among which -- accurate reporting remains a challenge -- Africa has recorded 82,259. The relatively low number of virus-related deaths on the continent, whichever of many possible factors are driving it, provides a sense that Africa is resilient. Polishing this positive image is the fact that almost all countries, except Benin, Burundi and Tanzania, took vigorous isolation measures when the outbreak started, responding much quicker than Europe and the United States, and consequently averting much of the devastation the disease has wrought there.

All this good news could turn bad, however. Caseloads are on the rise and have been since January 2021. The spread of a new variant in South Africa is raising alarm -- it is the worst-affected country with the highest death rate (54,511), but it has a better testing regime and public health strategy than most African states. Meanwhile, an economic storm is gathering due to virus-related restrictions on movement of people and goods. What the pandemic means for a continent whose population is growing at 2.7 per cent a year -- if national GDPs cannot match that fast growth -- is unclear. More concerning is what it means for Africa's fragile or conflict-affected societies.

In March 2020, Crisis Group began examining the pandemic's long- and short-term consequences for deadly conflict. We assessed the potential for COVID-19 to cause enormous damage to fragile states and trigger unrest. We judged that COVID-19's reach, its impact on public health, the economic downturn it would precipitate and the social disruptions it would leave in its wake would shape conflicts and crises around the world. We argued that women, children, refugees, the internally displaced and citizens of countries suffering from crisis mismanagement would bear the brunt of the pandemic's knock-on effects.

A year on, the jury is still out on the pandemic's impact on international peace and security.

A year on, the jury is still out on the pandemic's impact on international peace and security. COVID-19 has been a complicating factor in various war zones, but conflict resolution has fared no worse than before; indeed, conflict prevention and resolution were struggling before the pandemic. Globally, the pandemic worsened relations between the U.S. and China and dented multilateralism, but those trends were already notable before the virus spread. Whether things will improve with a new U.S. president is unclear, but thankfully Joe Biden has signalled a return to a broad approach to international cooperation.

In Africa, the pandemic has neither altered nor worsened the conflict landscape, but it has often proven distracting. The need to contain the pandemic threw off course the African Union's (AU) work on ""Silencing the Guns"" -- an ambitious goal to end conflicts on the continent by 2020. The organisation has extended this project's deadline by ten years. The AU was right, of course, to pivot to address the pandemic and it responded effectively. Led initially by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- an institution created in 2017 as a result of lessons learnt from West Africa's Ebola crisis in 2014-2015 -- the AU reacted swiftly, establishing the Africa Task Force for Novel Coronavirus with its CDC and the WHO, guidelines and standards for government responses and helping distribute test kits and protective equipment. The AU and CDC are now playing a major role in rolling out vaccines to the AU's 55 member states.

In Africa -- like elsewhere -- the pandemic gave great advantage to strongmen who sought to further tighten their grip.

A year ago, we wondered whether various national leaders would exploit COVID-19 for political purposes. In Africa -- like elsewhere -- the pandemic gave great advantage to strongmen who sought to further tighten their grip. Leaders in Angola, Burundi -- Pierre Nkurunziza, who led the country for fifteen years and died a month after stepping down from office, from what many speculate was COVID-19 -- Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe used pandemic regulations as an excuse to further close the political space and enforce social distancing rules through heavy-handed security forces. In the lead-up to Uganda's presidential election in January 2021, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights accused authorities of enforcing COVID-19 restrictions ""more strictly to curtail opposition electoral campaign activities in a discriminatory fashion"". Diplomats from seven Western countries warned Zimbabwe in late August not to use COVID-19 as an excuse to restrict citizens' fundamental rights.

Nor can one ignore the situation in Tanzania, which was led by a president who denied the pandemic's very presence. He, too, died recently in murky circumstances. Assuming the cause of death was COVID-19, the virus has completely altered Tanzania's political landscape by ushering the country's first female president into office who also appears more willing to contain the pandemic.

But even Africa's more democratic-leaning governments (eg, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa) have seen instances of police using unnecessary force to enforce lockdown rules, though a recently released survey showed South Africans were prepared to sacrifice certain rights to stop the spread of COVID-19, and that black South Africans seemed the most willing in that regard among the country's different population groups.

At its start, the pandemic looked like it would prove to be a particular threat to countries facing political turbulence or delicate transitions. It additionally looked like it would worsen major crises on the continent. Indeed, COVID-19's arrival may have been a complicating factor in some instances, though things were hardly great before it arrived.

Take Ethiopia, for example, one of the continent's major powers. The country is at war in its Tigray region in a contest between Nobel Laureate Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the former ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) party. Prime Minister Abiy's decision to delay elections slated for August 2020 and focus on the pandemic was the right move. Yet he made it with insufficient sensitivity to opposition concerns.He instituted a state of emergency, but then delayed the polls indefinitely amid the opposition's complaints that the government was using the pandemic to cling to power. The TPLF organised regional elections, despite the federal decision to postpone polls due to COVID-19, arguing that the constitution did not permit such delays. This decision in turn led to confrontation with the federal authorities.

The pandemic likely exacerbated tensions and may have accelerated confrontation between Tigray and the federal government, but both were already beating the war drums. Since 4 November, fighting between federal and allied forces (neighbouring Eritrea's troops and Ethiopian Amhara militias), on one side, and Tigray forces, on the other, has resulted in thousands of deaths. It has also displaced up to a million people internally, according to Ethiopian authorities, and sent more than 60,000 others fleeing as refugees into neighbouring Sudan, which is facing its own delicate transition following the April 2019 ouster of President Omar al-Bashir. There are increasing reports of ethnic cleansing, rape and potential crimes against humanity, as well as numerous other human rights violations. Up to 4.5 million people in Tigray, a region of only 6 million, are in acute need of emergency food supplies. Outside pressure prompted the federal government to promise humanitarian agencies access to Tigray, which may lead to more relief into areas under its control.

The pressure the pandemic might have imposed on Africa's warring parties to stop fighting turned out to be strikingly low.

Meanwhile, the pressure the pandemic might have imposed on Africa's warring parties to stop fighting turned out to be strikingly low. Initially, some armed groups heeded UN Secretary-General António Guterres's 23 March 2020 call for a global ceasefire. In Africa, there were offers of cooperation and endorsements by some groups in the Central African Republic and Cameroon, as well as announcements of unilateral ceasefires by the government and most armed groups in Sudan. But globally, the ceasefire call lost momentum. The more potent jihadist fighters in Nigeria's north east and the Lake Chad basin, as well as the Sahel, never embraced the call and continued to fight.

The same is true of Somalia's Islamist Al-Shabaab insurgency. It has oscillated in its COVID-19 response, sometimes displaying pragmatism while blaming outsiders for the pandemic. It labelled COVID-19 as a problem exported to Somalia by ""crusader forces who have invaded the country"", referring to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) troops in the country. But the group has undertaken local measures to prevent the pandemic's spread, probably to avoid the disastrous repercussions it suffered when it refused outside humanitarian assistance during the 2011 famine, which contributed to the loss of 260,000 lives. Al-Shabaab has also rejected the AstraZeneca vaccine. It may fear that the government would capitalise on the vaccination campaign by providing a service that the insurgents could not match. It may also have been loath to allow populations to travel to government-controlled areas, or government actors to enter its areas, which would have posed a security risk from the group's perspective. Curiously, however, Al-Shabaab has left the door open for other ""safe and effective"" vaccines.

COVID-19 also did not deter insurgents from escalating their fight with government forces in Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province. The region has been restive since 2017, and the U.S. recently sanctioned the insurgency, designating it an Islamic State (ISIS) affiliate. Before the arrival of COVID-19, the country was already grappling with multiple health crises, including outbreaks of cholera and malaria, and was in need of humanitarian assistance due to climatic shocks linked to several years of drought, cyclones and floods.

As for peace processes, the pandemic neither enabled nor blocked them, though it did slow down mediation efforts and fulfilment of peace deals in some countries.

As for peace processes, the pandemic neither enabled nor blocked them, though it did slow down mediation efforts and fulfilment of peace deals in some countries. Take South Sudan, for example, a country celebrating its tenth anniversary of independence from Sudan, eight years of which have seen it fighting a civil war. The pandemic may have slowed down, for several months, implementation of the 2018 peace deal that brings the country's main warring parties into a ceasefire and unity government. Several of the country's five vice presidents contracted the virus and government was focused on responding to the health crisis. But the peace process was not moving that fast to begin with.

The pandemic appeared to hinder efforts to resume peace talks between the government and Thomas Cirillo's holdout rebellion in Equatoria after both sides agreed to a cessation of hostilities in Rome in January 2020. Coronavirus travel restrictions and the limits of virtual diplomacy undercut mediation. But other salient factors undermined the talks, which only resumed in October. The Rome ceasefire was breached in April. It is not clear who broke it, but President Salva Kiir used it to launch major offensives in Central and Western Equatoria, further undermining Cirillo's trust in the process. He already rejects the main 2018 peace deal on the grounds that it does not address his people's grievances, including the push for greater decentralisation. The project of ending rebellion in Equatoria requires both sides to abide by commitments they made to respect a ceasefire.

COVID did aggravate peace operations in some of Africa's conflicts. Troop rotation was initially halted for AMISOM in 2020 but has since resumed. The UN mission to South Sudan (UNMISS) restricted its troop rotations and undertook patrolling and other peacekeeping activities only cautiously. The pandemic complicated external interventions in the Sahel, which were forced to adapt, hibernate or freeze activities. It disrupted the UN mission in Mali (MINUSMA), the EU missions and the deployment of Operation Takuba, established by European states to reinforce French efforts and support the Malian army in its fight with jihadists. It also slowed development initiatives by introducing new restrictions on meetings and travel; staff had to work remotely. Meanwhile, development projects faced similar restrictions and donors had to suspend some projects or redirect, for good reasons, part of their funding to help stop the virus' spread and underwrite the Malian health ministry's COVID-19 action plan.

Overall, however, amid the dramatic transformations that COVID-19 has wrought, much remains unchanged for peace and security on the continent. The virus cannot be blamed for lack of progress in addressing a number of pressing conflicts. We need to guard against the risk of ascribing problems to COVID-19 -- a narrative that if pushed too far could distort analysis, let actors off the hook and lead to erroneous policies.

Where we do need to remain attentive is the pandemic's economic fallout for the continent. Efforts to counter COVID-19 could reduce the funds available for bilateral and multilateral organisations to deal with the crises that may result. The strongest example of the former is the UK's aid cuts of £4.1bn for 2021, amounting to a 25 per cent reduction. Some of Africa's international partners may lack the bandwidth, funds or appetite to focus on the continent, given the depth of their own crises brought about by COVID-19. Urgent measures are thus necessary to relieve the pandemic's economic distress in fragile or conflict-affected societies. Global economic factors have tended to contribute to conflict risks in many countries, a trend that the pandemic could aggravate. The economic jolts resulting from the pandemic are worrying and will leave a number of the poorest countries in the world facing the prospect of five to ten years of depressed development.

The economic jolts resulting from the pandemic are worrying and will leave a number of the poorest countries in the world facing the prospect of five to ten years of depressed development.

For Africa, the future looks ominous. After South Asia, Africa is the continent with the biggest population projected to plunge into extreme poverty, with around 495 million -- 70 per cent of the world's poor people -- expected to be still living in those conditions by 2030. Worryingly, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa Vera Songwe notes: ""Africa's buffers in 2021 are thinner than pre-pandemic"". A long bout with the coronavirus will be damaging for the continent's youthful and fast-growing population. COVID-19 is testing not just Africa's poorest countries but also its biggest economies. It has further aggravated Nigeria's youth unemployment. The latest figure of nearly fourteen million out of work may have motivated the government to finally roll out its long-awaited special works program for the young. As for South Africa, while it appears to be recovering from COVID-19's economic fallout, unemployment rates and inequality are rising there as well.

International efforts to help African states mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic may not be enough. The G20 countries agreed this month to extend initial suspension of debt service payments from June 2021 for another six months to December 2021 for more than 40 of the poorest countries -- including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. But this relief is only temporary and it will not solve the continent's critical debt problem in the long run. More than 30 per cent of revenue for a number of African governments is directed at debt repayments. The recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank spring meetings put the spotlight on managing divergent recovery both among and within states, but given the growing disparities and inequalities, wealthy countries should ""take the long view and act boldly to forgive the debts of poor countries and expand emergency financial assistance"". President Biden's decision to reverse Trump-era opposition to increasing the allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) -- a form of supplementary monetary reserve -- from its last expansion after the 2008 global financial crisis is a major boost to developing countries. The new $650 billion agreed to with other G7 nations may help poor countries cope with the pandemic's economic shocks, particularly if rich countries channel excess SDRs to poorer ones.

Ensuring that Africa has equitable access to vaccines will also be crucial to the continent's economic recovery.

Ensuring that Africa has equitable access to vaccines will also be crucial to the continent's economic recovery. The challenge of vaccinating people in Africa's most fragile states or those in conflict will complicate rollout plans. Poor logistics, negligible storage infrastructure and underfunded health-care facilities will disrupt those efforts. The continent is also at the periphery of the global scramble for supplies of COVID-19 vaccines and has almost no vaccine manufacturing capability. Its efforts to inoculate its citizens will largely depend on international good-will. Hence, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access -- COVAX facility -- a global mechanism funded by donors to help guarantee access to vaccines, especially for poor and lower-middle-income countries, is important for Africa.

The AU secured 670 million vaccine doses at the start of 2021. The head of Africa's CDC, John Nkengasong, wants to vaccinate up to 60 per cent of the population by 2022; other more conservative estimates don't expect most people to have been inoculated until at least mid-2023. With the initial slow pace of vaccine supply from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca -- the latter is widely available through COVAX, but halted in many countries due to safety issues -- African states have turned to China and Russia to secure reliable vaccines, though recent news suggests that the former's vaccine has proven less effective than alternatives. The race to help Africa inoculate its 1.3 billion citizens has created a vaccine contest, with Ankara, Beijing and Moscow vying with Western partners to strengthen their respective influence in parts of the continent.

Indeed, a number of external powers have seized the opportunity offered by the pandemic to advance soft power diplomacy across the African continent. At the start of the pandemic, China's image on the continent was greatly enhanced when the Jack Ma Foundation sent each African country batches of medical equipment, including thousands of masks and testing kits. Beijing then burnished its credentials by sending additional equipment and donating vaccines to several African countries, including Zimbabwe. By signing up to the G20 efforts to suspend debt payments, China also participated, for the first time, in a multilateral debt relief effort. Turkey has also dispatched thousands of masks along with other medical equipment to 45 African countries, including Niger and Mali. In Sudan, the Gulf states, Turkey and Egypt delivered personal protective equipment with a good amount of publicity, clearly aiming to build the profiles of these countries in Sudan at a time when Khartoum is reconfiguring its foreign policy.

Beyond the dire economic forecasts and concerns about the vaccine's reach, the news is not all bleak. Some of Africa's leaders have moved fast to put in place important social protection measures to help protect jobs, protect the vulnerable and provide some other safety nets.

Can they do more to relieve COVID-19's pressure and to ensure it doesn't worsen the conditions of fragile of conflict-affected societies? The AU has played a central role in managing efforts to limit the contagion's impact. The AU Assembly Bureau, traditionally an administrative body, began to take on a more political role in 2020. Made up of five heads of state, one from each African region, it began meeting on the African response to the pandemic. Under the then AU chair, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, it worked decisively to support the AU Commission and the CDC to launch a number of initiatives.

Crucially, the Bureau appointed six prominent and distinguished Africans as special envoys, including Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria, the newly appointed director-general of the World Trade Organisation, to mobilise financial resources to support national health responses and assist in the recovery of economies. An AU COVID-19 Response Fund was established in March 2020 by the AU Commission chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat. By October 2020, it had raised $44 million and made plans to raise a further $300 million. The African Continental Free Trade Area, which began operating on 1 January 2021, will open up a vast single market that could significantly boost regional trade and offset the economic shock dealt by COVID-19.

Other initiatives included medical supplies platforms to assist AU member states with access to affordable medical supplies and equipment, and technical assistance on case detection and containment. The Africa CDC also rolled out mechanisms to strengthen testing capacity. As noted, it has also led on acquiring vaccines, but it wants to coordinate vaccine trials and explore the potential for vaccine manufacturing on the continent -- it held a two-day meeting on the latter subject on 12-13 April.

AU members need to extend the robust COVID-19 coordination to more effectively respond to the continent's crises at a time when external partners may be reluctant or unable to continue funding the AU at existing levels.

But AU members need to extend the robust COVID-19 coordination to more effectively respond to the continent's crises at a time when external partners may be reluctant or unable to continue funding the AU at existing levels. Given how badly the pandemic has hit the Global North, we should expect Western governments to become more insular and inward-looking. We should expect a deficit of attention and less focus on overseas conflicts that do not impinge upon what Western leaders see as their national interests. South Africa's President Ramaphosa was right to state in his handover note to the Democratic Republic of Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi as AU chair that ""conflict and war on the continent remains a grave threat to our developmental aspirations"". Member states have agreed to monitor implementation of the newly extended roadmap for silencing the guns every two years. The pandemic places tremendous pressure on Africa's leaders to tackle its debilitating effects and they have acted quickly. That same rapid reaction is necessary to address the continent's worse crises.

791,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,"Zimbabwe power blackout hits EcoCash, vulnerable economy - Quartz Africa",https://qz.com/africa/1671195/zimbabwe-power-blackout-hits-ecocash-vulnerable-economy/,"On Saturday morning (Jul. 20) local time Zimbabweans experienced a system blackout on Econet Wireless, the country’s biggest telecoms operator after a significant power outage.

Econet says the network challenges were caused by a fault that started when generators at its operations centre failed to kick in after a Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa) power outage.

But a power cut to Econet’s servers is no mere outage. It is effectively a major disruption to an already troubled economy teetering on the edge as it means 70% of Zimbabweans had no phones, internet and crucially EcoCash mobile money services. More than 14 million subscribers were caught off guard. People were stuck in banking halls, fuel queues, supermarkets and commuters to various places were stranded.

And in what seems like a never-ending cycle of misery for ordinary Zimbabweans in the last year, it is likely there will be more power cuts and ultimately more economic disruption due to the country’s currency troubles and—now, climate change.

Zesa has recently introduced an 18-hour load shedding schedule in most parts of the country because Zimbabwe relies on hydroelectric power from Lake Kariba along the border with Zambia where ongoing drought means water levels have dropped so low it’s forcing reduced electricity production.

In addition, Zesa owes over $50 million to Eskom in South Africa where it also get some of its electricity and the Zimbabwean government has repeatedly stated it doesn’t have enough foreign currency to settle the debt.

As for mobile operators they now have a significant expense as they have to use generators to power their stations but even that challenge is exacerbated because the country is in the middle of a fuel scarcity crisis which is causing prices of diesel to spike.

There are now real fears mobile operators will introduce a system where users in some parts of the country will not be able to access certain services on their networks as it has become too expensive to power up network towers using generators.

Zimbabwe’s economy has been deteriorating since president Emmerson Mnangagwa took over from his mentor Robert Mugabe in November 2017 through a military coup. The finance minister Mthuli Ncube last month scrapped a multi-currency regime and introduced a local currency which has not helped the situation by adding more uncertainty.

While some of the services had been restored eight hours later in the evening, subscribers were still reported to be having difficulties with Ecocash.

Economists see this as a huge blow to the economy as large chunks of the country’s economy runs through runs through electronic systems and mobile money dominated by EcoCash with 95% market share. It’s estimated around 5 million transactions a day more more than $200 million.

1133,FL-2016-000114-EGY,The Vanishing Nile: A Great River Faces a Multitude of Threats - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/vanishing-nile-a-great-river-faces-a-multitude-of-threats-egypt-dam,"The Nile River is under assault on two fronts – a massive dam under construction upstream in Ethiopia and rising sea levels leading to saltwater intrusion downstream. These dual threats now jeopardize the future of a river that is the lifeblood for millions.

Though politicians and the press tend to downplay the idea, environmental degradation is often an underlying cause of international crises — from the deforestation, erosion, and reduced agricultural production that set the stage for the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s to the prolonged drought that pushed rural populations into the cities at the start of the current Syrian civil war. Egypt could become the latest example, its 95 million people the likely victims of a slow motion catastrophe brought on by grand-scale environmental mismanagement. It’s happening now in the Nile River delta, a low-lying region fanning out from Cairo roughly a hundred miles to the sea. About 45 or 50 million people live in the delta, which represents just 2.5 percent of Egypt’s land area. The rest live in the Nile River valley itself, a ribbon of green winding through hundreds of miles of desert sand, representing another 1 percent of the nation’s total land area. Though the delta and the river together were long the source of Egypt’s wealth and greatness, they now face relentless assault from both land and sea. The latest threat is a massive dam scheduled to be completed this year on the headwaters of the Blue Nile, which supplies 59 percent of Egypt’s water. Ethiopia’s national government has largely self-financed the $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), with the promise that it will generate 6,000 megawatts of power. That’s a big deal for Ethiopians, three-quarters of whom now lack access to electricity. The sale of excess electricity to other countries in the region could also bring in $1 billion a year in badly needed foreign exchange revenue. GERD can only begin to meet these promised benefits, however, by holding back river water that would otherwise pass down the Nile to Sudan and then Egypt, and that’s obviously a big deal for both those countries — so much so that, according to Wikileaks, government officials in Cairo at one point talked about aerial bombing or a commando raid to destroy the dam.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is being built on the Ethiopian-Sudanese border on the Blue Nile, which supplies 59 percent of Egypt’s water. Yale Environment 360

The dam will create a reservoir more than twice the size of the Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States. It will ultimately store 74 billion cubic meters of Blue Nile water. (That’s about 64 million acre feet, or the amount of water need to cover 100,000 square miles of land one foot deep.) Filling it could take anywhere from five to 15 years. “During this period of fill,” a new study in the Geological Society of America’s journal GSA Today reports, “the Nile’s fresh water flow to Egypt may be cut by 25 percent, with a loss of a third of the electricity generated by the Aswan High Dam.” That is of course Egypt’s own massive dam on the Nile, completed in 1965, roughly 1,500 miles downstream. The GSA study, led by Smithsonian Institution geologist Jean-Daniel Stanley, says Egypt faces “serious country-wide freshwater and energy shortage by 2025.” Agriculture in the delta, which produces up to 60 percent of Egypt’s food, could also suffer from shortages of irrigation water. The GSA study makes clear, moreover, that the new dam is only one of a series of environmental threats now facing Egypt. Rising sea levels, brought on by climate change, are the most obvious of them. Much of the Nile Delta is only a meter or so above sea level, and a 2014 analysis led by Assuit University geologist Ahmed Sefelnasr predicted that a half-meter rise in sea level would shrink the delta by 19 percent, an area equivalent to all of metropolitan Los Angeles. That was the conservative scenario. If the sea level rises by one meter in this century, as many climate scientists think likely, a third of the delta could disappear under the Mediterranean. That analysis did not consider the likely effects of the significantly greater rise predicted by a 2016 study in Nature.

Egypt is already one of the poorest nations in the world in terms of water availability per capita.

It also ignored the compounding effect of land subsidence in the delta, particularly along the Mediterranean coast. In an interview, the Smithsonian’s Stanley attributed subsidence there to continuing compaction of underlying geological strata and to seismic activity. “The region is considered tectonically stable,” he said. “But it’s not inactive.” Earthquakes of magnitude 5 or greater occur about every 23 years there, and “earthquake events of shallow origin and small magnitude” are frequent. The delta is also subsiding (and becoming less fertile) because it is no longer replenished each year by 100 million tons by flood sediments from the Nile. Instead, those sediments now drop out where the Nile enters the reservoir created by the Aswan High Dam. A new delta is now forming there, but underwater. Other studies have attributed increased seismic activity in the region to the weight of the dam and the water stored behind it. In addition to the almost certain loss of land area in the delta, the combination of sea level rise and land subsidence will also increase saltwater intrusion. Egypt is already one of the poorest nations in the world in terms of water availability per capita; it has just 660 cubic meters of freshwater a year for each resident, compared, for instance, to 9,800 cubic meters in the United States. But according to the Sefelnasr study, saltwater intrusion from a one-meter rise in sea level could jeopardize more than a third of the freshwater volume in the delta. “If you talk to farmers in the northern delta,” said Stanley, “they will tell you they have lost production consistently, and that saline wedge is moving toward the middle of the delta. So it doesn’t look like a very happy thing,” especially with Egypt’s population set to double over the next 50 years.

So how should Egypt, with its struggling economy and recent history of political unrest, address what are plainly life-threatening challenges? Despite the loose talk about destroying the Ethiopian dam, war appears highly unlikely. In 2015, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan signed a mutual do-no-harm agreement, and just this past January, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met in Addis Ababa, on apparently cordial terms, with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. But a formal agreement on exactly how to share Nile resources is still lacking. Ethiopia could minimize the immediate downstream damage by lengthening the time it takes to fill the reservoir. But that means delaying the benefits of the dam, which Ethiopia may already have oversold. The river flow will produce the promised 6,000-megawatt output only during peak periods, according to Asfaw Beyene, a mechanical engineering professor at San Diego State University. He notes that the Italian company building the dam also performed the initial feasibility studies, an obvious conflict of interest because of the potential to inflate costs and profits by installing excess capacity. Beyene calculates that even a 2,000-megawatt rating might have been “a little excessive.” Pressure to get a return on its investments could make Ethiopia less likely to delay. Egypt in any case has little ground for negotiating a favorable deal, said Harry Verhoeven, a professor of African politics at Georgetown University. It has always asserted its right to the lion’s share of Nile River water, formalizing that claim in the 1959 Nile Waters Agreements, with little regard to the needs of upstream countries. Hosni Mubarak compounded that slight during his long reign as Egypt’s president, taking other Nile Basin countries for granted and effectively withdrawing from the rest of Africa. “In that sense, it’s hard to feel sorry for Egypt,” said Verhoefen.

Eight months after the cyclone, Oscar Eugenio is still on the precarious edge of disaster. “Some days we have food,” he says. “And some days we do not.”

His small farm in northern Mozambique was among the thousands destroyed by the two devastating cyclones that hammered the country within the space of a few weeks – an unprecedented phenomenon that has been blamed on climate change.

“We lost everything,” he says. “Our crops were destroyed. Our family grew hungry.”

Now he is among the estimated 45 million people in Southern Africa who will face severe food shortages over the next few months as a result of extreme weather: drought, flooding, fierce storms, late rainfall, rising food prices and other threats.

More than 11 million people are already suffering emergency levels of food shortages in nine Southern African countries, according to data from United Nations food agencies. Many regions of those countries are enduring their worst drought in 35 years, the organizations say.

The crisis in Southern Africa is just one of several emergencies across the continent. Countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan have been hit by the double disaster of drought and flooding. In South Sudan, about 5.5 million people – nearly half of the population – are forecast to be facing hunger and the risk of famine in early 2020 as a result of flooding and drought, UN agencies say.

Southern Africa is going through some of the worst climate shocks on the continent. Severe drought, the second in three years, is hitting much of the region. The drought, combined with hyperinflation and economic mismanagement, has pushed Zimbabwe toward the risk of “man-made starvation,” a UN investigator has warned. Water levels in the Kariba Dam have sunk to such dangerously low levels that Zambia has been forced to impose power cuts. Cattle herds – along with elephants and other wild animals – have been dying in huge numbers in Namibia.

“This year’s drought is unprecedented, causing food shortages on a scale we have never seen here before,” said a statement by Michael Charles, head of the International Red Cross Federation in Southern Africa.

“We are seeing people going two to three days without food, entire herds of livestock wiped out by drought and small-scale farmers with no means to earn money to tide them over a lean season.”

As the drought expands, the link to climate change has become increasingly clear. Southern Africa’s temperatures are rising at twice the global average, the UN says, and the region includes many of the African countries that are considered to be the most vulnerable to climate change. Since 2012, the region has had only two favourable harvests. Rainfall is projected to be below-average over the next three months.

“With the region so prone to shocks and afflicted by high rates of chronic hunger, inequality and structural poverty, climate change is an existential emergency which must be tackled with utmost urgency,” said a statement by Robson Mutandi, the Southern Africa director for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a UN agency.

In Mozambique, one of the countries at greatest risk from climate change, nearly two million people will need food assistance over the next several months, the government says.

Cabo Delgado, the northeastern province of Mozambique, was hit last April by Cyclone Kenneth – the strongest cyclone ever to hit the African continent, with wind gusts of up to 220 kilometres an hour.

But the province is also in the grip of a violent insurgency that has killed hundreds of people and forced about 65,000 people to flee their homes.

“People have the double impact of the armed violence and the cyclone,” said Patricia Danzi, the Africa regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross. “They have to rebuild their lives twice.”

Mr. Eugenio is rebuilding the mud-walled buildings on his farm in Cabo Delgado, but the biggest blow was the loss of his cash crop, sesame, which he would normally sell to generate income for his family. Without any sesame crop, he survives by doing part-time labour on nearby farms, in exchange for a few kilograms of maize and beans.

But it’s not enough. On some days, he and his wife and four children have only cassava to eat, a low-protein food that has to be stretched out over the whole day.

He managed to get a small harvest from a few fields in October, but he can’t even estimate its size. “Every day we had to eat some of it,” he says.

“We haven’t recovered from the cyclone. We are still suffering today.”

These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.

Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.

Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.

The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.

As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing.

In addition, 150,000 people have been evacuated and significant impacts on transportation networks and agricultural livelihoods have been reported.

USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance partner VNRC is on the frontline of the response and has mobilized rapid disaster response teams established and trained through ongoing USAID disaster risk reduction programs to support evacuation, search and rescue, and emergency response operations, said the ambassador.

""We stand together with the government and the people of Vietnam as they mourn their loved ones, address the damage caused by this terrible flood, and move forward, as the people of Vietnam have always done. We pledge to assist you in your work to rebuild,"" he said.

""I would also like to express my concern for persons with disabilities in the provinces affected by the typhoon as they are amongst the most vulnerable populations in this disaster. They are often home-bound, have less access to information and cannot take full advantage of preparedness activities and evacuation protocols,"" he added.

It is estimated that the provinces impacted by storm Linfa are home to over 200,000 persons with disabilities, of whom 61,000 are directly affected by this disaster.

Since 2000, USAID, through the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, has provided over $26 million in disaster response, preparedness, and risk reduction assistance in Vietnam.

Through the Department of Defense, the U.S. government has also provided more than $28 million since 1998 to train military and civilian emergency responders and develop and equip disaster management centers, maritime response centers, and disaster shelters at community level.",2020-10-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['vietnam', 'storm', 'response', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'central', 'aids', 'floods', 'landslide', 'usaid', 'affected', 'linfa', '100000', 'cope', 'provided']",Vietnam,news article,English

The exercise which started as early as 6:00 a.m. saw the residents disilting chocked drains, and cleared bushy surroundings at the Tema station, Osu RE, Angola road, the Social Security and Insurance Trust (SSNIT), Specialist Hospital, the Art centre and the Apollo theatre.

Businesses remained closed till after 12noon as directed by the assembly.

At the Tema station, the hawkers had finished sweeping as at 7:00a.m. while the men among them including the various drivers unions helped the Assembly staff dredge the chocked drains.

The Municipal Environmental Officer of the Assembly, Mr Victor Acquaye, told the Ghanaian Times that the infant Municipality was always the first point of call for any visitor in Accra, hence the motivation to keep it tidy.

According to him the president's vision to make Accra the neatest capital city in Africa would be a mirage if residents did not help in cleaning the mess they caused.

Mr Acquaye explained that keeping a healthy environment was a shared responsibility that was why all business activities were halted so that everyone could partake in the exercise.

""The slightest flood would seriously derail the economic gains by the government and the assembly which is less than a year old,"" he said.

He stated that the assembly were responsible for supplying tools of the exercise with the residents made to understand that it was their duty to help clean up their communities and the idea paid off.

Mr Acquaye said letters would be sent to every area and those who refused to participate in the exercise would be fined and if they failed to pay the fine, they would be dragged to courts.

The officer stated that the next concentration would be at the markets to ensure foodstuffs were sold under hygienic conditions, adding that the assembly would undertake periodic checks to sustain the exercise.",2019-07-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['residents', 'clean', 'assembly', 'help', 'klottey', 'acquaye', 'officer', 'environment', 'station', 'exercise', 'stated', 'municipal', 'korle', 'ghana', 'tema']",Ghana,news article,English

At least 100 people have died and nearly 260,000 have been displaced by flooding in Kenya this month, the Kenyan Red Cross announced Thursday.

Kenyan authorities and humanitarian organizations have been working to airlift stranded residents to safety and provide aid to isolated communities after weeks of heavy rain and landslides.

The flooding comes as many continue to recover from the severe drought in 2017 that threatened millions of people across East Africa.

â??This is a double tragedy for many communities,â? Abbas Gullet, secretary general of the Kenya Red Cross Society, said in a statement. â??These people are strong, and they have already overcome so much adversity. But there is only so much a person can take, and Iâ??m worried that these floods will push some people beyond the brink.â?

The extreme weather has also affected thousands in neighboring Somalia. The United Nations estimated that nearly 500,000 people have been impacted and close to 175,000 displaced from their homes.

â??Internally displaced people remain the most vulnerable to the impact of the flooding with many camps located in low-lying areas,â? StÃ©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN secretary-general, told reporters this week.

â??Humanitarian partners on the ground have prioritized water, sanitation, hygiene, shelter and food response in their interventions,â? Dujarric added.

Disease outbreaks feared

The flooding has also raised concerns that malaria and cholera outbreaks will worsen.

â??There are already active cholera outbreaks in five of the counties affected by floods,â? said Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-TraorÃ©, regional director for Africa at the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). â??We fear that these outbreaks could worsen and spread.â?

Key infrastructure and dozens of health centers have been destroyed, exacerbating the health crisis, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. The flooding has also contaminated a number of water sources.

295,FF-2016-000062-IDN,China: New Bank's Projects Should Respect Rights - Human Rights Watch,https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/24/china-new-banks-projects-should-respect-rights,"(New York) – The China-founded Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) should create a robust, independent accountability body to investigate rights abuses linked to its projects, Human Rights Watch said today. The AIIB, established in June 2015, convenes its first annual general meeting in Beijing on June 25-26, 2016. It is set to approve a new round of projects at the meeting.

Click to expand Image A security guard stands in front of the signboard of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) at its headquarter building in Beijing January 17, 2016. © 2016 Reuters

The AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and Operating Policies note the need to address the bank’s environmental and social impacts and to establish an oversight mechanism to ensure “transparency, openness, independence, and accountability.” The bank’s environmental and social framework emphasizes its aim, through the projects it finances, to encourage respect for human rights. However, the AIIB’s safeguard policies do not require the bank to identify and address human rights risks in the projects it finances, which is necessary for the bank to realize this vision, Human Rights Watch said. Nor has the bank publicly addressed whether it will consult with nongovernmental groups, particularly in countries hostile to independent monitors.



“The AIIB has a chance to get right what other development banks have repeatedly gotten wrong by ensuring that its operations won’t undermine human rights,” said Jessica Evans, senior international financial institutions advocate at Human Rights Watch. “To achieve that, the bank will need to identify and address human rights risks linked to its projects.”



The AIIB, whose first loans have already been announced, intends to fund infrastructure development across Asia. China is its founder and largest shareholder. Other members include Australia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. About a dozen of the bank’s member countries regularly express concerns about China’s human rights record and about abuses linked to economic development projects.



Human Rights Watch research on development banks globally has documented forced evictions, violations of indigenous peoples’ rights, reprisals against critics, and discrimination in the distribution of aid.

The AIIB has a chance to get right what other development banks have repeatedly gotten wrong by ensuring that its operations won’t undermine human rights. To achieve that, the bank will need to identify and address human rights risks linked to its projects. Jessica Evans Senior Researcher/Advocate for International Financial Institutions

Human Rights Watch expressed its concerns about transparency, accountability, and engaging civil society in two letters to the bank’s leadership in August 2015, noting China’s weak track record on transparency and rights-respecting development processes. No replies have been received. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly expressed concerns about the deteriorating human rights environment in China under President Xi Jinping.



“China’s poor record on participation of independent groups and on peaceful criticism means that other bank member countries will need to press the bank to address rights concerns,” Evans said.



The bank has made a commitment to establish an oversight body in line with principles of transparency, openness, independence, and accountability. The body should be able to investigate, report, and recommend remedies for rights abuses linked to its projects, as well as violations of bank safeguard policies. Bank members should ensure that this body’s policies and practices reflects lessons learned by accountability mechanisms at other international financial institutions, including by:

Ensuring it can function independently of pressure from AIIB management and political influence;

Including representatives of nongovernmental groups on the selection committee for members of the mechanism;

Requiring the bank to develop responsive, time-bound plans to respond to rights abuses and findings that it has not complied with its own policies; and

Providing the mechanism with the mandate to monitor and publicly report on whether rights abuses and policy violations have been remedied.

The AIIB should not approve any more projects until its accountability mechanism is up and running, Human Rights Watch said.



“Without strong commitments to respecting human rights in all AIIB activities and a meaningful mechanism to hold the bank to account, this new lender may do more harm than good,” Evans said. “But if all members insist on higher standards, it could raise the bar globally for sustainable, rights-respecting development.”",2016-06-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['banks', 'accountability', 'watch', 'human', 'china', 'rights', 'policies', 'projects', 'bank', 'development', 'aiib', 'respect']",India,news article,English

At least 70 villages in Golestan and more than 200 in Mazandaran are inundated. Aqqala is the worst hit where landslides have killed two people, director general of Golestan province's crisis management department Mojtaba Jamali said.

High water has forced evacuations of several small farm communities as all farmland has been swamped, according to local reports.

Footage from both provinces showed massive flows of water running over roads and streets, with cars being washed away, people struggling to walk, and traffic being disrupted.

577,Drought Sri Lanka,Repayment and Relief: Addressing microfinance debt in Sri Lanka - Groundviews,https://groundviews.org/2019/04/10/repayment-and-relief-addressing-microfinance-debt-in-sri-lanka/,"Nadaraja Devakrishnan stumbled on the gravity of the microfinance debt issue purely by chance. He was attempting to begin community gardening in a small village, to respond to rising cases of CKDu in the district. On returning to check the progress of cultivation, he found none, as all the people had been physically and monetarily drained trying to pay back their microfinance loans. Through the People’s Movement for Community Awareness, he has been grappling with the predatory practices of microfinance companies on villagers in Vavuniya for the last few years.

“The way the microfinance companies are treating people is as much a violation of human rights as enforced disappearances, or things done to people under the Prevention of Terrorism Act” he says to a group of women who have come together to share their struggles, and to think of ways to respond to agents of these companies, who harass them for repayment.

“In the immediate aftermath of the war, there were about 3 or 4 microfinance companies working in the North, but after the government changed in 2015, there are about 34 operating now, including companies run by prominent politicians.”

Cascading loans and predatory repayment tactics

As of March 28 2019, around 170 people are reported to have taken their own lives after being unable to meet debt repayments. In 2018 alone, 15 people in Vavuniya and 55 people around the Province have taken their own lives as a direct result of this crippling debt, says Devakrishnan. He works with several women whose lives have been altered by these companies, and details the immense pressure placed on them for repayment. “They come and harass the women in the house, ask them to sleep with them, take away possessions from the home, and refuse to leave unless they are given the money.”

*Meenakumari and her husband wanted to build a grinding mill, much like the one he had worked in as a child, to operate as a source of income. After a few years of seeking support from microfinance companies to support this dream, she now has ten loans to her name.

“Berendina, Ceylinco Leasing Company, Vision Fund Lanka, LOLC, Commercial Leasing, Kanrich, MBSL, Nation Lanka and HNB Grameen”, she counts off on her fingers.

Her first loan, for Rs. 50,000, was from Berendina, and she paid a monthly instalment of Rs. 4,800 for one year. In order to complete the next phase of their building, they took a loan of Rs. 100,000, paying Rs. 4,600 weekly. Their current loan, from HNB Grameen, is for Rs. 200,000, with a weekly payment of Rs. 3,900 due. It is this loan that has sent Meenakumari and her husband spiralling into debt.

The grinding mill brings in only a limited income of around Rs. 5,000 a month. The price of goods produced at home is higher than those of mass-produced spices and flour that people can buy at a store. For this reason, they are forced to price their goods lower, and this severely impacts their ability to repay their loans.

They took two more loans to settle the borrowing of Rs. 200,000. However they find the largest chunk of their money goes towards settling what are called ‘metre loans’. These are informal agreements with the credit agent,that requires a daily interest payment. Meenakumari has a total of 7 metre loans that she is now paying off.

*Madhavi is the mother of two young girls. One day, her neighbour left their house to hide, fearing a credit agent who was due to collect a payment. The agent refused to believe Madhavi’s explanation that the person was in hospital, and loitered around the house. Madhavi was then forced to ask some money from the nearby shop and pay the agent on behalf of her neighbour.

Her house now functions as a loan centre for Vision Fund Lanka, set up by the company to operate locally within small villages. From here, they give out and accept applications, take payments and supply information. There is no written acknowledgement however that Madhavi’s house is being used for this purpose. She acts as the loan centre leader, again a role that has no written confirmation. When asked what happens if people borrowing through her centre are unable to repay, she says “the leader has to find the money and pay the agent, somehow”.

Sajee, who acts a centre leader in her village, says that the agents do supply a lot of information to borrowers. They explain forms, interest and repayment to the villagers clearly. While there is a policy that loans need to be income-generating, the agent never checks on this, to account for the strain on the borrower if this is not so.

She lists the documents necessary to obtain a loan. Copies of one’s NIC and for women, a copy of one’s husband’s NIC, a family card, issued by the local grama sevaka, and a note of income and expense. There are some issues with these documents. Family cards are not regularly updated, and might not account for any children born since the time of issuance. Since the income is a self-declaration, and requires no certification, people often increase the value to better their chances of getting a loan, but also distorting the agent’s perception of their ability to repay the loan.

They are required to send all this in an envelope with a Rs. 50 stamp. Also required is a signed copy of a slip, provided by the agent that can be produced in court if they cannot repay the loan. The information is filled in by the agent should the need arise. Alarmingly, the women note that they sign on a blank document when submitting it.

*Shanthini, who has taken loans through the centre Sajee leads, says that the agent does not keep track of individual loans, and the strain placed on them by multiple companies. “Unless we’ve taken loans from a particular agent before, the rest of our loans don’t register on any of the records. Many people do not disclose this to lenders as they apply for new loans either.”

She explains the schemes for loans from Vision Fund Lanka, a subsidiary of World Vision. An education loan of Rs. 15,000 can be paid in December, to prepare for the child’s new year in school. Rs. 150,000, with a monthly interest payment of Rs. 54,000, is the value of a housing loan. Finally, their ‘Saviya’ loans give Rs. 100,000 to individuals wanting to start small businesses in their homes. Monthly payments for each of these loans are Rs. 15,000, Rs. 8,600 and Rs. 7350 respectively.

If an agents thinks that a particular borrower is able to make regular repayments of their loan, they extend their housing loan to as high as Rs. 500,000. However, if a borrower signs on to this extension, they allow the agent to take the deed or permit of their house as collateral for non-repayment.

LOLC has a similar policy, where personal loans of Rs. 500,000 must carry signatures of two guarantors who are government servants, and require house documents as collateral. Lawyer Lakmali Hemachandra, who is working on relief for these women, notes that this is possibly just a tactic of intimidation. “Given that a lot of the land in the North, after release, is state land, residents would only have a permit. Permits cannot be transferred between individuals, so it is unsure what they plan to do when the deed is surrendered, or if they can do anything with the land. It’s probably just to make people more fearful and dependent on their support.”

The women say there are people who have left the country to escape being choked by these loans. Due to the harassment and threats meted out by agents, it falls on others to pay what is left. The prevailing drought has compounded the uncertainty and strain on these individuals and their families – it impacts the gains that could be made from agriculture. Existing employment options are limited, and loans do little to alleviate the burden.

Community and legal relief

Community organisations are doing their best to provide some relief for the people. This begins with debt mediation boards, where a compromise is reached to reduce the loan amount. Prashan, leader of a Rural Development Society, says that he refused loan agents entry into the village one day, so they would not harass people who could not pay that month. In some villages, men have even physically chased away agents, running after them as they attempt to approach the houses of those struggling with repayment.

Attorney-at-Law Radika Gunaratne is representing several women across the North-Central province in courts, as they file cases against predatory microfinance companies. ‘’Cases should ideally be dealt with at the district courts, but police intervene before legal action is even taken, threatening people to pay. They know where to visit them at home because the companies openly share their details with the police’’. Gunaratne says the cost of such a case, if it is eventually taken to court, once again only serves to trap the person with more expenditure on legal fees.

“The people need a two year grace period” Devakrishnan says “no loans taken, no repayments made, just time to revive the economy and make some money.”

Debt relief programmes and their effectiveness

In July 2018, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera presented a paper in Cabinet that proposed to write off loans less than Rs. 100,000 for communities in the North. In addition, the Central Bank proposed to set a cap of 35% on interest rates on these loans. While hailed for their attempts in addressing a crippling issue, there is some hesitation as to the full impact of these measures.

Ministry of Finance officials noted to Groundviews that the 35% cap is only applicable to those firms in the formal economy, and it is those in the informal economy who are inflating borrowing costs with high interest rates. They claim that a rate cap of below 35% is likely to push the formal players out of the industry, creating more space for the informal sector that charges high interest rates from borrowers.

“In my opinion, the debt relief and regulatory measures are not enough to address the debt problem the women are facing”; economist Niyanthini Kadirgamar has a range of reasons to claim so. This begins with the fact that the interest rate cap comes into effect only if companies sign a voluntary Memorandum Of Understanding. Even if they were to comply with the standards therein, then the 35% interest rate cap is still too high. The companies are raking in profits while these women and their families face hardships. “These loans are obtained by very poor women for small self-employment efforts; there is no way they can earn enough incomes to pay off such high interest rates” Kadirgamar says.

Currently, the Government’s debt relief program targets only those who have defaulted payments for three months. Kadirgamar says that this doesn’t take into account the fact that many women somehow try to pay off the loan, often resorting to extreme measures to do so, such as skipping meals for children, selling their land, or taking another loan. The women pay their monthly dues due to pressure and aggressive collection practices adopted by the companies. “I know of women who have gone into hiding to escape the debt collectors”, Kadirgamar says, stressing that the reality is very different from what these companies tend to advertise about microfinance – ‘poverty alleviation’ and ‘women’s empowerment’ are words that have no depth in the way microfinance is affecting families across the Northern province.

She suggests that an effective strategy would be a complete write-off of all the predatory loans. Poor women should not be made to pay unfair interest on their small loans. The UN expert on foreign debt also highlighted that human rights standards must be upheld with micro-credit lending. A moratorium of at least two years would also be helpful for drought-affected areas, until they are able to revive their livelihoods.

The officials claim that debt write-off is not a sustainable policy, and that these debt relief operations were targeted for women especially vulnerable due to the ongoing drought. Comprehensive legislation that will protect consumers, and regulate the steps that microfinance institutions can take to collect repayments, is necessary, and is presently being drafted.

Provisions for relief in the 2019 Budget

The 2019 Budget proposed the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme as an avenue to relieving these individuals from the debt trap. These concessionary loans are primarily for those engaged in the agricultural sector, with no collateral needed to be eligible for it. While the Ministry states the rates are much less than those offered by a microfinance institution, it is nevertheless offering more loans as a remedy for issues that loans have caused.

The Ministry believes that since these loans are given to invest in revenue generating activities, chances are that in the medium- to long-term, households would be able to create sustainable avenues of income that can be used to pay-off previous debt. However, this assumption must be considered alongside the fact that the North, Eastern and North-Central provinces have accounted for the lowest GDP by province in the years 2016 and 2017. In addition, the agricultural sector accounts for the lowest percentage of economic activity in these three provinces. As discussed above, individuals might take loans for cottage industries or agricultural work that does not always generate a high income, and could once again serve to affect repayment. Whether this strategy as it stands will actually translate into sustainable income for the individuals, given the structures and opportunities currently in place in these regions, will only play out in the years ahead.

The Ministry notes that financial literacy is being accelerated by the Central Bank, to educate possible borrowers on the risks of taking loans from the informal sector. However, there is a long road ahead in ensuring that microfinance becomes a sustainable tool to improve lives of the individuals who take these loans, many of whom constitute the most vulnerable segments of the population. Framed as legislation for consumer protection, the new act could result in more responsible lending practices and also lay out consequences for companies or agents who do not adhere to these. If new loans do not act as a solution to the individuals who have suffered deeply as a result of old ones, then it is necessary for moving toward alternative models – such as cooperative credit schemes, as Kadirgamar suggests – that are developed based on what is most beneficial for the community and individuals who need it most.

TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The heavy downpours and massive flooding in most parts of Iran's southwestern province of Khuzestan have reached an alarming level.

Volume of major water reservoirs and rivers have critically increased, causing the authorities to evacuate more residential areas adjacent to the dams and rivers.

The water volume in Karun, Iran's major river, has increased to an alarming level of 3,200 cubic meters per second, local media reported Tuesday.

Besides, Karkheh Dam, a large multi-purpose dam built on the Karkheh River, has been filled to the maximum level of its capacity, said Gholamreza Shariati, governor of Khuzestan.

Habitats in the towns of Soosangerd, Bostan and Hamidiya and some villages are at the risk of facing river overflows and dam outpours.

Women, children and the elderly in those areas have been relocated despite some resistance to leave homes.

Shariati has said the young men can stay in their towns or villages to help the rescue and relief operators protect their homes and cities against the floods.

The unprecedented rains over the past weeks in the province have damaged the infrastructures, including the roads and bridges, and incurred millions of U.S. dollars of losses to the agricultural sector.

At least 70 people have been killed and hundreds of others injured since intense rains started to hit some 21 provinces in the north, west and southwest of Iran three weeks ago.",2019-04-10 00:00:00+00:00,"['xinhua', 'flooding', 'dam', 'downpours', 'southwestern', 'reach', 'level', 'province', 'river', 'weeks', 'alarming', 'irans', 'khuzestan']",Iran,news article,English

KOLKATA: Cops in Bengal have deleted more than 500 fake posts of “post-poll violence in Bengal” and “Hindu genocide in Bengal” in the last 96 hours but the numbers are just one indicator of the enormity of the problem. The fakes have become much more “international”: among images sought to be passed off as “Bengal violence images” are old photos from Brazil , Venezuela and Bangladesh .On Sunday, the CID tweeted a video link where a verified user — Chaudhary Amit Singh — claimed a man was beaten and assaulted with sticks and stones.The video had originated from Brazil, and is at least three years old, the CID said. Also, a 2018 video from Venezuela has been shared on social media as a political worker being lynched in Bengal in post-poll violence by “TMC goons”. Kolkata Police has flagged a Bangladeshi video that was being passed off as an attack on a polling agent in Bengal. After this, half a dozen videos have surfaced with morphed images from incidents which took place in Bangladesh, sources said.Since May 5, when police units across the state began monitoring fake news, the number of fake videos under surveillance is stated to be in the hundreds.The CID has contacted social media companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and have taken down close to 300 posts and accounts. The Kolkata Police claimed on Sunday that it had flagged and removed 200 others.Investigators say there has been special emphasis on a few districts, from where the volumes are higher. The state police have lodged five FIRs in Cooch Behar alone. Four people have been arrested. Another arrest took place at Howrah. TOI had reported that CID had arrested two persons from Deganga and Sonarpur earlier. CID sources said most of the rehashed old incidents are those that were reported from UP, Bihar and Odisha.“We have lodged five separate FIRs at Cooch Behar and arrested four persons for sharing fake news that was promoting enmity.

Power-hungry. Unsophisticated. And now - two additions: Crass and Heartless.Water. That's all that Bhaiyya Deshmukh, a poor farmer from Solapur - one of the worst drought-hit districts in Maharashtra - was demanding, sitting on his nearly two-month long protest at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. But Mr Pawar thought it was fine to ridicule and mock a demand that not only Mr Deshmukh but millions of Maharashtrians are making. The same hapless citizens who have lost their crops and have been forced to beg for water as the state struggles to tackle what's claimed to be the ""worst drought since 1972"". ( Watch So where does this ""I-am-King-you-are-Slave"" attitude spring from? Feared by most and disliked by many within his own party, junior Pawar has largely himself and his brash style of politics to blame. Those close to him claim, his ""no-nonsense"" temperament and frankness are misinterpreted as ""arrogance"". But his propaganda team tom-toms this brashness as an asset, comparing him with Raj Thackeray. (The irony is that the masses love it too. Remember Bal Thackeray? His speeches were laced with the choicest of Marathi-abuses.)Others insist, intoxicated by power, the 53-year-old, no longer enjoys an easy relationship with his uncle, the super-shrewd Sharad Pawar. No wonder he also doesn't get along with Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan or even many of the senior members of his own party, the NCP.As Ajit Pawar nurses his political dreams, what he fears most is the 'shame' of failure. It was largely under his leadership that Rs 70,000 crores were spent on irrigation projects which yielded little relief from the acute water scarcity. The media, activists and the opposition all screamed of a scam and he resigned from his post only to be re-instated after a farcical white paper ""cleared"" him. He also holds the Finance portfolio and the state today is reeling under a staggering debt which is nearing Rs 3 lakh crores.This ugly new ""crude"" tag will stick to the man, but despite this current outrage and his failures, Mr Pawar will get re-elected in 2014. And he knows that. We chose the man we really deserve.But just a reminder: to have some finesse in speech, to be able to converse also in English, to have a genuine interest in arts and culture and a mind refined enough for intellectual debates, are not qualities the electorate are hoping to see in our politicians. Anyway, Ajit Pawar does not really aspire to all of the above.If senior Pawar once dreamed of being India's Prime Minister, junior Pawar fancies himself as the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra.Back at the rally, the neta raises the pitch.""I have also come to know that since there is a shortage of electricity, the population is increasing.

1947,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Widespread Floods Devastate Large Sections of East Africa - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/africa/widespread-floods-devastate-large-sections-east-africa,"JOHANNESBURG - In recent months, unpredictable, intense floods have washed across parts of Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti and Tanzania, ruining homes and livelihoods as people and governments try to battle a global pandemic.

As the world battles a pandemic, large swaths of the African continent have been —literally — submerged by floods.

Since March, this crisis has left more than 400 people dead in East Africa. A separate round of flooding has hit West Africa’s Sahel region.

In Uganda, Catholic Relief services estimates that as many as 580,000 people are affected.

Country director Niek de Goeij says ""It's kind of affecting all kinds of people. You know, in Kampala, our capital city, it affects people who have nice houses on the lakeshore. But if you are in the Mount Elgon area, on the border with Kenya; or you're in the Kasese area, on the border with the D.R. Congo, and you’re a smallholder farmer normally benefits from farming on a river bank. And suddenly there’s this raging flash floods that comes down to hills and mountains because of this very intense rainfall — you know, you lose everything. You lose your house, you lose your land. And so it's a very diverse group of people that is affected.”

In the eastern town of Jinja, along the shores of Lake Victoria, radio host and environmental activist John Hillary says flooding doesn’t just destroy homes it ruins the very fabric that holds society together.

“The public hospital, the only public hospital in the Chilembwe region, was completely destroyed. So people as a result of the floods got sick. But they could not get anywhere else to go to because the hospital had been destroyed,” he said.

De Goeij says heavy rainfall is normal in East Africa — what isn’t, he says, is their frequency and intensity. And, he says, the pandemic makes it harder for groups like his to respond.

“It's like a triple crisis in Uganda, right? We have the locusts, we have all the floods. And then, on top of everything else, we have COVID-19. And so it's been, for the affected people, it’s been an especially hard year, you know, to be on a lockdown and be affected by floods, and then because of the lockdown, accessing the support and the relief that that they're entitled to,” he said.

Hillary, who speaks often about climate change on his radio show, says that to him and other activists, this is personal.

“My mom is a gardener. My grandparents, and many people in my family, are farmers. That's what I've known,"" he said. ""Growing up, I always went with my mom to the garden to dig, and we ate food from the gardens. Over time, we have noticed that, because of what I think is negligence, we have been involved in practices that have completely destroyed our rain cycle, our climate is deteriorating every other day.

1196,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Here's How the United States Can Help Iran's Flood Recovery — Bourse & Bazaar - Bourse & Bazaar,https://www.bourseandbazaar.com/articles/2019/4/4/heres-how-the-united-states-can-help-irans-flood-recovery,"Over the last two weeks, Iran has been ravaged by unprecedented floods, resulting in over 60 deaths and the devastation of whole communities. The natural disaster has only added to the the country’s woes, already reeling from an economic crisis brought about in part by the reimposition of the Trump administration’s decision to reimpose secondary sanctions in November 2018. The coincidence of tightening sanctions and a major natural disaster has led for calls for the Trump administration to take steps to ensure that sanctions policies do not unduly interfere with relief efforts. In the aftermath of the 2003 Bam Earthquake, the Bush administration established new licenses to ensure that the program of then-expanding US sanctions would not stymie relief efforts in Iran, which even came to include the dispatch of American search-and-rescue teams. In 2012, the Obama administration took similar steps to ensure financial aid could reach Iran in the aftermath of yet more devastating earthquakes.

So far, the Trump administration has given no indication that it intends issue new licenses to provide legal clarity to those individuals and organizations wishing to provide aid or to support relief efforts in Iran. A brief statement from Secretary of State Pompeo declared that the US “stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief.” However, in an indication of the depth of the Trump administration’s sympathies, Pompeo also claimed that “it is the [Iranian regime’s] mismanagement that has led to this disaster.”

Given the administration’s commitment to imposing “maximum pressure” on Iran through an ever-expanding sanctions program, it is highly unlikely that the administration will prove willing to make it easier for American or foreign entities to provide substantial material or financial relief for the recent floods. However, despite the Trump administration’s regrettable political stance, there are still measures that administration should take—with encouragement from Congress—to ensure that Iran is able to more effectively recover from the floods, in particular by enabling preparedness efforts in advance of the next major natural disaster.

Iran, like all countries worldwide, is facing new and growing challenges related to both climate change and natural disasters. In addressing these challenges, proactive measures of preparation, prediction, and prevention will always have a greater bearing on the protection of human life and mitigation of destruction than the provision of financial aid for relief efforts in the aftermath of a disaster. But in order to succeed in boosting national preparedness for frequent earthquakes, floods, sandstorms, and heat-waves, Iran urgently needs to upgrade its surveying and monitoring technologies to better model and predict meteorological, hydrological, and geological events.

Acquisition of these technologies has been made significantly more difficult by the recent reimposition of US secondary sanctions, meaning that even if Iran takes on board the difficult lessons of the recent floods, it will be hampered in its ability to adapt. The Trump administration should create a new general license to permit the sale of such surveying and monitoring technologies, which produce nothing more than useful information that can be used to save lives. Over the last decade, Iran has undertaken several systematic reviews of its climate change and disaster readiness. In each instance, the acquisition of better technology has been identified as key a priority for authorities.

In December 2017, Iran submitted its “Third National Communication” to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a major report which detailed the country’s assessment of the challenges posed by climate change and the status of its preparedness and remediation efforts. The report, compiled by Iran’s Department of Environment in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, offers a sober assessment of the Iran’s failures to adequately deal with the effects of climate change—failures which stem largely from weak regulations and mismanagement. But the report also highlights how “years of economic instability and unfair sanctions have delayed mitigation and adaptation measures.” In particular, the report notes that “this situation even has prevented civil technologies transfer to Iran, which has constrained mitigation measures and actions.”

As part of the its national communication report, Iran also submitted a separate “Technological Needs Assessment.” Focused largely on technologies that would help increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions, the report also details ways in which Iran has struggled to acquire the survey and monitoring technology necessary to understand and adapt to new climate change phenomena. New technology is needed to identify “the emerging environmental phenomena and challenges such as desertification, drought, sand and dust storms… and mainstreaming environmental considerations in future national development plans.” Notably, the report also details that “climate change causes inconsistencies in historical and data series obtained from the meteorological and hydrometric monitoring stations,” a reference to the fact that Iran is seeing more unprecedented weather events. Today, Iran’s dams are nearly at capacity after historic rainfall, offering a real world example “of greater inaccuracies in estimating water return period for designing and construction of hydrostructures.”

Beyond climate change, a similar emphasis on the need to improve monitoring technologies can be seen in Iran’s official assessments of disaster readiness. Iran’s 2013 assessment report for disaster readiness, complained in accordance with the United Nation’s Hyogo Framework for Action, identified “neither comprehensive nor substantial” achievement in regards to the availability of “national and local risk assessments based on hazard data and vulnerability information.” The report’s authors point to a wide range of issues preventing effective monitoring for natural disaster risks and providing adequate warnings to the population. These challenges include a lack of satellite imagery and the software to interpret that imagery, a lack of a robust climatological models to develop seasonal forecasts, and a lack of tools to predict the severity of complex weather phenomena while they are developing. Pointing to the dual threats of earthquakes and weather-related disasters, the report notes that sanctions are “a serious hindrance in the increase of seismic monitoring instruments and upgrading early warning systems.”

The lack of sophisticated meteorological tools can also contribute to the loss of life even when there is no full-blown natural disaster. In February 2018, an Aseman Airlines ATR 72-212 aircraft crashed in Iran’s Zagros Mountains, killing all 66 people on board. The interim investigation report released last month by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization concludes that the accident was mainly the result of “human factors,” including the actions of the cockpit crew. However, the accident transpired as the aircraft entered adverse weather conditions and the investigators have concluded that contributing factors included a lack of “significant meteorological information” about the wind conditions in the mountain area. This oversight was identified in part because data provided by Météo-France, the French national meteorological association, was more accurate in modeling the wind and ice formation conditions at the time of the accident than the data available to Iran’s own meteorological agency. The report recommends that the Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organization undertake efforts to research how it can provide more sophisticated information on mountain weather hazards, something which will require new monitoring technologies.

Multiple agencies in Iran, looking at issues of climate change, disaster management, and aviation safety, have formally detailed the need for more advanced survey and monitoring technologies. They have also identified sanctions as a major impediment to the acquisition of these technologies. It is a common claim that Iranian authorities point to sanctions to deflect away from their own mismanagement. However, in regards to climate change and disaster management efforts, sanctions-related challenges have consistently been described by authorities as just one of many challenges, most of which stem for domestic failures of best-practice adoption. Additionally, the effect of sanctions on Iran’s ability to acquire these much needed surveying and monitoring technologies is readily observed in the relevant trade data.

A general license issued by US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control would drastically increase the ease with which suppliers of meteorological, geological, and hydrological monitoring equipment could determine the compliance of sales to Iranian customers. Such a license would benefit US companies as there is precedent for sales of such equipment to Iran. In 2007 and 2008, before US secondary sanctions on Iran were expanded, with just under USD 8,000 dollars worth of “surveying instruments and appliances,” specifically exported in 2007 and just under USD 80,000 exported in 2008, according to trade data from the US Census Bureau.

But more importantly, a general license would significantly impact the ability of European companies, including the European subsidiaries of American companies, to export meteorological, geological, and hydrological survey and monitoring instruments to Iran. Europe is by far the largest exporter of such technology to Iran, but it’s exports have been significantly impacted by US secondary sanctions.

A review of European exports to Iran since 2000 makes it clear that the vast majority of “hydrographic, oceanographic, hydrological, meteorological or geophysical instruments” (HS code 9015) were purchased by Iran prior to 2009, meaning that much of the technology Iran has deployed is at least a decade old. The imposition of international sanctions on Iran saw exports in these categories fall precipitously, with totals falling from a high of over EUR 16 million in 2006 to just over EUR 375,000 in 2014. A small recovery can be observed in 2016, when Iran received sanctions relief following the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but the limited recovery tallied suggests that the lingering impact of US sanctions on banking channels and the anticipation of the Trump administration’s possible withdrawal from the JCPOA dampened sales. In a concerning indication of the likely impact of the reimposition of US secondary sanctions on Iran in November 2018, European exports of goods in these categories fell to just over EUR 5,000 in December of last year, rising slightly to just over EUR 40,000 in the first month of this year. A general license would help address the decline in exports by giving legal clarity to European companies and banks regarding the status of the trade.",2019-04-04 00:00:00+00:00,"['monitoring', 'climate', 'help', 'heres', 'bazaar', 'sanctions', 'report', 'meteorological', 'disaster', 'recovery', 'flood', 'bourse', 'iran', 'technologies', 'change', 'states', 'irans', 'united']",Iran,news article,English
1843,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Extreme Monsoon Rains in Pakistan - nasa.gov - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147330/extreme-monsoon-rains-in-pakistan,"A heavy monsoon season has caused fatal flooding across Pakistan in 2020. More than 400 people have died since mid-June; another 400 were injured; and more than 200,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

The Sindh province in southeastern Pakistan, which received historic amounts of rain, has been the most affected region. The images above show a portion of Sindh on (September 21, 2020) compared to the same time last year (September 21, 2019). The false-color images, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite, use a combination of infrared and visible light (bands 7-2-1) to make it easier to see the boundary between water and land. Water appears navy blue and black; vegetation is bright green.

Sindh was hit by sporadic heavy rains in July and experienced record-breaking rainfall in August. Karachi, the provincial capital and countrys most populous city, recorded the most August rainfall in 89 years of record keeping. Karachi received around 490 millimeters (19 inches) of rain for the monthmore than 200 millimeters occurred within twelve hours. According to news reports, some of the urban flooding was the result of clogged stormwater drains.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported heavy rains in late August in other parts of the province, affecting the districts of Mirpur Khas, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Larkana. The Karachi, Hyderbad, and Mirpur Khas districts were declared calamity-affected areas. More than 2 million people across Sindh Province have been affected by monsoon rains this year, with 68,000 residents displaced in relief camps.

The government also reported that nearly one million acres of crops have also been destroyed by the flooding. Fields of cotton, vegetables, onions, tomatoes, and sugarcane have been affected.

Monsoon season generally lasts from mid-June through September. As of September 24, the PMD reported normal flow along the Indus and several other key rivers in the country.

1022,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,"Mozambique cyclones are “wake-up call,” says WMO - Mozambique - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-cyclones-are-wake-call-says-wmo,"Fact-finding mission makes recommendations for future resilience

Geneva/Beira, Mozambique, 29 May 2019 (WMO) - The devastation caused by cyclones Idai and Kenneth which hit Mozambique within the space of a few weeks is a wake-up call about more high-impact tropical cyclones, coastal flooding and intense rainfall linked to climate change, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

A fact-finding mission sent to Mozambique by WMO recommends a package of disaster risk reduction priorities to strengthen the southern African nation’s early warnings systems and cut socio-economic damages from weather, climate, and water-related hazards like tropical cyclones, floods and drought.

“The two cyclones are a wake-up call that Mozambique needs to build resilience,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a message to an international pledging conference to secure support for reconstruction.

“Although the number of tropical cyclones globally is expected to reduce in the future, the number of most intense tropical cyclones (category 4 and 5), associated with more rainfall, will increase in a warming climate,” he said.

“Future sea level rise will exacerbate the impact of storm surge on coastal regions, raising concerns about flooding from the sea, particularly for low lying cities as Beira,” said Mr Taalas. This raises major concerns regarding Mozambique’s vulnerability to floods from both rivers and sea.

The report from the international team of meteorologists and hydrologists, headed by WMO’s Filipe Lúcio, will be presented to an international pledging conference for Mozambique scheduled for 1 June in the coastal city of Beira.

The fact-finding team said that investment of nearly US$ 27 million is needed for the meteorological and hydrological sector. This includes reconstruction, rehabilitation and modernization of infrastructure and equipment, land surveys for flood risk mapping and satellite rainfall estimation, improved database management systems, training on the latest forecasting products, improved standard operational procedures, and better communications tools.

Unprecedented back-to-back cyclones

Idai made landfall in the vicinity of Beira on 14 March at Category 4 strength, provoking one of the worst weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere. Months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours.

The humanitarian consequences were huge. The cyclone and subsequent flooding caused the death of more than 600 people, injured an estimated 1600, affected more than 1.8 million and caused an estimated US$ 773 million in damages to buildings, infrastructure and agriculture.

“In times of floods, Mozambicans seek safety on roofs of buildings. But the ferocity of Idai’s winds blew the roofs away. The magnitude of the cyclone, the size of the storm surge and the extent of the flooding overwhelmed years of work by authorities in Sofala to increase community resilience to floods,” said Mr Lucio, who used to head Mozambique’s national meteorological service.

“It is a salutary warning about the future scale of the combined challenges from urbanization and climate change-related sea level rise and extreme weather. This will necessitate much greater emphasis on improved land use, urban and floodplain planning,” said Mr Lucio.

The fact-finding team’s visit coincided with tropical cyclone Kenneth, which made landfall on 25 April in Cabo Delgado province as the most intense tropical cyclone ever known to have hit the area.

The WMO mission focussed on Cyclone Idai, especially in terms of damages to hydro-meteorological equipment and institutional coordination and collaboration involving the meteorological, hydrological and disaster management services. However, its general conclusions are meant to inform plans and investments in strengthening the Early Warning System in a multi-hazard approach, and disaster risk management in the country, particularly during reconstruction to ensure building back better and overall strengthening of resilience.

Key findings

With Idai and Kenneth, the tropical cyclone warnings issued through WMO’s operational network – via its Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre La Reunion (Météo-France) were of good quality. Flood warnings were challenging, an area where special focus needs to be put.

“The critical problem however, was understanding the risk associated with the warnings, understanding what each person needed to do and limited response capabilities,” said the report.

The communication of messages needs to be simplified and should include indication of potential impacts. Education and awareness raising should be permanent, the mission found.

Early warning can only be effective if complemented by effective disaster management practices. There is a need for:

Effective floodplain management practices, including land use, urban planning;

Updated building codes to withstand intense tropical cyclone winds;

Multi-purpose infrastructure to serve as shelters in cases of tropical cyclones and accommodation during floods;

Consideration of structural measures for protection and management, where appropriate

The WMO team identified major weaknesses on preparedness, emergency coordination and response, including the following:

Absence of a communication system that can be used in the case of failure of normal communication means for warning and emergency operations;

Ineffective land use planning and enforcement for efficient floodplain management;

Absence of an evacuation plan for cities such as Beira, Búzi and Dondo;

Building codes not suitable to events of the magnitude of cyclone IDAI.

Limited capacities of key central and local government authorities to respond to emergencies;

Absence of an integrated approach for multi-hazard early warning systems;

Vulnerability

Mozambique is downstream of nine major river basins. It is prone to devastating impacts of floods but can also experience low-flows in rivers during drought due to water use upstream, exacerbating the impacts of droughts.

The biggest floods recorded recently were in 2000, when weeks of heavy rain exacerbated by tropical cyclone Eline caused the death of 700 people and affecting 2 million people.

With a coastline of 2700 km in the South West Indian Ocean, Mozambique is hit by a tropical storm or cyclone every two years on average – although Madagascar often acts as a buffer.

Climate change projections indicate a global decrease in numbers of tropical storms and cyclones. However it is projected that there may be increases in their maximum intensities and associated rainfall. Future sea level rise will exacerbate the impact of storm surge on coastal regions, assuming all other factors equal.

For the Province of Maputo, which has never suffered from direct hit of a tropical storm or tropical cyclone, and the Province of Gaza which was hit just once (cyclone Domoina in 1984) the likelihood of direct impact over these southern areas may increase over the next decades.

Notes to Editors

The World Meteorological Organization dispatched an expert mission to Mozambique to assess the requirements and capabilities of the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) and the National Directorate of Water Resources Management (DNGRH) and their coordination with the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) for an End-to-End Multi-Hazard Early Warning System in the context of disaster risk management. This report was possible through support provided by WMO, Météo-France and the UK Met Office, who supported and made available staff to integrate the mission. The mission was hosted by the National Institute of Meteorology of Mozambique. It consulted many national and international institutions, including the Ministers of Transport and Communications, Public Works and Housing and the Vice-minister of the Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development. The team also met the Governor of the Province of Sofala, the Mayor of the City of Beira and partner technical agencies in Beira.",2019-05-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['tropical', 'mozambique', 'warning', 'national', 'cyclone', 'mission', 'wakeup', 'cyclones', 'meteorological', 'wmo', 'management']",Mozambique,news article,English
1142,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Geospatial Work Identifies High-Risk Flooding Areas in Egypt Region - GISuser.com,https://gisuser.com/2016/11/geospatial-work-identifies-high-risk-flooding-areas-in-egypt-region/,"UT Dallas researchers and their colleagues have developed geospatial science methods to help the Egyptian government determine how to avoid flooding in a coastal mountain region.

The government wants to develop the area for tourism, but flash flooding and associated hazards have hampered efforts, said Dr. May Yuan, Ashbel Smith Professor of Geospatial Information Sciences.

“We developed methods in geospatial information sciences (GIS) to combine all the environmental factors associated with flash flooding and created a model to identify the high- and low-risk areas,” she said.

Yuan conducted the research, published in the Journal of Arid Environments, with co-authors from other universities in the United States and Egypt. The study focused on Nuweiba, a town on the east coast of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and its surrounding area where flooding threatens economic growth. The region is hot and dry during the summer, and gets heavy rain in the winter.

Researchers analyzed satellite imagery, conducted fieldwork and used other tools to determine a variety of factors that affect flooding, including rainfall and runoff patterns, flooding history, soil types, geology, vegetation, erosion, the steepness of the mountains and land elevation. By layering all the features on one map of the region, the scientists developed a GIS model to identify the most vulnerable areas.

“We developed methods in geospatial information sciences (GIS) to combine all the environmental factors associated with flash flooding and created a model to identify the high- and low-risk areas.” Dr. May Yuan, Ashbel Smith Professor of Geospatial Information Sciences

The assessment could be used to help officials make decisions regarding flood prevention and land use, Yuan said. The researchers recommended that the government focus on flood mitigation near a highway that runs along the Wadi Watir valley and two intersections.

The project is an example of how UT Dallas researchers are using GIS to help solve problems across the globe, said Dr. Denis Dean, dean of the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences.

“GIScience is a wonderfully broad field, and a study such as this demonstrates how it can integrate diverse disciplines such as economics, geology, hydrology, and so forth,” Dean said. “Since real-world problems are almost always interdisciplinary, GIScience is exceptionally well-suited to address these issues.”

UT Dallas offers bachelor’s, master’s and PhD programs in GIS, and graduate certificates in geospatial intelligence, remote sensing and geographic information systems.

Co-authors of the study were Dr. Sara Abuzied, of the University of Oklahoma, where Yuan previously taught; and Dr. Samia Ibrahim, Dr. Mona Kaiser and Dr. Tarek Saleem of the Suez Canal University in Egypt. The University of Oklahoma received financial support for the study from the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.

For a man who once wrestled a runaway cow to the ground, Ali (not his real name) appears timid and tranquil. The notoriety he gained on the bustling narrow streets of Newtown, a suburb of Accra, is something he is trying to shake off. His “rebirth” began four months earlier when he committed to never again taking Tramadol, a synthetic opioid used to moderate severe pain.

Africa remains one of the regions least served with effective pain relief medicine and although Tramadol is not the strongest of analgesics, it is a darling on prescription lists. That’s because unlike other opioids such as methadone and fentanyl, Tramadol is not internationally regulated, hence it is cheap and readily available for patients. Doctors prescribe Tramadol in cases of post-surgical pain, bone deficiencies and cancer and the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) classifies it among its ‘essential drugs’ list.

Unlike other opioids such as methadone and fentanyl, Tramadol is not internationally regulated, hence it is cheap and readily available.

However, in the last decade, the continent has seen a significant rise in the non-medical use of Tramadol, which produces similar effects to the “high” caused by heroin. Such is the popularity of Tramadol local Ghanaian users have it the nickname “Tramore” similar to the offical brand name, Tramal.

In Gabon, where Tramore is known as “Kobolo” high school teachers are struggling to contain a crisis. Upon request, some of Khartoum’s roadside tea-sellers are even known to drop the painkiller in a cup of tea. In January, Afrobeats rapper Olamide was forced to defend himself after Nigeria’s broadcasting regulators declared his hit song ‘Science Student‘ (which makes a reference to Tramadol) “unfit for broadcast” because of “the profligate mention and the subtle promotion of illegal drugs.” The singer (real name: Olamide Adedeji) argued he’s bringing awareness to a much ignored problem that’s spreading with young Nigerians on Lagos’ tough streets.

In Egypt, which has significant data about its national crisis, a 2015 study by the ministry of health and the UNODC found 100,000 people dependent on opioids with half of that number dependent on Tramadol [pdf p.6]. Again, 68% of patients seeking addiction treatment in government facilities did so because of Tramadol addiction [pdf p.6].

Ali first popped Tramore in 2007 after he started work at Accra’s Timber Market.”It was very hard work and Tramore helped him and his colleagues (who introduced him to it) work longer hours by numbing the pain that came with carrying heavy wood —the kind of numbness a person would need in order to confront a cow. Some farmers are known to give Tramadol to cattle who are then able to plough large tracts of fields at a go or walk long distances in search of pasture under the sweltering heat.

The popularity of Tramadol on the continent is not only for its pain relief. “I used to take it when I want to have sex. It gives me more strength to have sex,” a suddenly-shy Ali says. Researchers believe Tramadol’s aphrodisiac properties could stem from its antagonism of serotonin receptors hence delaying ejaculation.

Mumbai to Cotonou

Tramadol’s user base has become a draw factor for trans-African organized crime syndicates who smuggle Tramadol across Africa’s porous borders. After Egypt (where in 2012 alone, 620 million tablets were seized [pdf p.3]) increased its clampdown on illegal importation, Libya (because of political instability) became the new destination.

African governments remain fixated on criminalizing cannabis while Tramadol easily slips through borders to wreck citizens’ lives.

Last November, Italian authorities seized a Tramadol shipment from India to Libya worth 50 million euros. Six months prior, they had seized a shipment worth 75 million euros. Authorities believe they were destined for ISIS bases in Libya. The Cotonou port of the tiny country of Benin has also become the latest hub largely due to that country’s relatively weak Customs officials. In 2015, 40 million tablets of Tramadol was seized there. The following year, the US State Department declared Benin, a country of just 11 million people, the world’s second largest destination for Indian Tramadol.

From Benin, the tablets make their way across West Africa and the Sahel regions into the hands of terror groups such as al Qaeda, who have taken to the illicit trade in Tramadol as a source of funding, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

Tramadol has been found in the pockets of captured Boko Haram fighters as well as those who were killed in combat and suicide bombings. So while Tramadol is difficult to get from pharmacies without a prescription in many African countries, it can very easily be acquired from the dark alleyways of Bamenda, Newtown, Freetown or Libreville and under the table mats of rat poison vendors.

Tramadol is not internationally regulated by the International Narcotics Control Board in obedience to the World Health Organization’s wishes.

WHO is primarily concerned that scheduling Tramadol could inadvertently limit the licit use of the medication especially in the developing world where effective pain relief is already hard to come by, says Dr Martins Ekor, associate professor of pharmacology at the University of Cape Coast.

“The general concern, therefore, is that the negative effects of an international control on Tramadol’s medical availability will cause more pain patients to suffer. Developing countries will be the ones most severely affected since controlled strong opioids are barely available and patients already suffer from severe under-treatment of pain.”

“Tramore is too sweet, it is something when you take it, life is so good.”

But this lack of international regulation means that production of Tramadol is cheap. China and India became leading exporters of Tramadol [paywall]after its original German makers lost significant parts of the patent. Generic drug manufacturers there have in the last few years upped the dosage of Tramadol to around 250 milligrammes from the recommended 50 and 100 milligrammes .

The absence of international control coupled with the fact that Tramadol is synthetic and does not require organic ingredients means that manufacturers in Guangzhou and Mumbai have no production limits, are not required to record how many pills they make or alert countries beforehand that the pills are headed their way. The factories keep vomiting the pills.

Out of sight, out of mind

After his forays into Tramadol for work purposes, Ali soon found that he had become dependent on it, taking it for pleasure at social settings and on days that he wasn’t working. Downing Tramadol with energy drinks or dissolving it into fruit juices (to subdue its bitter aftertaste) is viewed by many as a socially acceptable and more discreet way of getting high in comparison to the telltale aroma of cannabis residual smoke.

“I take it today, tomorrow if I don’t take it, I start feeling weak…,” he says of the withdrawal symptoms which include nausea. His tolerance level shrunk and so did his body, a result of dwindling appetite for food. He has also seen a fair share of overdoses.

“You will see somebody sitting there, then he freezes and hits the ground. About two, three minutes, then he wakes up. You just don’t know what happens then you are on the floor.” He attributes the deaths of friends to overdoses, possible when Tramadol is mixed with alcohol [pdf p.6]. Although he doesn’t know the right word, other things he describes as happening to friends could be seizures, a chief side effect of Tramadol intoxication [pdf p.6].

But stories such as Ali’s are not widely known because of many societal problems including a class divide. Several African countries are on the cusp of an epidemic but there are few indications the authorities have even heard of it. The Tramadol scourge has received very little public attention from mainstream media and African governments because the victims do not look anything like the friends or families of Africa’s upper class citizens. That is because majority of victims are those at the very bottom of the socioeconomic ladder who need to work many long hours to make ends meet, hence their reliance on Tramadol. They are the Okada motorcycle riders, the head porters and truck pushers in markets, illegal miners and bus drivers. As such, the overdoses, the seizures, the vomiting, the comas, and the cardiovascular collapses are out of sight and out of mind for Africa’s privileged class.

This situation has some parallels with the US’ own opioid crisis which had largely been under-covered as a major issue until the last couple of years. In October 2017, president Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis, a public health emergency, making available more resources for addiction treatment.

Instead, African governments remain fixated on criminalizing cannabis while Tramadol easily slips through borders to wreck citizens, many of whom had no prior experience with illicit drugs until a buddy recommended a ‘sex power booster’.

A war on Tramadol?

Some African governments are slowly starting to pay attention. Because taking Tramadol without a prescription is not illegal in many countries, there has been a spike in the seizure of illegal consignments and arrests of street peddlers.

“We have put it under our national laws. We have added Tramadol to the list of scheduled drugs that is how come you need authorization to bring it in [and importers] have to report on utilization,” says Olivia Boateng, head of Tobacco and Substances of Abuse at Ghana’s Food and Drugs Authority. Earlier in March, the country’s minister of health told MPs new restrictive measures were in the works, including “[collaborating] with the Pharmacy Council to restrict Tramadol display on the shelves of community pharmacies by putting them under lock and key.”

Bureaucracies like this—similar in Nigeria and Egypt—are exactly why the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly shied away (on five separate occasions [pdf p.8]) from “scheduling” Tramadol, a move which would mean adding it to the list of internationally regulated opioids.

Aside from a fear of shortage for clinical practice, the WHO have taken this position because they remain convinced that “Tramadol has a low abuse potential” [pdf p.20] compared to other opioids despite new studies suggesting orally ingesting Tramadol increases its efficacy (previous studies looked at injected Tramadol). A WHO-preview report in November still did not propose scheduling Tramadol [pdf p.28].

The intransigence of the global health body means that combating the illicit Tramadol trade is hard. Although national bureaucracies ward off illegal shipments, it doesn’t mean countries such as Ghana, Nigeria and Egypt are insulated. The pills are simply shipped to ports in nearby Benin and Libya for onward distribution.

However, Professor Ekor is unconvinced that scheduling Tramadol is the panacea to the current abuse on the continent. While the WHO digs its heels in, Professor Ekor believes African governments especially those in ECOWAS, need to increase regional and international cooperation to detect and avert the diversion of Tramadol so that they do not end up in the wrong hands.

“[The situation] requires the implementation of targeted local measures to stop illegal activities…Therefore, a consistent implementation of local/regional actions and careful monitoring of the abuse situation will be more appropriate and effective in curbing the non-medical use of not just Tramadol but also other drugs or substances of abuse rather than international control.

There is also the need for medical intervention to help addicts wean themselves off the pills. For now, the likes of Ali, after seeing the pernicious effects of recreational Tramadol, are taking personal responsibility for their detoxification. He left the Timber Market job, changed friends and tries to stay away from places where he knows the red and green pills are sold at less than 25 cents.

But without a structured regime of rehabilitation, it is difficult to see how successful this self-journey will be for Ali, by his own admission “Tramore is too sweet, it is something when you take it, life is so good.”",2018-03-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['gabon', 'egypt', 'india', 'drugs', 'ghana', 'pain', 'crisis', 'work', 'international', 'countries', 'pdf', 'opioid', 'illegal', 'health', 'flood', 'african', 'quartz', 'tramadol', 'nigeria']",Egypt,news article,English
1996,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Lake Albert floods displace 150 families in Pakwach - Uganda - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/lake-albert-floods-displace-150-families-pakwach,"By IBRAHIM ADUBANGO

More than 150 families in Dei A Village, Panyimur Sub-county in Pakwach District are homeless after their houses were submerged following the rising water levels of Lake Albert.

Mr Nicholas Opar, the village chairperson, said the floods destroyed several houses and washed away crops.

The most affected communities are mainly fishermen from Singla Market, Kayonga and Wangkado in Panyimur Sub-county.

Mr Opar said most of the affected families were temporarily hosted by their relatives while others have sought refuge in nearby government primary schools.

“We are living in fear and anticipate a possible cholera and typhoid outbreak among others that may affect the community who live near the Nile and have occasionally been using the lake as their water source for domestic purposes,” he said.

Mr Shaban Ofoy, the sub-county chairperson, said the situation could create a food crisis in the area.

“We anticipate hunger because huge acres of gardens with crops were washed away,” Mr Kinobe said. He said they had previously warned the communities against settling in the wetlands but they have been hesitant to adhere to the directives because they had no place to relocate to.

Mr Robert Omito, the district chairperson, appealed to government and well-wishers for relief.

“We have notified the [Ministry] of Relief, Disaster and Preparedness, and Uganda Red Cross regional office to assess the level of devastation and come to our rescue urgently and attend to the village,” Mr Omito said.

He added that said since most of the affected families mainly rely on fishing as source of their livelihood, there is urgent need of relief supplies such as food, tents and blankets to temporarily settle the affected families.

Recurrent

In December last year, floods cut off Pakwach-Karuma road, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. The Uganda National Meteorology Authority, in its “seasonal rainfall outlook for March to May 2020,” warned that there would be an overall increased likelihood of near normal to above normal (wetter than average) rainfall in several parts of the country. Floods have also ravaged other districts, including Kasese, Ntoroko, Bundibugyo, Kabale, Ntungamo and Isingiro.

1600,FL-2021-000021-IND,No Link Between Char Dham Road Widening And Glacier Burst Tragedy: Centre - NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-link-between-char-dham-road-widening-and-glacier-burst-tragedy-centre-2372307,"Chamoli Glacier Burst: Several chronic landslide-prone locations exist on the three Char Dham highways.

The Central government today told the Supreme Court that there was no connection between the massive ongoing Char Dham road-widening project and the glacier burst earlier this month that resulted in the death of a number of people in Uttarakhand.

Attorney General KK Venugopal, representing the Defence Ministry, today sought time to respond to an allegation by the chief of an expert committee appointed by the court drawing a link between the two.

""We received a letter from the Chairman of the High-Powered Panel saying there is a link between the road widening and the Uttarakhand disaster. But according to us, Defence Ministry, there is no such connection. We want to reply to the allegations and need time,"" he said.

A bench of Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Hemant Gupta, and BR Gavai today granted two weeks to the government to come up with a response.

A glacier burst in the upper Himalayas on February 7 led to massive flash floods in the Alakananda-Dhauliganga river systems in Uttarakhand, leading to the deaths of over 50 people, with around 150 still missing. Environmentalists have sought to connect this with the massive developmental projects going on in the ecologically sensitive region over the past few years.

Ravi Chopra, one such expert, heads the Supreme Court-appointed panel that is monitoring the 900 kilometre Char Dham highway project that aims to connect four Hindu holy towns of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath in Uttarakhand. Besides being a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Rs 12,000 crore mission is also deemed strategically important.

In a letter dated February 13, Mr Chopra wrote to the court saying that an earlier report submitted by him and two other members of the panel had strongly argued that disaster resilience was more critical than simply wide highways.

""Several chronic landslide-prone locations and stretches, where the slope stability is precarious, exist on the three Char Dham highways identified by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as defence feeder roads,"" he wrote. ""The recent disaster in the Rishi Ganga valley is located in the region north...highly prone to landslides, flash floods and earthquake. A section of the defence road to the Indo-China border and a bridge across the Rishiganga river on that road have been swept away, lending credence to our argument for disaster resilience in the region.""

He emphasised against ignoring and overriding ""the profound and irreversible ecological damage to the Himalayas"" that will impact generations to come.

Planned as a 10-metre wide highway project, the Supreme Court last year ordered that it can only be 5.5 metres wide.

The Defence Ministry, citing security concerns, then petitioned the court to allow the widening of the road to 10 metres. Of the 26 members of the court-appointed panel, 21 are in favour of widening, which, the proponents say, will help in the movement of the armed forces along the Indo-China border and will ensure better amenities for the locals.

Mr Chopra, chief of the panel, has himself been against the widening of the roads. The Centre, meanwhile, wants the court to accept the report submitted by the panel.",2021-02-17 08:00:00+00:00,"['glacier', 'court', 'widening', 'defence', 'disaster', 'panel', 'link', 'tragedy', 'project', 'burst', 'char', 'ministry', 'road', 'dham', 'centre']",India,news article,English

Nine endangered Rothschild's giraffes are finally back on solid ground.

The efforts to rescue the animals started 15 months ago after rising waters caused flooding around Kenya's Lake Baringo in early 2020. According to a release from Save Giraffes Now â?? a non-profit committed to saving giraffes from extinction â?? the flooding stranded a group of Rothschild's giraffes on the lake's Longicharo Island, cutting the animals off from the resources they needed to survive.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

After learning of the giraffes' dire situation, Save Giraffes Now, the Ruko Community Conservancy, the Northern Rangelands Trust, and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) worked together to make a rescue plan. The fruits of this collaboration resulted in the creation of a custom barge (named ""The GiRaft"") and a 4,400-acre sanctuary on the mainland for the animals.

Rescuers used The GiRaft to float the animals, one by one, from the flooded island to the fenced sanctuary built for them within the 44,000-acre Ruko Conservancy.

""We felt a great sense of urgency to complete this rescue,"" David O'Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now, said in a statement. ""With giraffe undergoing a silent extinction, everyone we can protect matters, making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species.""

Ruko rangers introduced The GiRaft to the animals before they boarded, leaving the giraffes' favorite treats inside the barge, so they got used to the idea of getting on and off the vessel voluntarily. In December 2020, they started floating the animals to the sanctuary, only moving the giraffes when it was safe.

On April 12, the rescue mission came to an end when the last giraffe stepped off The GiRaft and into the sanctuary. Among the final giraffes to make the trek was Noelle, a giraffe calf born on the flooded island around Christmastime. Rescuers waited until the calf was strong enough the make the barge journey to the sanctuary comfortably before moving her.

Now, all of the giraffes are together again inside their new sanctuary, where rangers say the animals are looking happy and healthy. Protecting this group is especially important with so few Rothschild's giraffes left in the world. Today, fewer than 3,000 of these giraffes are left in Africa, with only about 800 in Kenya, per Save Giraffes Now.

""KWS is keen to grow the numbers of Rothschild giraffes in the country,"" Dr. Isaac Lekolool, senior veterinary officer for Kenya Wildlife Service, said in a statement. ""The management of Ruko Sanctuary, in collaboration with the local community, has done a commendable job in efforts to conserve this rare species. Indeed, Ruko Sanctuary is a model conservation initiative worth replicating elsewhere.""

""Not only did this groundbreaking project save these giraffes, but it also marks their reintroduction to the mainland for the first time in 70 years,"" O'Connor added. ""This rescue is a significant success for both of those reasons.""

From here, the long-term goal for the groups that rescued these giraffes is to introduce other Rothschild's giraffes from elsewhere in Kenya to those living in the sanctuary. These introductions will help build a genetically healthy population of giraffes that can eventually be released into the greater ecosystem outside the sanctuary.",2021-04-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['significant', 'safety', 'floated', 'northern', 'ruko', 'island', 'save', 'rescue', 'sanctuary', 'kenyan', 'stranded', 'animals', 'float', 'flooded', 'rothschilds', 'giraffes', 'success']",Kenya,news article,English
1798,FL-2020-000207-NGA,More can be done to plan ahead for flooding in West Africa - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/74954,"Source(s): African Development Bank (AfDB)



Early warning systems, contingency planning and local action can strengthen West Africas responses to increasingly frequent severe flooding, but more investment is needed in forecasting, panelists said in a recent webinar organized by the African Development Bank.

We need to explore new and innovative approaches to better forecast and communicate floods and early warning information, said Anthony Nyong, the Banks Director for Climate Change and Green Growth, in his opening remarks for the webinar Flood Forecasting and Early Warning in West Africa: Gaps, Innovation, and Lessons Learned.

In 2019 alone, extreme flooding caused the displacement of up to 5.1 million people in Africa, including 3.8 million from countries experiencing food insecurity. West Africa is a hotspot for extreme weather due to its long coastline, which is home to densely populated low-lying cities and economic hubs, from Lagos to Abidjan and Dakar.

This year, floods in eight West African countries affected over 750,000 people and claimed at least 100 lives. With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, the impact of floods in the region will likely accelerate over the next five decades.

The November 19 webinar, organized by the Banks Clim-Dev Africa Special Fund, brought together experts from Cte dIvoire, Nigeria, and Senegals national meteorological agencies to provide an update on flood forecasting and early warning systems (EWS) in West Africa.

A representative for the Niger Basin Authority discussed regional collaboration on flood forecasting among its nine members. The event included a panel discussion with leading experts from the Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

We know that flood EWS is a crucial flood management tool, comprising key components of disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, and forecasting-as well as communication and response. Yet, little is being done to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and operationalize flood forecasts and early warning systems, said James Kinyangi, Coordinator of the Clim-Dev Fund.

Ousmane Ndiaye, Director of Senegals National Meteorological Agency, said that better preparedness through climate information and multi-disciplinary planning targeting vulnerable populations is crucial to saving lives and property. He emphasized the importance of early forecasting and the use of social media platforms to broadcast alerts and provide real-time weather information in local languages.

Michael Talhami of the Red Cross said acting early and anticipating risk would reduce human exposure to disaster. All too often, he said, local actors and humanitarian organizations have to work with weather and climate data that is dated, of poor quality, or non-existent. One example is the abandonment of hydrometeorological data collection in rural Mali, which has had detrimental consequences for emergency preparedness and response.

The Banks Institutional Support to African Climate Centers Project (ISACIP) has invested over $35 million to improve climate information services throughout Africa since 2010. As a follow-up to ISACIP, the Bank, through the Clim-Dev Fund, is investing over $27 million in regional and country operations to modernize Africas climate and weather infrastructure and provide high-quality and reliable data.",2020-11-26 08:00:00+00:00,"['green', 'improve', 'head', 'flooding', 'climate', 'change', 'flood', 'growth', 'forecasting', 'west', 'early', 'warning', 'million', 'plan', 'preparedness', 'information', 'africa', 'weather']",Nigeria,news article,English
1814,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"April 2021: Ninth-warmest April on record, NOAA and NASA report - Yale Climate Connections",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/april-2021-ninth-warmest-april-on-record-noaa-and-nasa-report/,"April 2021 was the ninth-warmest April since global record-keeping began in 1880, 0.79 degrees Celsius (1.42F) above the 20th-century average, NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, reported May 13. NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Nia event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europes coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earths eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEIs annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Nia event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on Aprils disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people. By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexicos drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesias East Nusa Tenggara province.

Serojas total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorologys Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Nia ends

The moderate La Nia event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Nio/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Nia, reported that the 2020-2021 La Nia event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Nio 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5N-5S, 170W-120W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the neutral range. The range for weak La Nia conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia Universitys International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Nia conditions to remain neutral during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Nia, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Nio, with the odds of La Nia rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Nia events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.
