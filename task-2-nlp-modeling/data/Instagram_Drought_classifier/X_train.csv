The Mattole River headwaters was measured this morning to be flowing at a rate of 2,500 gallons per minute or 5.57 cubic feet per second. This flow is considered low. All headwaters tributaries are in forbearance, and the projected date for forbearance to begin for mainstem Mattole water users in the headwaters is June 19. This date is subject to change. Please do your part to conserve water by checking for leaks, turning down your pump rate, alternating pumping dates with your neighbors, acquiring more water storage if needed--plus other basic water conservation techniques such as turning off the water while brushing your teeth, etc.

Nearly record breaking low rainfall totals completely erased our winter rainfall surplus and plunged us into a moderate drought.  This spring's daily high temperatures were warmer than normal, but nighttime lows were cooler than normal in most locations.  Large day-to-night swings in temperature are more common when skies are consistently clear -- one of the major reasons we saw such little rain over the past few months.

.
Desertification and land degradation, caused primarily from mining, urbanization, and agriculture, are only worsened by global warming. Especially in dryland areas where agriculture or other land uses are hard on the soil, the ground quickly snowballs to a desert-like state. If plants aren't able to keep the soil together, the soil can degrade further, allowing even less plant life to take hold.
.
It's a slippery situation that could end up affecting hundreds of millions of people. Currently, there are 2 billion people that live in dryland areas that could eventually be at risk of being displaced by desertification. But even by the end of this next decade, 50 million people around the world could be displaced by desertification.
.
Just like with the Paris Climate Agreement, the Convention to Combat Desertification involves 122 countries that have committed to keeping soil arable and managing freshwater supplies. One initiative, the Great Green Wall, aims to restore over 380,000 square miles of African soil by 2030. Another initiative in the Gobi Desert includes planting trees in northern China to stop the desert's spread.

drought
/drout/
noun
1. a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water.

South Florida is in a drought. I‚Äôm not sure when it rained last but our ponds are drying up and now have ‚Äúsandbars‚Äù in them. The birds are enjoying the much easier pickings but man can we use some rain.

Good news, rain is in the forecast starting Monday!  Rainy season is here.

‚Äã
1) ‚ÄãStart at home by conserving your water usage... take shorter showers and turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or doing the dishes. ¬†And as much as we like green grass, be aware of how much water is being used outside!
‚Äã
‚Äã2) If you are looking to get out on the water and fish this summer, enact your own hoot owl... get out early and end early. ¬†Our fisheries will be stressed so be extra kind to the fish and #keepthemwet.

In October of 2017 I was hunting near Collins Lake after a major fire in the area. I pulled off the highway near the access point parking lot to one of the wildlife areas. I noticed this burned up remains of a fawn/yearling. This was within 10 to 20 yards of the paved Marysville road. This was the first time I had seen the remains of a deer that obviously had been killed by the wildfire. Many people think wildlife can just sense the fire and outrun it to a safe area. This was a really fast moving fire and obviously the fawn couldn't outrun it.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar, the Southwest US typically experiences monsoons in July and August. These are big thunder storms that build during summer heat and deposit LOTS of moisture in a short amount of time. The storms are powerful and fierce. Slot canyons and washes fill and flash flood. The last few seasons summers have gotten hotter and we legitimately haven‚Äôt had a monsoon season in years. Last summer we had a grand total of one thunderstorm in St George proper. And in tandem with this we see more frequent and more severe wildfires. Last summer there were at least five significant fires that were very real threats to residential areas in our town. This spring there have been a number of major fires IN town already. So this is all to say this is probably going to keep trending this way and climate change is real. Fight me.

The barrier will help slow the movement of saltwater into the central Delta and prevent contamination of #water supplies for Delta agriculture and municipal supplies for millions of Californians.

‚ÄúCalifornia is experiencing a second consecutive dry year and snowpack runoff into our state reservoirs has been far less than anticipated, so we are taking emergency actions to protect the state‚Äôs water supply and environment now,‚Äù said DWR Director Karla Nemeth. ‚ÄúDWR along with partner agencies is looking at all options to bolster the state‚Äôs drought response and mitigate drought impacts.‚Äù

The barrier will help prevent saltwater contamination of water supplies used by millions of Californians who rely on Delta-based federal and state water projects for at least some of their supplies. The #emergency barrier will also help conserve critical water supplies in upstream reservoirs for later use by avoiding the need to send large volumes of water into the Delta to repel salinity this summer.

‚ÄúKeeping saltwater from intruding into the central Delta is essential as a large portion of the state‚Äôs fresh water for urban and agricultural use goes through this part of the Delta,‚Äù said Ted Craddock, Deputy Director for the State Water Project.

On June 1, a temporary urgency change petition to modify State Water Project and Central Valley Project water rights conditions was approved by the State Water Resources Control Board, which will allow for water to be conserved for later instream uses and water quality requirements. These modifications are needed to help protect cold water pools for salmon and steelhead and maintain water quality while ensuring some water supplies are maintained if drought conditions persist next year.

This week, with the stories, we have prepared you for today's theme: Desertification. The ""United Nations International Convention on Combating Drought and Desertification"" defines this phenomenon as ""land degradation in dry, semi-arid and sub-humid dry areas, attributable to various causes, including climatic variations and human activities"".
(Comforting to always be one of the causes of malaise on our planet!) So what is it? It is the decrease and disappearance of the biological productivity and physicochemical properties of the affected soils, leading to the loss of vegetation. The soil, losing its properties, becomes dry, sandy and inhospitable even for the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù plants normally used to drought; and the strong and sudden rains we are used to do not help to contain the gradual disappearance of the vegetation cover. Consequently, the plants grow more and more slowly, making the ""natural barrier"" disappear, and the desert can only advance more and more.
This year's goal of #desertificationanddroughtday is to demonstrate the importance of healthy soil, in both environmental and economic terms, therefore, fighting against this phenomenon and ensuring that the soil is healthy is not only good. to biodiversity and to our Mother Earth (#respectmotherearthbitch), but also for human survival, and of those who, of land and cultivation, live there.

Many species have been under attack, literally, in western State's like Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. But Washington is stepping up and trying to protect their wildlife! Two Spokane-city lawmakers are advocating for a statewide ban on wildlife feeding to help protect the black bears in the State. 

Most of Washington state is currently under a drought advisory, with March and April being the fourth driest period on record for the state since 1895. Kile Westerman, a wildlife conflict specialist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said, they believe as a result from this, the food source available to the bears is ""less than ideal"" which means the bears have to go searching farther and are getting into more urban areas. While feeding bears is illegal, feeding deer and other wildlife is allowed in most of Washington. But bears will be bears, and when food is scarce they are opportunistic. As we know, this puts a target on the bears.

Councilwomen Lori Kinnear and Candace Mumm are planning to add a statewide wildlife feeding ban to the city's Washington State Legislative wish list. When the Legislature starts its 2022 session, Spokane's representative will advocate for some sort of wildlife feeding ban. This will eliminate many areas of concern, including human-bear conflict, the spread of chronic waste disease and the habituation of wild animals.

India is great with many amazing minds but I can't understand why we lag in such a basic thing.
We all know there is no life without water, but still the government doesn't seem to take firm steps on these issues.

Furthermore, as total precipitation for the year remains far below seasonal averages, there is growing confidence for drought conditions to persist into the foreseeable future. 

From the air, it is more difficult to see the impacts of drought, especially in its early stages. At the surface, many farmers are beginning to quietly hope and pray for a change in the weather pattern.

Some early fires are showing signs that those forecasts may be spot on. State Forester Bill Crapser joined us to discuss that and how they are planning to address things.

Bob Beck:¬†We're already starting to see some fires happening across the state. Anything there that gives you cause for concern?

Bill Crapser:¬†Right now we're a little bit ahead of where we were last year. So that's concerning the way last year turned out. Predictive Services, which is the interagency group that looks at fuels, weather, and predicts what they think is going to happen in the summer, they're saying that in June and July, most of the state will be in the high end of a normal fire season. But for August, they have the entire state in an above-average fire season. So we're pretty concerned about where we're going to be going this summer.

Black Lotus (Robinia pseudoacacia) is considered invasive in most countries and hasn‚Äôt the best reputation here as well. Been reading articles with titles like ‚ÄùRobinias, are they really that bad‚Äù and ‚ÄùA love affair gone away -why I won‚Äôt plant Robinia pseudoacacia in my garden again‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Hm, well, anyway! Look at the full grown individuals and the awesome flowers. Maybe we could just keep those and cherish what we have and plant other cool stuff like hickories and redwoods and smoke trees and nettle trees and cedars and so on and so forth.

Anyway, this tree is still useful for its durable wood and its also rot-resistant so maybe its not that surprising that this tree is common in central europe as a timber production tree. And its actually also very good for stabilizing soils with erosion problems. 

Plant it - or Don‚Äôt, I just love it right now!

Tuesday, June 22 @ 11:30am

--->Fire is a beneficial part of many ecosystems, but in recent decades more and more people have moved into the wildland-urban interface, setting the stage for more ‚Äúproblem fires‚Äù that affect the places where many Utahns live, work, and play. We have some choice in how or when wildfires occur, but it‚Äôs counterproductive to remove all fire from the landscape. Adjusting our perception of fire as a natural and necessary tool rather than purely as a threat can help us better manage our landscapes and future fires.<---

this year will be a heated theme.

Without H2O none of us would be here in a physical form. Water carries e~motions and it is interesting to see how the ‚Äòdrought‚Äô may correlate to the ‚Äòinner drought within humanity‚Äô that is needed to be felt, in order to change.

What feelings are we not in touch with? 

What are you using water for?

Growing lawn?
Non native high water usage plants?
Washing your car?

We all have people living ‚Äòdown river‚Äô from us.

Holding a enhanced capacity of ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô into how water nourishes nature closes the gap of receiving and giving.

As much as I love many plants, I support native plants the most. My mullein is thriving for example, with little to no extra water. So do the belly flowers... and my dogwood.

I have fountains and many water bowls for birds and other wildlife: deer, bobcats, bears, snakes, squirrels and chipmunks are frequent visitors to these holy places.

It has become an energetic oasis and sanctuary for them to come and be.

We are being asked to awaken. Ascending into higher planes of consciousness is by becoming aware in a harmonious ways of ALL there is. Being intuitive, having crystals and saying ‚Äòhip new age words‚Äô is not at all enough.

How are you with Mother Earth? 
Do you notice where you step your feet?
Are there little bugs? Or a tiny trying plant üå± on the road?

May your inner ‚Äòwaters‚Äô move you into unity and harmony to create a new balanced way for those of us who choose to live and experience the beauty and love there is.

And in my universe~ bubble it already is... 

With so much gratitude for each living plant and creature, to bless us with their harmonious non -destructive way of being.
May we remember and learn from them.

Each year, Lake Oroville helps water a quarter of the crops in the U.S. and anchors the tourism industry for a county that frequently has to rebuild after wildfires.‚Å†
‚Å†
But the lake is shrinking with surprising speed amid a severe drought, with state officials predicting it will reach a record low later this summer.‚Å†
‚Å†
The Department of Water Resources projects the lake will dip below its record low of 646 feet sometime in August or September. If that happens, the state will have to close the boat ramps for the first time ever because of low water levels.‚Å†
‚Å†
California's more than 1,500 reservoirs are 50% lower than they should be this time of year, according to one expert.‚Å†.‚Å†

- Minimal damage - but will worsen over time: if left unattended to, these will result in more significant damage in the future. They often go unnoticed.

By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl* ever was (Cook et al., 2014). The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China (Romm, 2015). Meaning, the suppliers of much of the world‚Äôs food will not be reliable sources anymore.

Drought and crops go hand in hand. The basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent (Battisti and Naylor, 2009). Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them (Wallace-Wells, 2017).

Theoretically, the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature. But the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature ‚Äî meaning even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity (Battisti and Naylor, 2009).

It is not as easy as simply moving croplands north. Yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there (Wallace-Wells, 2017). It takes about 1,000 years for three centimeters of topsoil to form (FAO, 2019). As professor David Battisti said: ‚ÄúPretty much all the arable land worth farming is already being farmed, so I‚Äôm not sure you can say where to go.‚Äù (Wallace-Wells, 2017)

Is desertification the world's biggest environmental problem currently?

Desertification should receive immediate attention
Far more of the Earth is covered by semi arid seasonal grasslands than forests, and about two thirds of the worlds grasslands are beginning to show signs of desertification.  Saving this land from total desertification should be the first point of call in tackling climate change, as preserving the fertility of these lands will help to reverse the greenhouse effect.  This is due to the large scale of additional photosynthesis this change could create, the plants of these regions effectively pulling large amounts of additional greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.

Lake Oroville has been drained so low that's its predicted it will not be able to generate hydro power at all by august it normally produces full power to 800,000 homes Oroville is the 2nd largest reservoir of the state of California and has the tallest dam in the u.s. 
Currently the water level at Oroville is hovering around 700 feet above sea level  when it reaches around 640 ft it will be shut off 
Similar situations are playing out for lake mead &Hoover dam they produce power for 8 million
If you get power from these areas do you have a back up power plan ?
Did you even know things are this bad? 
Here in California we are using a rubbermaid in our shower to water plants..we are using our grey water for the orchard..
1 spark and my town could be another paradise fire..and we have no water to put it out thanks in part to governor Newsom selling off our water to so cal
Yes things are this bad and getting worse by the day 

No water=no food
No water=fires
No water=no power 

Do you have a plan a..b or c

Photos by Pete McBride pedromcbride / Shortage: Lake Mead, the largest US reservoir, just saw its water level fall below 1075 feet (37% of full capacity) ‚Äî a marker it has only dropped below a couple times since the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s. In the past, the lake recovered quickly after hitting that line. But now, thanks to ongoing drought and hotter and drier weather patterns, it is predicted to keep dropping through 2022, with few signs of recovery ‚Äî triggering the first-ever water shortage declaration on the Colorado River. Years ago, I followed the river source to sea for a book about this over-loved, over-allocated lifeline and was shocked to see the river run dry before reaching the sea. It was a stark reminder of what happens when we ask too much of limited resources: They disappear. Today, this water supply continues to shrink, and yet we keep asking it to provide more.
