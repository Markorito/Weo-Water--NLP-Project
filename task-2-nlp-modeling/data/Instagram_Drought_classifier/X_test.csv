🔥 41 of 58 of California’s counties are in a state of drought emergency as the state continues to fall deeper into drought. This means more dry land, and potential for more wildfires.
🔥 Fire season has already begun. There have already been nearly 2,800 wildfires, with nearly 16,000 acres burned since the first of the year. This is an extremely early start for fire season, as less than 2,400 acres had burned by this time last year. Experts believe that as temperatures continue to rise and droughts sustain, parts of California will be in fire season year-round.
🔥 Cal Fire has hired nearly 1,400 new seasonal firefighters to combat the increased demand. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing an additional $38.9 million to staff current and additional Cal Fire crews.
🔥 Newsom also proposed an additional $2 billion to combat the fires this year, which would be the largest wildfire budget ever proposed by a governor, saying “Climate change has created a new wildfire reality in California.”

No campfires are allowed. So far this year there have been 326 wildfires in Utah, of which, 42 started in just the last week. 90% of the fires are human caused, and have lead to 12,000 acres burned. The low humidity in the air and the lack of rain or moisture on the ground makes it easy for wildfires to spread. There is no rain in the forecast. The Southwest relies on 2 major reservoirs on the Colorado River to keep water flowing to Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Temperatures are increasing due to climate change which produces much more evaporation, more loss of water from the reservoirs, a greater demand for water in agricultural systems that use water for crops. Even without factoring in less rain,  you would expect more water scarcity in the future. Although, I saw rain clouds there was nothing but a light drizzle lasting only a few minutes during this hike. I guess, Smoky Bear was right, when he said “Only you can prevent forest fires.” #drought #utah #thewave #thewavearizona",English

And time is running out to secure a better water future. 

Luckily, communities are hard at work, planning recycled water projects that can transform our state’s water supply

But we need your help. We’re asking you to include $750 million for recycled water in the drought package…this will ensure California’s water future, create jobs, and support our environment and economy…and that’s only the beginning.

It is time to invest in new drought tolerant water supplies for our State... and the time to address the problem is now.

Farmers in Rhineland-Palatinate have suffered from drought for the past three years. According to the German Weather Service, March and April 2021 were again too dry. Particularly difficult: Due to the lack of groundwater in the vegetable growing areas of the Vorderpfalz, some streams are literally pumped empty.

But not only here in the Palatinate there has been a drought for several years - Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg are also experiencing the severe drought particularly hard. Many of us certainly still remember the pictures of the fields in Brandenburg that were devastated in the truest sense of the word. That’s why I’m interested in: How about you guys?

• Developing a successful partnership with Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District provides recycled water to a portion of our district, saving potable water for essential uses.
• Doubling Kent Lake’s capacity in 1983.
• Adding Soulajule Reservoir to our system as a seventh reservoir, increasing capacity.
