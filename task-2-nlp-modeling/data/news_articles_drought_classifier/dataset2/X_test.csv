With the few that survived, he managed to stay at home in Qansahdheere, in southwestern Somalia. Six years on, as Somalia faces yet another humanitarian disaster, Hassan and his family have fled to Mogadishu hoping to find aid. Hassan and his family made it to the capital city’s only government-managed camp, Badbaado.

Half of Somalia’s population of 12.3 million people currently need humanitarian assistance. Legal, political and security restrictions and limited funding are restricting the access of international aid agencies to parts of the country, including areas controlled by the Islamist armed group Al-Shabab. Every day thousands of people like Hassan are moving into urban areas under government control, where international assistance is more likely to arrive. According to the United Nations, just under half a million people have fled their homes since November largely because of the drought, many arriving in Mogadishu and Baidoa, a town at the epicenter of the crisis.



But there are no quick solutions. The reality awaiting those like Hassan is often hostile and sometimes abusive.



Hundreds of thousands of people are in informal displacement camps, 400,000 in Mogadishu alone. Most arrived during the 2011 famine or due to ongoing clan fighting, military operations and insecurity in regions bordering the capital. Recent arrivals also include people who are returning from Kenya’s sprawling Dadaab refugee camp after the authorities said they would shut the camp down and started coercing refugees to leave.



Since the 2011 famine, people living in these settlements have faced serious abuse at the hands of government and private actors, including camp managers known as “gatekeepers,” who often have links to local authorities, business people and militias. Beatings, rape, including at times by African Union peace support forces, plus the diversion of food aid, restrictions on movement, and discrimination based on clan affiliation have marked their everyday lives.



The situation has not significantly improved.



Many of the people in the camps are from traditionally marginalized or less powerful communities, who rarely own or have rights over the land.



According to the UN and local women’s rights groups, rape remains widespread in Somalia’s displacement camps. To make things worse, a growing demand for land in central Mogadishu has triggered the forcible evictions of tens of thousands of people from the Mogadishu camps. In March 2015, government forces came with bulldozers and kicked out 21,000 camp residents in a 24-hour period, beating those who resisted and destroying their meager property.



While the escalating famine is receiving much needed news coverage, the evictions are not. Since November 2016, over 60,000 people have been forcibly evicted, including from camps where people like Hassan have been arriving.



The government’s Badbaado camp is not immune. In March, two people who had lived there told me that a man turned up with an armed militia and threatened and coerced dozens of families into leaving their shelters. “We reported the threats to the police,” said “Ibrahim,” who had been living in the camp since the 2011 famine. “They replied ‘You don’t have evidence!’ They took no interest, and told us to leave. When we saw that they were not going to help us, we decided to leave the camp.”



For people who are already hungry and in very precarious situations, evictions often mean losing the few belongings they have, including basic shelter, access to day labor opportunities and greater insecurity and hunger.



Limited job opportunities put displaced women and girls at particular risk of sexual violence and exploitation – including the longer and often hazardous journeys they have to take to find firewood or water, secure day labor, or beg.



Many of those evicted have been forced to move to more dangerous places on the outskirts of Mogadishu, where shelter is scarce and access to aid is even more limited. The families recently evicted from Badbaado, including Ibrahim’s, moved toward Lafoole–20 kilometers outside of Mogadishu, where they have since been joined by people fleeing the current drought.



Some residents told me they were now living in huts made of sticks, they had no access to clean water and sanitary facilities, and they had so far only received assistance from local business people and youth groups that have been trying to raise funds for those newly displaced.



Somalia’s new leaders say that averting a famine and dealing with the resulting health crisis is a priority. But ignoring systemic abuses and the vulnerabilities of people most affected by previous and ongoing crises means that the current efforts will have limited long-term impact in protecting these communities from future displacement and risk.



The new government should put a stop to forced evictions from public land. A draft displacement policy from the previous administration spells out how to conduct lawful evictions. The government needs to endorse that policy and make sure it is carried out. No one should be evicted without due process, and the government needs to make sure that basic security and assistance are provided to the areas people move to.



At the same time, the government, along with its international partners, should urgently improve the protection and security at informal settlements in the main urban areas, so that people like Ibrahim and Hassan can find protection and the help they need.",2017-04-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['safe', 'crisisstricken', 'hassan', 'famine', 'haven', 'camp', 'assistance', 'evictions', 'camps', 'evicted', 'including', 'somalia', 'displacement', 'mogadishu']",Ghana,news article,English

(Representational) In what could signal a reversal of change, both are now trading well above their MSP as the ongoing drought takes a toll on production. (Representational)

Like most other agricultural commodities, wholesale prices of jowar (sorghum) and maize for the most part of 2018 were much below their government-mandated Minimum Support Price (MSP). In what could signal a reversal of change, both are now trading well above their MSP as the ongoing drought takes a toll on production. In the case of maize — the third most important cereal in the country — the scarcity has led to calls for relaxation of tariff duty for imports.

Grown extensively across the country, maize is only the third most important cereal after rice and wheat for India. The annual consumption figure is estimated to be 220 lakh tonnes (lt), with poultry (as chicken feed) and starch industry alone cornering 70 per cent of it. India also exports around 7 lt of maize annually to countries such as Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

While it is mainly a Kharif crop in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana, growers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh also sow the crop during the rabi season.

For the 2018 Kharif season, Maharashtra reported 8.16 lakh hectares of maize plantation as against the normal 7.36 lakh hectares. Sowing, however, has taken a hit during the rabi season with the state reporting just about 1.15 lakh hectares of maize as against the normal 2.25 lakh hectares.

Across the country, industry estimates talk about an 8-10 per cent dip in availability of maize. Other than the drought, in Maharashtra, the dip in rabi area is also due to the low realisations in wholesale markets, which have weaned many farmers away from the crop.

Correspondingly, wholesale prices of maize have seen a positive move, with the average trade price of Rs 1,723.47 per quintal in the state being above the mandated MSP of Rs 1,700. In fact, this would be the first time prices have crossed the MSP in the last one year. Between September and November, when arrivals peaked due to the new crop, prices were in the range of Rs 1,200-1,300 per quintal. The present upward mobility in prices, industry sources point out, is only to be enjoyed by stockists who have raised inventories during the last few months. All eyes are on the rabi crop of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which is to hit the markets by April.

Rohit Pawar, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pune-based poultry firm Baramati Agro Limited, said the present Rs 2,000 per quintal rate has increased the cost of production for all poultry farmers. “The effects will be soon seen in retail prices of chicken,” he said.

Industry bodies have opened talks with the government given that imports at present would attract a steep duty of 60 per cent. Import of maize is governed by tariff rate quota norms, which require government intervention for easing of duty.

Prasanna Pedgaonkar, the Deputy General Manager of Pune-based poultry firm Venkateshwara Hatcheries Private Limited — popularly known as Venky’s — said the industry had asked for phase-wise import of around 20 lt of corn, but the government is yet to consent to it. “It would be three years since the last imports of maize in the country,” he said.

But with general elections round the corner, chances of imports seem dim given the effect it might have on prices.

Like maize, the reversal in the price trend of jowar has much to do with the dip in sown area reported in Maharashtra. An important millet, especially for rural parts of the state, Maharashtra reports around 30.98 lakh hectares of jowar sowing, 23.79 hectares from rabi season alone. This year, till January 25, the state had reported 12.46 lakh hectares of sowing — an almost 50 per cent dip.

Accounting for around 30 per cent of the national production, Maharashtra is the largest producer of the millet in the country.

In tandem with the dip in sowing, wholesale prices of jowar in the state have started rising. The average traded price of jowar now stands at Rs 2987.05 — a whopping Rs 500 per quintal above the mandated MSP of Rs 2,450 per quintal for maldandi and Rs 2,430 per quintal for hybrid jowar. Prices have risen 14.68 per cent since December, with trade sources talking of a further rise.

Amit Wadikar, a trader operating out of Baramati’s wholesale market, reasoned that the present price hike is mostly to do with the dip in the rabi crop due to drought. “Other than Solapur, Ahmednagar, a similar drop has been reported from neighbouring Karnataka,” he pointed out.

At the Baramati market, prices have been averaging around Rs 3,800 per quintal mark. Prices however were much below the MSP threshold, with the state reporting prices in the range of Rs 2,200- 2,300 per quintal, in the months of September, October. It was only since November, when the effects of drought became clearer, that prices have firmed up.

Besides, jowar and maize are also an important source of green fodder for animals, giving the farmers an extra source of income. With fodder scarcity looming large over the state, the farmer is faced with a double loss. Ankush Padvale, a farmer from Khupsangi in Solapur’s Mangalwedha taluka, lost 5 acres of his rabi jowar due to moisture stress, he says. “There was no water for the corp to grow, my investment was in vain.”

Noting the bull run in the jowar prices, Padvale says it comes at a time when farmers like him have no crop to sell.",2019-01-31 08:00:00+00:00,"['maize', 'rs', 'state', 'poultry', 'quintal', 'lakh', 'pushes', 'jowar', 'drought', 'msp', 'prices', 'rabi', 'units', 'losses', 'maharashtra']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
426,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Drought in Afghanistan: Worst in recent history - SOFREP,https://sofrep.com/news/drought-in-afghanistan-worst-in-recent-history/,"War, corruption, and poverty have plagued Afghanistan for generations. These have generally led to a myriad of exacerbating issues like a lack of healthcare infrastructure, education, and political unification. Now another devastating obstacle has struck the country: the worst drought in decades.

Droughts of this magnitude are going to affect any country severely, but this one hits Afghanistan particularly hard. Agriculture is Afghanistan’s economic foundation — according to the CIA World Factbook, it composes approximately 23% of the country’s GDP. To contrast, agriculture makes up 0.9% of the United States’s GDP.

20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces have felt the brunt of this drought, and millions of Afghan people have been devastated by its effects. This means dead livestock, failed harvest, and of course, a lack of basic access to water. Thousands of households have been displaced, forced to abandon their homes and move elsewhere where they can find water.

According to the European Commission Humanitarian Aid and Emergency Response Mechanism,

Particularly hard hit are the provinces of Ghor and Badghis, who have generated displacement of over 9,000 households into Herat City, and approx. 1,000 households in Qala e Now, Badghis. The vast majority of these households remain unassisted, lacking access to safe drinking water, shelter or adequate sanitation facilities and food, and as a result, sinking into increased vulnerability; sinking into increasing levels of vulnerability and employing negative coping mechanisms such as skipping meals and using money lenders to feed their families.”

Some countries are pitching in to help — the U.K. recently donated $13.1 million to The World Food Programme, who aims to provide aid in the areas worst affected by the drought. They plan to reach and contribute to 1.4 million people, not only providing them with basic supplies but enabling them to have a more successful harvest next year.

This is an essential approach to humanitarian aid necessary to help the Afghan people suffering from this drought. A short-term fix may be welcome, but a more effective, long-term solution includes a level of sustainment that will last longer than just a few months. This is particularly important not only for the families themselves, but to mitigate all the issues involved in mass-migration into major population centers. The drought we see now could amount to what would effectively be a domestic refugee crisis, akin to what the U.S. saw as the “dust bowl” dried up in the 1930s — except in a country that is already afflicted by perpetual war.

The Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority (NSDMA), in coordination with Regional Meteorological Centre, Guwahati, issued a weather update for the coming days on Tuesday.

According to the update, the second half of this period is expected to get more intense than the former. During this period, thundershowers and lighting accompanied by heavy rains are expected in Mon, Mokokchung, Longleng, Tuensang, Peren, Phek, Kiphire and Zunheboto districts.

The state capital Kohima is likely to have moderate to heavy rains from July 7 to July 10.

Nagaland’s major river Dhanasiri may have large flow of water as river Brahmaputra is above the danger level at many places due to the prolonged spell of heavy rain in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

The NSDMA said it is important to take necessary precautionary measures during this time as most rivers of the state are North-South flow and may overflow because of intense rains in the catchment areas.

It urged the public to be vigilant and not to shelter under large trees and near the river banks to prevent unnecessary risk to life from lightning and flash flood.

The NSDMA also requested the district disaster management authorities and other line departments, which are responsible to attend to any emergencies caused by natural calamities, to be on alert to save lives and properties during this monsoon period.",2020-06-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['management', 'nsdma', 'update', 'large', 'state', 'heavy', 'rains', 'period', 'experience', 'nagaland', 'river', 'days']",India,news article,English

6,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Bottled Water Comes From the Most Drought-Ridden Places in the Country – Mother Jones - Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/08/bottled-water-california-drought/,"



Update, 4/13/15: This article has been modified from its original version to include updated drought maps and information from the Desert Sun investigation.

Bottled-water drinkers, we have a problem: There’s a good chance that your water comes from California, a state experiencing the third-driest year on record.

The details of where and how bottling companies get their water are often quite murky, but generally speaking, bottled water falls into two categories. The first is “spring water,” or groundwater that’s collected, according to the EPA, “at the point where water flows naturally to the earth’s surface or from a borehole that taps into the underground source.” About 55 percent of bottled water in the United States is spring water, including Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead.

The other 45 percent comes from the municipal water supply, meaning that companies, including Aquafina and Dasani, simply treat tap water—the same stuff that comes out of your faucet at home—and bottle it up. (Weird, right?)

But regardless of whether companies bottle from springs or the tap, lots of them are using water in exactly the areas that need it most right now.

The map above shows the sources of water for four big-name companies that bottle in California. Aquafina and Dasani “sources” are the facilities where tap water is treated and bottled, whereas Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead “sources” refer to the springs themselves.

In the grand scheme of things, the amount of water used for bottling in California is only a tiny fraction of the amount of water used for food and beverage production—plenty of other bottled drinks use California’s water, and a whopping 80 percent of the state’s water supply goes toward agriculture. But still, the question remains: Why are Americans across the country drinking bottled water from drought-ridden California?

One reason is simply that California happens to be where some bottled water brands have set up shop. “You have to remember this is a 120-year-old brand,” said Jane Lazgin, a representative for Arrowhead. “Some of these sources have long, long been associated with the brand.” Lazgin acknowledges that, from an environmental perspective, “tap water is always the winner,” but says that the company tries to manage its springs sustainably. The water inside the bottle isn’t the only water that bottling companies require: Coca-Cola bottling plants, which produce Dasani, use 1.63 liters of water for every liter of beverage produced in California, according to Coca-Cola representative Dora Wong. “Our California facilities continue to seek ways to reduce overall water use,” she wrote in an email.

Then there’s the aforementioned murkiness of the industry: Companies aren’t required to publicly disclose exactly where their sources are or how much water each facility bottles. Peter Gleick, author of Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession With Bottled Water, says, “I don’t think people have a clue—no one knows” where their bottled water comes from. (Fun facts he’s discovered in his research: Everest water comes from Texas, Glacier Mountain comes from Ohio, and only about a third of Poland Springs water comes from the actual Poland Spring, in Maine.)

A recent Desert Sun investigation reported that the Nestle Waters, the company that owns Arrowhead, has been transporting water out of the San Bernadino National Forest using a permit that expired in 1988. The Forest Service hadn’t examined the impacts of the bottled water industry on the region. Since the investigation, Forest Service representatives have said that examining the permit is a “priority,” and Lazgin wrote that Arrowhead plans to comply with the permit renewal process.

Despite the fact that almost all US tap water is better regulated and monitored than bottled, and despite the hefty environmental footprint of the bottled water industry, perhaps the biggest reason that bottling companies are using water in drought zones is simply because we’re still providing a demand for it: In 2012 in the United States alone, the industry produced about 10 billion gallons of bottled water, with sales revenues at $12 billion.

As Gleick wrote, “This industry has very successfully turned a public resource into a private commodity.” And consumers—well, we’re drinking it up.",2014-08-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['industry', 'bottled', 'tap', 'places', 'droughtridden', 'jones', 'california', 'springs', 'water', 'comes', 'country', 'mother', 'companies', 'bottling', 'sources']",China,news article,English

By Sophie Hares

TEPIC, Mexico, Sept 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Severe flooding on the Amazon has increased amid changing weather patterns, and is harming the health and incomes of people living along the world's biggest river, scientists said.

Analysing more than 100 years of records measuring Amazon River levels in the port of Manaus in Brazil, they found extreme floods that occurred roughly once every 20 years in the first part of last century are now happening about every four years.

""There are catastrophic effects on the lives of the people as the drinking water gets flooded, and the houses get completely destroyed,"" said Jonathan Barichivich, environmental scientist at the Universidad Austral de Chile.

""Our findings unravel the ultimate causes of the recent intensification - wet season getting wetter, and dry season getting drier - of the water cycle of the largest hydrological basin of the planet,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Droughts have also become more frequent in the past two to three decades, but the rise in flooding stood out, he noted.

In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers from institutions including Britain's University of Leeds said severe flooding had affected the Amazon basin nearly every year from 2009 to 2015.

They linked the increase in flooding to a combination of warmer temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and cooler temperatures over the Pacific.

Known as the Walker circulation, this effect influences tropical weather patterns, and can partly be attributed to shifts in wind belts caused by global warming, the study said.

With temperatures in the Atlantic expected to rise more than in the Pacific, flood risks on the Amazon River will persist, the scientists predicted.

""We think that it's going to continue for at least a decade,"" said Barichivich, formerly a University of Leeds research fellow.

The paper also noted that deforestation and construction of hydro-power plants could play a role in water-level changes.

Besides disrupting cattle ranching and agriculture on the river's flood plains, heavy flooding has health consequences for communities in Brazil, Peru and other Amazon nations, as it contaminates water and helps spread disease, said the study.

Monitoring changes in river levels is important because the Amazon basin and its tropical rainforest play a major role in the world's hydrological and carbon systems, said Barichivich.

1866,FL-2021-000038-KEN,MOROCCO: IFC finances studies on the recovery of industrial waste in Tangier - AFRIK 21,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/morocco-ifc-finances-studies-on-the-recovery-of-industrial-waste-in-tangier/,"In Morocco, the management of industrial waste remains very sensitive. The Cherifian kingdom produces 1.5 million tonnes of industrial waste each year, of which about 350,000 tonnes are identified as hazardous. According to the Moroccan authorities, only 23% of this waste is recycled in the kingdom, yet it is very harmful to humans and the environment.

The General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (TTA) and five associations representing investors in the Tangier Export Processing Zone, the industrial zones of Gzenaya, Mghogha and Al Majd, as well as the Tangier Automotive City free zone, want to improve industrial waste management in Morocco. On April 15th, 2021, these key players in the Moroccan economy launched studies for the recovery of industrial waste in the Kingdom.

Initially, the waste management project will be deployed in Tangier, the second largest economic hub in Morocco after the city of Casablanca. The initiative, implemented by a specialised international office, will make it possible to define the best model for managing this type of waste for the city of Tangier. This model can then be applied to other cities in Morocco. The studies, which will last four months, will also promote the development of a circular economy around industrial waste, thus creating employment opportunities for young Moroccans.

IFC funding

The studies on industrial waste management in Tangier are being financed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank Group responsible for financing the private sector. The results of the investigations will also be used by waste management companies, such as Suez, that wish to invest or set up in Morocco. In this North African kingdom, the French group manages the waste produced in the factories of car manufacturers PSA and Renault.

In March 2021, the local subsidiary of the French environmental giant Suez Maroc also won the contract to manage the waste of the Moroccan Tobacco Company (SMT). This new contract will run for two years.

865,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Southern Africa: Drought Leads to SADC Grain Shortage of More Than 5 Million Tonnes Affecting 41 Million People - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907120084.html,"Women from Zimbabwe’s Lupane District invest the profits of their craft sales in ‘keyhole’ gardens to ensure food security (file photo).

A regional food security assessment indicates that southern Africa has a cereal deficit of more than 5.4 million tonnes this year following a subdued 2018/19 farming season.

This is according to a Synthesis Report on the State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa approved by the SADC Regional Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis (RVAA) Programme Steering Committee that met on 05 July in Windhoek.

Based on the 11 SADC member states that provided cereal balance sheets for the 2018/19 harvest year, the region produced about 37.5 million tonnes of cereals compared to 42.9 million tonnes in 2017/18.

The countries that provided cereal balance sheets for the 2018/19 season are Angola, Botswana, the DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The report revealed that cereal production in South Africa, which usually accounts for the largest proportion of regional output, decreased by 19% from 18.7 million tonnes during the 2017/18 season to 15.1 million tonnes this year.

Zambia, which has during the past few years significantly contributed to regional cereal output, suffered a 14.7% decline in production from 2.6 million tonnes in 2017/18 to 2.2 million tonnes in 2018/19.

The largest drop in output is in Botswana where cereal production is estimated to have declined by 92% during the 2018/19 season, while Namibia and Lesotho experienced 53% and 50% decreases, respectively.

The least affected countries are Angola and Tanzania, which recorded decreases of only 1% and 4% respectively.

Maize accounts for 80% cereal production in southern Africa. Other important cereals are wheat, sorghum, millets and rice.

According to the regional food security assessment report, the decline in cereal production indicates that ""an estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food-insecure this year.""

The 13 countries are Angola, Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The remaining three SADC Member States - Mauritius, Comoros and Seychelles - did not provide figures on their food security and vulnerability assessments, meaning that the number of food-insecure people in the region could be much higher.

""When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year and this year, food insecurity increased by 28%,"" according to the report. It also noted that food insecurity this year is even higher than the devastating drought of 2016/17.

""Namibia is responding to the drought by distributing food relief and agricultural inputs, as well as the provision of water to the affected population,"" Namibian Deputy Director for Policy, Disaster Risk Management Directorate, Anastasia Amunyela, said at the SADC RVAA meeting.

Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are importing grain to supplement their reduced yields.

The plight of the three countries was worsened by the impact of Cyclone Idai that hit the region in March.

Other contributing factors that worsened the low harvest in most SADC member states include the Fall Army worm infestation.

In the medium to long term, the Synthesis Report on the State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa urges SADC member states to move to crop and dietary diversity through the growing and consumption of diversified diets, including indigenous foods.

Furthermore, the region should improve its transport network so that agricultural produce can move smoothly from one place to another. It is also critical to invest in storage facilities to allow farmers to store their harvest for use in poor seasons.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, post-harvest crop losses in SADC is estimated to be as high as 40%.

Since its establishment, the SADC RVAA Programme has made significant strides in providing timely and credible information that has influenced policies, and its products are now a vital reference point for decision makers in addressing food and nutrition security issues.

121,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Famine Has Always Had A Hold Of Africa's Horn | JimmaTimes.com - Jimma Times,https://www.jimmatimes.com/famine-has-always-had-a-hold-of-africas-horn/,"In many parts of northeastern Africa, the spring rains have not arrived for three years — triggering massive crop failures and threatening almost 16 million people with starvation. Thousands have already died; about 400 people are now dying each month in Gode alone. Wars in the region are preventing the delivery of food; in some places, men with Kalashnikov rifles, patrolling what remains of watering holes, turn away people dying of thirst. Nomads, many little more than wandering skeletons, walk for days in search of relief workers with food. Others sit, exhausted, and wait for death to find them.

Children are the first to die. At a makeshift shelter in the town of Denan, 110 km southeast from Gode, mothers holding their malnourished children stare blankly into space. The children are often too sick to eat. When one mother tries to force-feed her baby daughter, the formula drips down the little girl’s chest. The baby’s eyelids flicker, and nearing death she drops her head — just as an aid worker directs another woman to a mat where a child had just succumbed.

United Nations officials first warned of the impending famine last year, when the rains did not arrive for the second time. Since then, food aid has been slow in coming — an eerie parallel with the famine of 15 years ago that killed nearly one million people in Ethiopia. Aid organizations have accused donors of dragging their feet, just as they did in 1984 when relief efforts did not kick into full gear until television broadcast the tragedy and musicians tugged at the world’s conscience with the poignant songs Do They Know It’s Christmas? and We Are the World.

As it was 15 years ago, violence is also complicating aid efforts. Ethiopia has been fighting a 23-month-long border war with neighbouring Eritrea. The fighting has killed tens of thousands of soldiers and cost Ethiopia an estimated $1 billion. Even with widespread starvation looming, the government last year tripled its defence budget to $700 million. “They shouldn’t be fighting a war over a small patch of land when their own people are starving,” says John O’Shea, the head of Goal, an Irish aid group in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. “It’s a savage war and it’s taking a lot of resources away from the aid effort.”

Donors, particularly some European nations, have been reluctant to make good on their pledges of aid, partly for fear of it being diverted to the battlefront. But as images of children reduced to skeletons reach Western television screens, donors are also aware they run the risk of appearing callous by withholding aid. Most are now stressing that the military and humanitarian situations are separate — and are loosening their purse strings while exhorting Ethiopia to end the hostilities. But the Ethiopian government makes no apologies for continuing the war. “We do not believe that protecting one’s sovereignty,” says Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia’s prime minister, “is a luxury for the rich alone.”

Canada, which recently committed $16 million to the Ethiopian aid effort, intends to ensure that the 24,000 tonnes of food and medicine it supplies reach those who need it. Maria Minna, minister for international co-operation, said that when the aid arrives, it will be turned over to the United Nations and leading relief organizations like Oxfam for distribution. To ensure that it does not fall into the wrong hands, Minna said Ottawa will go one step further. “We plan to hire monitors to make sure the food is delivered to those it should go to,” said Minna, who spoke to Maclean’s from Senegal where she was attending an education conference last week. “So we will follow the grain to the people.”

Aid agencies say they need about one million tonnes of food to deal with the current crisis. International pledges currently stand at 800,000 tonnes, a very significant increase from a month ago when they stood at only 400,000 tonnes. And Minna is hopeful that enough food will get through to slow the growing humanitarian disaster. “We are ahead of the curve,” she said, “and this is why we are shipping now.”

Delivery, though, is bogged down in a logistical nightmare. Landlocked Ethiopia has dismissed an Eritrean offer to use Assab, Eritrea’s main port, to receive shipments. Aid will have to be taken through a port in the neighbouring country of Djibouti, which is capable of handling only 150,000 tonnes per month — much less than Assab. Canada will spend $250,000 as part of an international effort to upgrade the port in Djibouti, but roads into Ethiopia are in terrible shape and it could still take months to get food to the people in greatest need.

Violence is also slowing food delivery in other areas of east Africa. In Somalia, where 1.5 million people are at risk of starvation, fighting between rival militias has resulted in the suspension of emergency food supplies. In Sudan, 1.7 million people are facing starvation, but because of the country’s protraWected civil war, relief is not getting through to some areas. Ethiopia, meanwhile, is fighting the Oromo Liberation Front in the country’s southern region. And there are now fears that the drought will get worse, with weather forecasts indicating that this year the rains will fail to arrive once again. And that will surely lead to more death by starvation across the region.",2015-10-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['hold', 'million', 'aid', 'war', 'minna', 'famine', 'tonnes', 'food', 'starvation', 'relief', 'africas', 'fighting', 'horn', 'ethiopia']",Somalia,news article,English
688,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Talk yourself right into a job - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/talk-yourself-right-job,"Talk yourself right into a job

I’m sure you’ve heard the expression used to describe people who can work a room: They have “the gift of gab.” The people we describe that way seem to have been born with the ability to converse. They move comfortably through crowds at social events, going from conversation to conversation with what appears to be the greatest of ease.

Luckily for most of us, that kind of outgoing nature is not necessary for job search success. Yes, communication is crucial. But unlike the innate gift of gab, you can develop the career communication skills you need. With attention, practice, and some self-awareness, you’ll be in good shape to make your communication skills work for you at various steps throughout your job search and career development path.

Reach out and listen

Industry careers are so different from academia that I think of that world as being in a parallel universe. Sure, it looks much the same. There’s the lab bench, and people are doing science. But, just as in those science fiction movies, all the rules have subtle but important differences. And it’s important to learn as much as possible about this new universe of jobs before trying to become a part of it. Doing so requires that you talk to people—and, even more importantly, that you listen.

Most conversations are 50-50. If you and I sit down to talk sports over a beer, we’re going to each spend about half the time talking up our own team. But when you open up a conversation with someone on the far side of a parallel universe, you’re in the listening zone. This isn’t the time for some kind of sales pitch about how great you are—or questions about whether there are openings at their company. Instead, focus on the fact that you want to learn what their world is all about: how companies grow, how and why they hire, what your contact’s job is like, and how she or he managed to land it in the first place. The most helpful kind of information can be found via a serious sit-down, typically referred to as an informational interview.

Being a good listener doesn’t mean that you don’t talk about yourself at all. You still want to communicate that you would be a good potential hire or network contact. But the latest thinking is that the frequently referenced “elevator pitch” is too one-sided and doesn’t offer enough space for conversation to develop. (We should probably take that word “pitch” and erase it from our job search lexicon, leaving it completely to vendors and insurance salespeople.) Today, you might instead add to the conversation by interjecting short nuggets of rehearsed language about your key skills and abilities, as well as other personal information.

I can’t tell you which of your strengths you should highlight in this way, but the Challenge-Approach-Results exercise is a good way to remind yourself of what they are and how they’ve worked to your advantage. This easy process will remind you how important it is to talk about your skills and accomplishments in succinct language to emphasize the value that you offer.

Make yourself a candidate

When people talk about the job search, “applicant” and “candidate” are often thrown around interchangeably. But there’s a difference. In hiring manager parlance, an employer can have hundreds of applicants for a job, but there are probably only a handful of them who are actually candidates. And one of the ways to elevate yourself from applicant to candidate status is—you guessed it—communication.

Applicants are often treated as if they are a dime a dozen. They come in swarms off the internet via online job applications. A job is posted on Thursday afternoon and—wham!—300 applicants by Monday morning. Sadly, employers can mistreat applicants because there are so many of them. Job ads can list 10 requirements—which may not actually be crucial for performing the role—in an attempt to thin the herd. Or, applicants can be required to fill out stupid questions on an online application. (“What is your expected salary here at ABC Biotech?”) But with candidates—that short list of people who are actually a good fit for the role and will move forward in the interview process—companies make an effort to ensure that they don’t lose even one of them along the way.

A few applicants may turn into candidates. But the best way to set yourself up as a candidate instead of an applicant is by getting an internal referral. To the human resources executive tasked with sorting through the pool of job seekers, it’s a relief to have some that come pre-approved, ready to be interviewed by a hiring manager.

Wouldn’t you rather be positioned as a candidate, as opposed to being a part of the swarm? If that’s the case, get out there and talk to people at the companies you’re interested in. Even if you’re not in job search mode yet, starting this process will help you begin to see which industry jobs might be a good fit for you so that you can build your network and, when the time is right, target jobs.

Two big opportunities on interview day

If you’ve made it to interview day, first of all, congratulations! You’re a bona fide candidate. But that doesn’t mean that communication ceases to be important—quite the contrary. How you present yourself during your interview is a crucial part of how employers decide whether you’ll move on to the next round or get the offer. It’s important throughout the day, which is usually filled with meetings featuring back-and-forth exchanges aimed at uncovering the fit between the company and the prospect (you). But there are two moments that are particularly important: your first impression and when you close each of those meetings with your last impression.

The job talk is often put at the front end of the day, so you will be making a first impression on a lot of people all at once. In the front of their minds, your audience at the job talk will be reviewing the science you present—but they wouldn’t have invited anyone into an interview who doesn’t do good science. Sure, you need to present well and be prepared for tough technical questions. But much of the first impression will depend on factors other than your science. Keys to a good first impression include the sound of your voice, your confidence, and the demeanor you project—which will ideally convey the warmth and friendliness of a potentially great teammate.

So, think about all aspects of the message you are sending. Did you separate the “we”s from the “I”s when you talked about your work? (“In the Smith lab, we do trait integration into legumes. In this particular experiment, I identified the marker for drought resistance in pigeon pea and then began a marker-assisted breeding program for that trait.”) Did you reinforce the “I’m a problem solver” nature of your experience? Employing these types of tactics is not bragging; it’s completely ethical self-promotion. You should do so sparingly, but at critical moments.

Finally, the last impression you make as you walk out the door of each office is important too. The things that will make you memorable will be your smile, your eye contact, the positive and engaging way you kept the conversation going, and other aspects of your meeting that have nothing whatsoever to do with CRISPR-Cas9 or the size of your bioreactors.

1562,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"North Korea lifts lockdown in city, rejects flood, virus aid - Egypt Independent - Egypt Independent",https://egyptindependent.com/north-korea-lifts-lockdown-in-city-rejects-flood-virus-aid/,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lifted a lockdown in a major city near the border with South Korea where thousands had been quarantined for weeks over coronavirus worries, state media said Friday.

But Kim, during a key ruling party meeting on Thursday, also insisted the North will keep its borders shut and rejected any outside help as the country carries out an aggressive anti-virus campaign and rebuilds thousands of houses, roads and bridges damaged by heavy rain and floods in recent weeks.

Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency also said Kim replaced Kim Jae Ryong as premier following an evaluation of the Cabinet’s economic performance and appointed Kim Tok Hun as his successor.

Entering the last year of an ambitious five-year national development plan, Kim Jong Un in December declared a “frontal breakthrough” against international sanctions while urging his nation to stay resilient in a struggle for economic self-reliance.

But experts say the COVID-19 crisis likely thwarted some of Kim’s major economic goals by forcing the country into a lockdown that shut the border with China — the North’s major ally and economic lifeline — and potentially hampered his ability to mobilize people for labor.

During Thursday’s meeting, Kim said it was clear after three weeks of isolation measures and “scientific verification” that the virus situation in Kaesong was stable and expressed gratitude to residents for cooperating with the lockdown, KCNA reported.

Kim said his country now faces a dual challenge of fending off COVID-19 amid a worsening global pandemic and repairing damage from torrential rain that lashed the country in past weeks.

KCNA said 39,296 hectares (97,100 acres) of crops were ruined nationwide and 16,680 homes and 630 public buildings destroyed or flooded. It said many roads, bridges and railway sections were damaged and a dam of an unspecified power station gave way. There was no mention of any information related to injuries or deaths.

Kim expressed sympathy with people who were at temporary facilities after losing their houses to floods and called for swift recovery efforts so that none is “homeless” by the time the country celebrates the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s founding on Oct. 10.

“The situation, in which the spread of the worldwide malignant virus has become worse, requires us not to allow any outside aid for the flood damage but shut the border tighter and carry out strict anti-epidemic work,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying.

Kim’s public rejection of international aid for flood recovery and his decision to release Kaesong from quarantine are negative indicators for inter-Korean cooperation as South Korea had hoped to restart diplomatic engagement by providing support in these areas, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.

Cho Hey-sil, spokesperson of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said the South remains willing to provide humanitarian assistance to the North.

North Korea in past months has severed virtually all cooperation with the South amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, which faltered over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament steps.

The North in June blew up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, following months of frustration over Seoul’s unwillingness to defy US-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and restart joint economic projects that would help the North’s broken economy.

“The North Korean economy, while touting self-reliance, is increasingly dependent on China and will struggle to balance sanctions-busting efforts and COVID-19 prevention,” Easley said. “The job of North Korea’s new premier will be to show the country has recovered from recent flooding and has upgraded public health facilities” by the October party anniversary, he said.

In late July, Kim ordered a total lockdown of Kaesong and had the nation shift into a “maximum emergency system” after the North reported it found a person with COVID-19 symptoms.

The North’s state media said the suspected case was a North Korean who had earlier fled to the South before slipping back into Kaesong. But South Korean health authorities say the 24-year-old hadn’t tested positive in South Korea and never had contact with any known virus carrier.

North Korea later said the person’s test results were inconclusive and still maintains it is virus-free, a status widely doubted by outsiders. Some experts said the North was likely trying to shift the blame over a possible spread of the virus to South Korea.

In an email to The Associated Press last week, Dr. Edwin Salvador, the World Health Organization’s representative to North Korea, said the North has told the UN agency it quarantined 64 first contacts of the suspected Kaesong case and 3,571 secondary contacts in state-run facilities for 40 days.

Since the end of December, North Korea has quarantined and released 25,905 people, 382 of them foreigners, Salvador said.

A statement from the presidency said: “the State of Emergency exists on account of the natural disaster of drought in all regions of the Republic of Namibia.”

“Offices, Ministries and Agencies and all other stakeholders will be mobilized to ensure that the necessary assistance is rolled out to affected communities,” the statement added.

The government has this month confirmed that it will subsidise farmers who reduce their herds as part of its drought intervention.

The top official of the department of agricultural development, Sophia Kasheeta, is quoted by the Namibian news portal as saying the ministry will give marketing incentives to farmers who want to sell their livestock to encourage them to reduce the numbers.

Kasheeta added that they would pay N$80 per head of small stock, and N$400 per head of large stock sold. However, the ministry said the government will only pay the subsidy for up to 100 livestock units per farmer, the report added.

Other initiatives the ministry was implementing in the face of drought relief interventions was the provision of water tankers for communities with no alternative sources of water in all regions, except Khomas.

The water tankers will benefit 10 000 households. Except Khomas, the ministry will also rehabilitate and restore boreholes in all regions. Farmers adversely affected will also benefit from lick supplements.

Information minister Stanley Simataa is on record to have admitted that this is the worst drought the country has experienced. “It will be coming. It is in the process.

Digitisation could change the game for agriculture in Africa. That’s a key message in a report recently released by an international institution that enhances smallholder farming in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.

The Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) focuses on poverty reduction through modernising smallholder farming by fostering innovation and knowledge sharing.

Digitisation refers to everything from delivering farming advice via text messaging to interactive voice response. It also includes smart phone applications that link farmers to multimedia advisory content, farm inputs, and buyers. And it covers the use of drones and satellite systems to inform farmer activities, such as crops and times to plant; and types and amounts of inputs to use.

Other global organisations have echoed this message. These range from NGOs like Solidaridad Network – a civil society organisation that accelerates sustainable and inclusive development – to the World Bank. These organisations believe that digital technologies can create employment for young people in the agricultural sector, promote economic activity, and enhance food security.

For the past two decades, digitisation has steadily transformed African farming. In Ghana, for instance, online platforms such as Esoko, Farmerline, and Trotro Tractor have provided farmers with accessible services. These have included voice messages and SMS extension advice. This helps farmers obtain information about how to access markets and extension services.

Elsewhere on the continent, international organisations help provide precision advice to farmers. An example is the CTA’s ‘Transforming Africa’s agriculture: Eyes in the sky, smart techs on the ground"" project that supports the use of drones for agriculture.

The continent’s digital agriculture industry is growing. The number of farmers subscribed to digital services has grown by between 40% and 45% per year in the last three years.

Annual revenues from digitally supported farming are estimated at about $140 million. Services are provided by a small but growing number of providers — some of which are estimated to generate €90 of revenue per farmer annually, partly through service charges. This trend looks set to continue.

But the success of digitisation in agriculture shouldn’t just be evaluated by its economic value. Its benefits must be enjoyed by smallholder farmers and rural populations. Smallholder farmers, most of whom have access to less than two acres of land, produce more than 80% of the food in sub-Saharan Africa.

African smallholder farmers will ultimately determine the continent’s digital farming story. Only through collaborations with them, and among sectors, will the digital transformation become a success in Africa.

Challenges of smallholder farming

Smallholder farmers face daunting political, economic, social, cultural, and institutional barriers. They have limited access to information, markets, capital, land tenure, and even basic inputs like fertilisers and seeds.

Government policies, and the influx of foreign land grabbers in many African countries, only worsen the situation. Ethiopia, Ghana, and South Sudan are among the hot beds for foreign land deals.

Added to these are environmental issues like soil erosion and a changing climate. In recent years, droughts, rising temperatures, and El-Niño events left nearly thirteen million people from Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia needing humanitarian assistance.

This makes traditional farming hard for smallholders across the continent, and can undermine their capacity to fully benefit from the digital revolution.

Also, connectivity tends to be limited in rural areas. And, even if farmers can connect, they may not have enough money to access the services.

These concerns limit the production and profits of farmers and undermine rural development. This is where digitisation comes in. It has potential to increase access to information and resources to provide solutions.

Elsewhere, digital technologies are already showing promise for rural farmers. The Chinese government partners with private actors like Alibaba to digitise agriculture. From web-portals to Mobile Internet Based Services, rural farmers benefit from access extension advice and capital. This leads to increased productivity and incomes.

Inclusion in digitisation

There have been positive strides in ensuring smallholders become involved in digital agriculture. An estimated 33 million people – about 13% of all sub-Saharan African smallholders and pastoralists – are already registered for services such as weather updates and market linkages.

Ethiopia’s “80-28” hotline - a farmer advisory service - has about 4 million users, the highest on the continent. Beyond being a free service, its success is partly due to the delivery of services in local languages. Aligning services to local circumstances encourages farmers to subscribe willingly.

Kenya leads the way in digitisation in Africa. Collaborations between agriculture and telecommunication has been instrumental in their success so far.

What’s missing

These examples show what is necessary to help smallholders become connected to digital services.

One additional strategy is to blur the boundaries between different sectors. Digitisation is not just an agricultural issue, or a technological one. It involves many parts of the economy. Hence, digitisation must be situated within a broader development and poverty reduction agenda. For instance, education is critical to farmers’ ability to use and benefit from digital technologies.

It is also crucial to place smallholders front and centre when designing policies and specific digital products meant to help them. In this way, digital transformation will reflect the users’ needs.

844,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Pres Fulfilling Axim Landing Beach Project - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907250484.html,"Axim — The President, Nana Addo Dakwa Akufo-Addo, yesterday performed the ground ceremony for construction work to begin on the Axim Landing Beach project.

The ceremony, according to President Akufo-Addo, was in fulfilment of one of the campaign promises he made to the chiefs and people of Axim in 2016.

The President who was on his second day tour of the Western Region said he promised the chiefs and people of the Axim area during his campaign period that if he was voted as the president, he would make sure the landing beach was built for the fisher folks to have a good place to bring their catch on land.

The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Mrs Elizabeth Afoley Quaye, thanked the chiefs and people for their collaboration for a successful close season, saying the start of the project showed that the government was very much concerned about the fishing industry and the coastal areas.

She indicated that the project would bring about job creation and increase the food and nutritional values of the people of the area and the country at large.

According to her, infrastructural development was key to the development of the fishing industry, and advised the people to put an end to the use of wrong fishing gears and light to bring sanity to the industry.

The Omanhene of Axim, Awulae Attibrukusu III, noted that the project had been on the drawing board for years, adding that the ground breaking showed that President Akufo-Addo came to fulfil his campaign promise.

He bemoaned the state of the Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital, which never befitted the region, and pleaded with the president to build a new regional hospital for the Western Region.

President Akufo-Addo used the occasion to register his displeasure at the attack on the Omanhene of the Lower Dixcove Traditional Area, Nana Kwasi Agyemeng IX, by some unknown assailants, stressing it was most unfortunate, and asked the security agencies to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to book.

In a related development, the Chief of Sekyere Hemang, Nana Kwedukyerefuor II, thanked the president for the implementation of his government's Free Senior High School policy.

The policy, which was implemented in September 2017, had seen some 270,000 more students enrolled into senior high schools across the country in two academic years, with all students in senior high schools, from September 2019, set to be covered by the policy.

In his remarks to the president, Nana Kwedukyerefuor II stated that ""our children are determined to go to school, Nana Akufo-Addo, even if you don't do anything else, please do this. This free education policy you have implemented is of great value. You have done very well, and we know that you will do your best to do all the other things we also want.""

The Sekyere Hemang Omanhene was speaking at a durbar organised by the chiefs and people in honour of President Akufo-Addo as part of his two-day working visit that took him to the Wassa East district.

Nana Kwedukyerefuor II, told the gathering that, ""You (President Akufo-Addo) have impressed many people with your hard work, when there was dumsor, we could sleep in darkness for three days, but ever since you came into power, dumsor is no longer a problem because of your great leadership and the measures you have put in place.""

The chief continued, ""We humbly ask that you continue like that. There is so much that we can ask for, but we know that you are a busy man.

1101,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Report on the RIASCO Action Plan for the El Niño-induced drought in Southern Africa 2016/2017 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/report-riasco-action-plan-el-ni-o-induced-drought-southern-africa-20162017,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

El Niño conditions during the 2015/16 planting season caused Southern Africa’s worst drought in 35 years, representing a second consecutive failed harvest. This created severe food and water shortages and compounded existing vulnerabilities in all humanitarian sectors. While governments led the response, the scale of needs overwhelmed national capacity. Five countries declared national emergencies: Lesotho (22 December 2015), Zimbabwe (04 February 2016), Swaziland (18 February 2016) and Malawi (13 April 2016). Mozambique declared a Red Alert (12 April 2016), while Madagascar issued a message of solidarity (26 August 2016); All called for urgent international assistance.

Members of the Southern Africa Regional Inter-Agency Standing Committee (RIASCO) deployed staff to the Southern African Development Community’s (SADC)’s El Niño Logistics and Coordination Team (established in May 2016) to provide technical assistance. On 26 July 2016 SADC declared a regional emergency and launched a 13-country, US$2.4 billion appeal to assist 41 million El Niño-affected Southern Africans. In support of SADC’s appeal, RIASCO launched its Action Plan on 27 July, which was revised in December 2016. The Action Plan prioritized seven countries: Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.

The Action Plan was based on three pillars: a humanitarian pillar, setting out immediate needs in the seven priority countries; a resilience pillar undertaken in parallel to humanitarian efforts; and a macro-economic pillar, which sets out policy options for governments to address the long-term impacts. The plan requested $1.3 billion to provide humanitarian assistance (pillar 1) for 13.8 million people up to April 2017, of which $900 million has been received (70 per cent).

Critical funds from international donors including USAID, DFID, ECHO, CERF and the Governments of China and Japan enabled a significant humanitarian response, especially in stabilizing regional food security. National and international NGOs, as well as the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and local Red Cross societies, played an indispensable role in the response. With the concerted efforts of governments and the humanitarian community, more than 10.6 million people were reached with food assistance at the peak of the response (January to April 2017). More than 360,000 children under age 5 with acute malnutrition were admitted for treatment, and 1.5 million people were provided with safe water. Coordination among various partners enabled the provision of emergency education programming, such as school meals and life-saving messaging on hygiene practices. Education and Protection partners collaboratively achieved significant results for 451,000 children, demonstrating the key role the sectors play in promoting resilience and disaster risk reduction (DRR). With hopes pinned on an agricultural recovery, more than 1.6 million drought-affected households were reached with programmes to boost agricultural production.

With climate change predicted to bring more frequent and intense natural disasters to the region, the RIASCO Action Plan included a range of practical options to build resilience, based on the idea that while droughts cannot be prevented from occurring, they should not result in humanitarian emergencies. These options included the development of sound national policies and strategies, expanded and strengthened social safety nets, promotion of climate smart agriculture, reinforced early warning systems and improved management of water and other natural resources. These must be combined with solid risk management and fiscal instruments at national and regional levels. A $150 million World Bank project in Botswana to protect water sources is a current example; as well as the recent availability of longer term disaster risk insurance products.",2017-07-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['world', 'africa', 'response', 'plan', 'southern', 'national', 'humanitarian', 'regional', 'pillar', 'action', 'drought', 'report', 'el', 'million', 'riasco', '2016', 'niñoinduced', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
1457,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Where Canada sits with overland flood insurance - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/canada-sits-overland-flood-insurance-1004132703/,"Five years after massive flooding caused more than $4 billion in uninsured losses in Alberta, more than a dozen insurers representing about three-fourths of Canada’s property insurance market are now covering overland flood.

Sixteen insurers representing 77% of the market now offer overland flood coverage, Craig Stewart, vice president of federal affairs for Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in a recent interview.

In 2015, Aviva Canada, The Co-operators and RSA Canada were among the first insurers to announce they would cover overland flood. Until then, only sewer backup was generally available. The 2013 southern Alberta floods led to economic losses of about $6 billion, but only about $1.7 billion of that was covered by insurance (mostly sewer backup).

Water damage coverage is still a concern because overland flood is not available at affordable rates to hundreds of thousands of Canadian homeowners, mainly because they live in areas deemed by insurers to be at a high risk of flooding, Stewart told Canadian Underwriter.

IBC is not naming all 16 carriers offering overland flood. Those who publicly advertise it include Aviva, The Co-operators, RSA, Gore Mutual, Wawanesa, Economical, Desjardins (whose brands in Canada include State Farm and The Personal), Intact, and Coachman.

Flood coverage was among the topics of conversation during a meeting of politicians on May 25. That meeting was co-chaired by federal public safety minister Ralph Goodale and Alberta municipal affairs minister Shaye Anderson.

Ministers attending that meeting asked IBC to “continue to further refine options for managing the financial costs of high-risk properties,” including drawing from international practices such as Flood Re in Britain, a Public Safety Canada spokesperson wrote Tuesday in an e-mail to Canadian Underwriter.

IBC recommended earlier that Canada have insurance for homes at high risk of flood where the coverage is administered by insurers but the capital is provided by government.

“It remains to be determined what the mechanism would look like,” Stewart said. “We don’t believe that low-risk insurance policyholders should be subsidizing those who have been permitted to continue living in harm’s way.”

Contacted by Canadian Underwriter, Public Safety Canada would not confirm whether the federal government agrees that it should provide capital for flood risk for high-risk properties.

Flood Re, a reinsurer subsidized by a tax imposed on all carriers writing home insurance in Britain, was launched two years ago.",2018-06-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['coverage', 'sits', 'risk', 'safety', 'stewart', 'canada', 'overland', 'canadian', 'flood', 'insurers', 'insurance']",Canada,news article,English
434,DR-2021-000022-AFG,REACHING OUT - Implementing a Comprehensive Response to Drought in Afghanistan - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/reaching-out-implementing-comprehensive-response-drought-afghanistan,"NGOs call for comprehensive response to Drought in Afghanistan:

4th July 2018, Kabul, Afghanistan

Afghanistan remains one of the worst funded of the large crises around the world. Millions of people are in need of humanitarian assistance, mostly due to conflict, rapid-onset natural disasters and situations of protracted displacement. So far this year only 29% of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) is funded; but on top of the initial response plan, a drought is further escalating needs.

Below average precipitation since October 2017, has destroyed and degraded agriculture and livelihoods, significantly increasing the number of people in need. For example, in Kandiwal, a village of 300 families in Ghor province, only 15 families had cultivated their crop this year. At least 40 families from there had already moved to Herat, joining at least 2,000 drought-displaced families. In the North and NorthEastern regions, only 68% of rain-fed land cultivated last year was cultivated this year and the price of goats is almost two times less compared to the previous year. Approximately 30% of the population of Chakhansoor district, Nimroz, have abandoned their villages because they were unable to meet their basic needs, moving towards the already overpopulated provincial capital of Zaranj, across the border into Iran, or towards Europe, where they face increased protection risks.

The situation for those who have already been displaced by drought and conflict is dire. Many lack access to safe drinking water, shelter or adequate sanitation facilities and diseases such as diarrhoea, as well as malnutrition, are widespread among drought-induced IDPs. Greater leadership from the clusters, particularly at a field level, is required to address this situation.

Whilst resource mobilisation to address these immediate needs has started, the current levels of funding are likely to be insufficient to meet growing needs – especially if more people displace. As such, in addition to providing necessary emergency assistance to IDPs, the aid community must structure the response in a way that ensures both the immediate and longer-term needs of drought-affected communities in their areas of origin are equally addressed. Thereby providing drought-affected communities in their areas of origin with equal access to assistance and helping prevent further forced displacement.

In addition to emergency assistance, resources are required for early recovery and resilience to provide sustainable livelihoods for communities in their areas of origin. The current drought is likely to cause a protracted crisis. The negative impact of the drought on harvests will deprive many families of income and sustenance until the next harvest season and potentially beyond as many families, who have not cultivated this season, will lack seeds to plant for the next harvest – effectively creating a vicious cycle of deprivation for the years to come. Without this investment, the situation for drought affected communities is likely to become more protracted, negatively impacting future harvests, discouraging those already displaced from returning and may cause a further drift into urban centres and provincial capitals increasing the strain on resources on local communities as well as displaced households.

Currently linkages between the mobilised resources for emergency response and longer-term resilience, early recovery and development interventions are severely lacking. Humanitarian and Development donors must work together to strengthen these links and ensure adequate resources for long-term support in response to the drought. In particular, development actors must be engaged from the very beginning of the response to ensure that their investments in agricultural and community-based development projects continue and receive extra-attention to ensure they are sensitive to the impact of the drought. In addition, given the protracted nature of this crisis, the need to promote early-recovery and resilience should be reflected in Humanitarian programme cycle planning and annual updates to the 2018-2021 HRP.

The response must be guided by the principle of ‘Do No Harm’. Emergency assistance to droughtinduced IDPs should be a last resort. Without the additional assistance to drought-affected communities in their areas of origin – humanitarian assistance to IDPs risks becoming a pull factor and encouraging further displacement. This displacement has already caused additional protection concerns linked with the inability to access safe shelter, the lack of safe water, the absence of adequate sanitation facilities. In addition, several incidents of violence and increased tensions between host communities and IDPs have occurred in cities such as Qal-e-Naw, Badghis and Injil, Herat. It is therefore important to involve both host communities and IDPs, from the beginning of any response and where necessary allocate a proportion of resources to target particularly vulnerable host families.

Drought-induced displacement has also increased the protection issues faced by those who have remained in their villages. In Nimroz, up to 30% of males have left their villages to find work in Zaranj or Iran. Without a male family member to act as their Mahram (Guardian), many women and children have decreased mobility in their day to day lives due to existing cultural norms that do not allow for women and children to travel without a male companion, which means that in some cases, they are unable to access medical treatment should they need it. A targeted response in areas affected by drought is required in order to minimise the risk of creating a ‘pull factor’ for displacement, decrease further strain on local communities in urban centres as well as the IDPs themselves, and support those potentially unable to leave drought stricken areas.

Finally, an enabling operating environment is required in order to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of drought-affected communities. Humanitarian access continues to be an issue in many provinces of Afghanistan. All actors, including Non-State Armed Groups (NSAGs), must facilitate safe and unhindered access to communities affected by the drought. In addition, NGOs currently face a number of bureaucratic constraints in the implementation of their response to ongoing needs in Afghanistan resulting from conflict, displacement and natural disasters. In particular, the complexity of the current MOU process leads to significant delays in the implementation of current programmes. Given the critical situation, humanitarian actors should be exempt from this process in adherence to article 23 of the NGO law, to operate in lieu of a MOU when a humanitarian crisis such as drought requires immediate, independent, and effective response.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Humanitarian and Development actors must work together to produce a comprehensive, protectionsensitive response strategy to the drought, in both areas of displacement and origin, to respond to the emergency and to support early return and recovery, as well as resilience-building, to be integrated into the multi-year HRP update this year. Donor resources must be made available accordingly Protection risks must be adequately analysed and responded to, through both host and displaced community participation, to prevent recourse into harmful coping strategies, including resorting to irregular immigration into Iran and beyond Cluster Lead Agencies must demonstrate greater leadership, particularly at a field level, to take prompt action by better coordinating responses and more clearly understanding needs, and effectively dealing with potential obstruction from local and national stakeholders.

Food access remains constrained due to the extremely high staple food prices, and this is projected to continue until the harvest in March 2017.

WFP has scaled up its ongoing El Niño drought response. In November, WFP reached a total 554,445 beneficiaries, while working to enhance the resilience to climate shocks in the longer term.

In Numbers

Operational Update:

Food for Assets and General Food Distributions (FFA/GFD):

A total 457,110 people were reached during the month of November equivalent to 72% of the total caseload as per the signed Field Level Agreements (FLAs). WFP’s response was affected by limited availability of food commodities from regional source markets. As harvests were poor and in many parts failed altogether, the region’s supply chain was faced with significant challenges.

At various intervals during the month of November, some transporters were unwilling to serve parts of Sofala and Manica due to political-military activities in the region.

WFP is enhancing its field presence and up to 18 staff will be deployed as part the second wave of surge staff recruitment for FFA/GFD to cover new districts and vacant field posts.",2016-11-30 08:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'response', 'wfps', 'month', 'report', 'wfp', 'food', 'situation', 'staff', 'working', 'total', 'reached', 'parts', '2016', 'field']",Mozambique,news article,English
2428,FL-2017-000067-BRA,"Floods, Drought Are Destroying Crops and Sparking Food Inflation - Claims Journal",https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/international/2020/10/23/300118.htm,"Wild weather is wreaking havoc on crops around the world, sending their prices skyrocketing.

On wheat farms in the U.S. and Russia, it’s a drought that’s ruining harvests. The soybean fields of Brazil are bone dry too, touched by little more than the occasional shower. In Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the problem is the exact opposite. Torrential downpours are causing flooding in rice fields and stands of oil palm trees.

The sudden emergence of these supply strains is a big blow to a global economy that has been struggling to regain its footing after the shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. As prices soar on everything from sugar to cooking oil, millions of working-class families that had already been forced to scale back food purchases in the pandemic are being thrust deeper into financial distress.

What’s more, these increases threaten to push up broader inflation indexes in some countries and could make it harder for central bankers to keep providing monetary stimulus to shore up growth.

The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index, a gauge of nine crop prices, has risen 28% since late April to its highest level in more than four years. Wheat earlier this week was the most expensive since 2014.

“The fundamentals have changed dramatically since May,” said Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities in Iowa. “The weather is bubbling to the top, and we have demand chugging in a bull market.”

The fallout from the pandemic means that the United Nations was already warning of a worst-case scenario in which about a tenth of the world’s population would go hungry this year. Things could become more dire if grocery costs keep rising and even more people can’t afford to eat.

“It’s looking very bleak,” said David Beasley, executive director at the World Food Programme, the hunger-fighting group that won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Declining currencies in food-importing nations, the threat of more economic shutdowns and struggles for farmers to expand production could all compound the problem, he said.

“You start adding all these things together and you begin to almost run around like, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’ but it ain’t chicken little,” Beasley said.

Mangled supply chains and a flood of buying already sent food prices higher in many countries earlier this year as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted global trade. But even then, there was an ample cushion of grain stockpiles and Northern Hemisphere harvests were expected to be bountiful. Then came the dry weather.

Climate scientists have long warned that an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather patterns would be a growing threat to crop production and food security. Now, we are experiencing what it means to be living in a climate-disrupted world as wildfires blaze across the U.S. West, hurricane season grows more ferocious and forecasters say that 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record.

Antonio Carlos Simoneti, a fourth-generation orange grower in Brazil, is seeing the change firsthand. With drought and heat plaguing his lands in Sao Paulo state, the world’s top region for orange juice production, the river that usually snakes across his property has vanished. That’s the first time that’s happened since his family acquired the farm 36 years ago. Oranges on his 500-hectare (1,236-acre) grove are drying up inside and becoming crystallized, as the trees suck all the water from the fruit to try to survive the parched conditions.

After making some sales earlier in the season, “I don’t have more fruits to sell,” said Simoneti, who expects his harvest to drop about 50% this year because of the weather. “What remains on the trees are dried, without water inside.”

Shopping Spree

It’s not just the weather sparking higher crop prices.

Agricultural commodity buyers from Cairo to Islamabad have been on a shopping spree as nations try to protect themselves from more disruptions to supply chains, like those seen earlier this year when lockdowns left food stranded at ports, sparked trucking delays and created logjams at warehouses.

A weaker real is boosting prices even further in agriculture superpower Brazil, where soybeans are up 81% and corn 56% this year, also raising costs for chicken and pork production. As an emergency measure, local government has temporarily removed import tariffs for soybeans, corn, rice and wheat to control food inflation.

Jordan has built up record wheat reserves while Egypt, the world’s top buyer of the grain, took the unusual step of tapping international markets during its local harvest and has boosted purchases by more than 50% since April. Taiwan said it will increase strategic food stockpiles and China has been buying to feed its growing hog herd.

The last protracted runup in food prices back in 2011 helped contribute to uprisings in the Arab Spring. That said, prices have a long way to climb before reaching those levels. Also, a bumper crop in Australia may help to fill the supply gap.

That growth in demand helps to explain why prices are moving higher despite a still-hefty inventory cushion. Global reserves of wheat, for example, are forecast to reach a record this year. Those supplies could eventually help to bring food inflation back in check if concerns over weather problems start to die down.

That would be welcome relief for people like Doan Cam Chi, a Ho Chi Minh City working mom. She estimated she’s spent about 30% more on food bills this year for her 5-member family. She’s seen pork prices decrease this month, but things like rice, cereals and fruits are still up from last year.

“I just can’t trim food expenses as my kids are in their growing years,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a market in the city, 50-year-old produce seller Le Thi Giang was just an hour away from closing on a recent morning, but her stall was still full of unsold spinach, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans and carrots. Ongoing torrential rains and flooding in key growing areas mean that prices for fruit and vegetables are fetching as much as double what they were pre-pandemic. At these higher costs, many people can’t afford to buy what they need for a healthy diet, she said.

“I have to call and invite people into my stall, something I had never done before,” said Giang, who has been selling at the market for two decades.

The recovery in prices after years in the doldrums has been welcome news for farmers in the U.S., who have relied more on government aid to balance the loss of income due to tariffs and trade wars.

“To see demand be so strong right now for a lot of commodities is a welcome sign,” Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, who grows corn and soybeans in southwest Iowa, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Right now exports are just on fire.”

JOHANNESBURG -- An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.

Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.

""We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,"" said Nellie Nyang'wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.

""The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.""

Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.

Zambia's rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.

Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.

Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.

""The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn't enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,"" said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.

""This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.""

Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.

The drought has also affected the region's wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe's National Parks.

828,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Ten Fish Landing Sites to Be Constructed Soon - Vice President Bawumia - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907080387.html,"Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia has given firm indication that government will soon build ten fish landing sites along the coastal areas of Ghana for the benefit of fishing communities.

The Vice President of the Republic, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia made the announcement on Saturday, 6th July, when he joined the people of Elmina to celebrate the 2019 Edina Bakatue festival to mark the beginning of a fishing season.

Celebrated under the theme, ""Buy made in Ghana goods; use goods made in Ghana and promote jobs for the youth"", Dr. Bawumia lauded the paramount chief of Elmina, Nana Kodwo Conduah VI, and the chiefs and people of Elmina, saying that the theme for this year's celebration was timely because it is line with President Akufo-Addo's vision of building a Ghana Beyond Aid, where we harness internal resources for the development of our country.

Addressing the durbar, Vice President Bawumia said the government's inclusive development agenda is designed to improve the quality of life of all Ghanaians regardless of geographical, religious or ethnic affiliations.

Currently at Elmina, sod has been cut for work to start on the Elmina Heritage Bay project. The first phase of this project is currently ongoing with enhanced durbar grounds and a reverential garden under construction.

Touching on the fish landing sites Dr. Bawunia stated that ""as part of the broader government agenda to provide fish landing sites along the coastal communities, funding for ten such fish landing sites has been secured and works shall begin soon. The ten sites where the landing sites and related facilities will be constructed include: Teshie in the Greater Accra Region, Axim and Dixcove in the Western Region, Elmina, Winneba, Mumford, Senya-Bereku, Fetteh-Gomoah and Moree in the Central Region and Keta in the Volta Region.""

""Measures to protect the coastline from the erosive effects of the sea has led to government constructing sea defense walls along the coast"".

""The Navy and Marine Police are also being assisted to beef up patrols to ensure that perpetrators of illegal fishing are dealt with, Vice President Bawumia indicated"", he added.

Dr. Bawumia urged Edinaman to take advantage of the numerous social interventions introduced by the Akufo-Addo government.

""I urge the people of Elmina to take advantage of the interventions provided under the Planting for Food and Jobs, Rearing for Food and jobs and Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) programmes:

""To my gallant farmers, in our effort to produce more let us not forget about the future generations. We must do everything possible to protect and preserve our environment for their use"" he said.

""Chainsaw operations remain a serious threat to the environment. The uncontrolled use of pesticides and weedicides is also a serious threat to the environment and our health. I urge our Agriculture officers to intensify the education on use of the chemicals."" Vice President Bawumia added.

The Vice President was grateful to the people for the cooperation from all stakeholders and assured them of government's continous effort to have such collaboration in many other fields in a mutually beneficial manner.

On behalf of his people, Nana Kodwo Conduah VI, Omanhen of Edina Traditional Area, praised the government for the Elmina Heritage Bay Tourism Project and called for all to unite to accelerate development in Elmina.

He also commended President Akufo-Addo for the numerous social interventions introduced in the past two and a half years.",2019-07-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['vice', 'president', 'landing', 'sites', 'fish', 'development', 'soon', 'constructed', 'bawumia', 'dr', 'ghana', 'elmina']",Ghana,news article,English
9,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Drought conditions plague Aandhra Pradesh almost every 5 years - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Drought-conditions-plague-Aandhra-Pradesh-almost-every-5-years/articleshow/40018979.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM/ HYDERABAD: Even as the two states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana continue to reel from a rainfall deficit this monsoon, weathermen say it is in keeping with the pattern of a drought-like situation every five years in the state of unified AP. Rainfall received so far by the two states during the ongoing southwest monsoon seems to be only lending more credence to this theory. Though the southwest monsoon season usually arrives around June 1, this year its onset was announced only on June 19 by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), but the rainfall began in earnest only in the second week of July.

According to K Sitaram, director, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad centre, drought conditions have been reported in 1982, 1987, 2002, 2004, 2009 and now in 2014 in AP. ""Except for 2002 and 2004, and the 1990's the gap between two consecutive droughts in AP has been five years,"" Sitaram said.

""Comparing the rainfall as on August 9 of 2013 and 2014, it was deficient this year whereas it was excess in Telangana and normal in Andhra Pradesh last year. The main reasons behind the situation include the weak monsoon and unfavorable low pressures in the Bay of Bengal. Four low pressures formed in the Bay in July and one in the first week of August had no impact in the two states,"" Sitaram said.

The nine districts of coastal Andhra Pradesh should have received 305.6 mm rainfall as on Saturday in the ongoing monsoon season (June 1 to August 9), but received only 194.8 mm, resulting in a deficiency of 36%. Similarly, the four Rayalaseema districts should have received 189.5 mm rainfall in the season, but received only 135.7 mm, registering a 28% deficiency. However, the 10 districts of Telangana witnessed the highest deficiency of 49% in the season by receiving only 221.5 mm rainfall against its normal rainfall of 436.7 mm.

While Sitaram said the deficient rainfall this year was bound to have a negative impact on agriculture, power generation and drinking water supply, he was unable to pinpoint the reasons behind this peculiar pattern. ""We are unable to pin down the reasons behind the periodic drought conditions in AP. Earlier we had assumed that droughts prevailed due to the impact of the El Nino, a prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean surface temperatures as compared to the average values. However, that assumption did not hold true for some droughts because there was no El Nino effect observed in those years. Now, we are studying the presence of any negative phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or Indian Nino, which is an irregular oscillation of sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean. The negative phase causes cooler sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean as compared to the east part of ocean,"" Sitaram said.

Meanwhile, other senior weathermen from the Cyclone Warning Centre (CWC), Visakhapatnam, said this year's monsoon witnessed hot weather conditions. The temperatures also remained higher over the past five days due to clear skies. On Sunday, Rentachintala registered a maximum temperature of 38.8 degree Celsius against its normal of 35 degree Celsius, Tirupati clocked 38.4 degree Celsius, Machilipatnam 37 degree Celsius and Visakhapatnam Airport registered 34.8 degree Celsius against its normal of 33 degree Celsius, the CWC officials added.

Iran is currently facing its worst drought in fifty years, with nearly half the population likely to face severe water shortages. The situation in Afghanistan is also dire, with a 60 per cent shortfall in rain and snow during winter; a drought emergency has been declared in several parts of the country. The availability of water per capita is expected to decline by 50 per cent over the next three decades. Afghanistan’s inferior infrastructure has left it with one of the lowest water-storage capacities in the world and large parts of the country cannot effectively use their allocated water resources. In light of this situation, the decision by the Afghan Government to build several dams along the Helmand River has raised tensions with Iran over water allocation, at a time when both countries need every drop.

While there is a bilateral water-sharing agreement between the two countries, the 1973 Helmand River Treaty, it has been ineffective in resolving this dispute; both sides accuse the other of failing to meet their obligations. Iran is haunted by memories of the Taliban closing the sluices of the Kajaki dam in 1998-2001, an action that cut off the water usually supplied to Iran. Iran complains that the Afghans are cultivating more land in Helmand by using Iran’s share. On the other side of the dispute, Afghan officials believe that Iran receives significantly more than the agreed amount and has been providing support to Taliban militants to disrupt the construction of water infrastructure.

Comment

Iran and Afghanistan have generally maintained close relations since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Water allocations, however, have been a source of tension for decades, flaring up periodically in times of drought and hardship. Currently, both countries are suffering from significant droughts; consequently, the issue of sharing water has become highly politicised.

For Afghanistan, dams are an essential tool for both irrigation and electricity generation. They provide a much-needed boost to the agricultural sector and reduce its dependence on electricity imports from neighbouring countries. Currently, only one-third of the water that originates in Afghanistan is used inside the country, the rest flows into Iran and Pakistan. Iran, however, fears that any reduction in the flow of water from Afghanistan could have detrimental economic and environmental effects, as it is reliant on the flow of the Helmand River to meet its water needs.

A speech given by the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, in July 2017 led to demonstrations in Afghan cities and uproar on social media. Many interpreted his statement as a threat of retaliation if Afghanistan continued to build more dams. In a response to those events, the Iranian ambassador to Afghanistan claimed that President Rouhani’s speech was misinterpreted; he rejected any accusations that Tehran had disrupted Kabul’s water projects.

Regardless of whether those accusations are true, Afghanistan plans to build more dams, which is likely to result in weaker relations with Iran. While the development of dams is necessary for Afghan agriculture and industry, Kabul needs to maintain dialogue with Tehran on water sharing, as Iran has a right to its share of the water originating in Afghanistan.

The first step to resolving the water dispute is to record reliable data on the flow and distribution of water between Afghanistan and Iran. Despite claims in the media, there has been no accurate measurement of how much water enters Iran via the Helmand River since Soviet forces destroyed a measuring station built by the United States in the 1970s. The importance of reliable data cannot be understated, as monitoring the quantity of water flowing into Iran will allow both countries to better abide by the terms of the 1973 Helmand River Treaty.

The second step is to improve existing water management practices. Both countries have a history of building dams, digging wells and diverting the flow of water without conducting environmental surveys. They have also planted crops that are not suitable for the changing climate. Domestic water use in Iran is about 70 per cent higher than the global average, despite 87 per cent of Iranian water resources being over exploited, mostly through drilling and an over-reliance on dams.

Finally, the terms of the 1973 Treaty should be revised to reflect the current situation. That would help to create a framework to resolve future disputes over water and build a basis for future co-operation on the use of water resources.

With water becoming an increasingly politicised issue in both Iran and Afghanistan, however, it is doubtful that the water dispute will be resolved any time soon. The Afghan population has called on its government to continue building more dams, despite significant opposition from Iran. Consequently, in the immediate future, relations are likely to remain tense.",2018-08-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['flow', 'resources', 'water', 'dams', 'iran', 'drought', 'helmand', 'dispute', 'afghanistan', 'river', 'afghan', 'iranafghan', 'intensifies', 'countries']",Afghanistan,news article,English
610,Drought Sri Lanka,"With no Monsoon Rains, Drought-like Situation Grips Andhra Pradesh | The Weather Channel - Articles from The Weather Channel | weather.com - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/en-IN/india/monsoon/news/2019-06-17-with-no-monsoon-rains-drought-like-situation-grips-andhra-pradesh,"File photo: Locals walk miles to fetch water after the river beds went dry in Andhra Pradesh, India (Suman Reddy D/BCCL/Andhra Pradesh)

Andhra Pradesh is witnessing unrelenting heat, depleting ground water, fall in reservoir levels as the delayed and sluggish monsoon has left the fields parched and farmers worried.

With no sign of arrival of the southwest monsoon any time soon and maximum temperatures still hovering over 43 degrees Celsius at many places, the state is reeling under the longest and harshest summer in recent times.

The rainfall deficit for the current month is at 64.4 per cent. The deficit in the coastal region comprising nine districts and known for its fertile land is 57 per cent and it is even higher in four districts of Rayalaseema, notorious for recurring droughts.

The drought-like situation last week drove a farmer in Prakasam district of coastal Andhra to commit suicide. Addanki Venkateshwara Raju, 67, killed himself as all the 15 bores he dug on his 4.67 acre land had failed. He had a debt burden of over Rs 2.50 lakh. The situation has also created fodder shortage. Farmers in districts like Nellore and Prakasam are struggling to get fodder for their livestock.

The unusual long dry spell has also led to water scarcity. People in towns like Vizianagaram, Ongole, Giddaluru and Kadapa are getting piped drinking water once in four to five days. The tankers deployed by authorities too are proving insufficient to meet the demand. As many as 20 towns are getting water once in two or three days. Officials have said if there are no rains by month end the situation may worsen.

There is a shortfall of 453 million liters of drinking water in urban areas every day. In 110 urban areas, there are 12.50 lakh tap connections. Authorities are currently supplying 1,378 million liters of water per day against the requirement of 1,831 million liters. Last year's drought has also contributed to the water supply situation this year. As many as 38 reservoirs had dried up completely in April.

The present water storage in major reservoirs was 171.11 TMC as of June 15 against 193.43 TMC same day last year.

Underground water table has also depleted by an average 2.80 metres. In Rayalaseema, it has depleted by 7.26 metres. Borewells dug up to even 150 feet have dried up.

Advertisement Southwest monsoon normally arrives in the state in the first week of June but this time there is a delay. The monsoon arrived on Kerala coast on June 8 and was expected to enter Andhra Pradesh on June 13. The weatherman said that unless cyclone Vayu in the Arabian Sea weakens completely, the southwest monsoon is likely to remain sluggish. With no pre-monsoon or monsoon rains, the state is still reeling under heatwave conditions.

Vepada in Vizianagaram on Saturday recorded the highest temperature of 46.8 degrees Celsius. Tangutur in Prakasam district was the hottest on Sunday with a maximum temperature of 45.8 degrees Celsius.

According to Real Times Governance Society (RTGS) of Andhra Pradesh, temperature above 43 degrees was recorded in 42 places on Sunday. The maximum temperature in many places is five to six degrees above the normal.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned that heatwave conditions will prevail in the state over the next few days. It has also issued a warning of severe heatwave conditions at isolated places.

With no respite in sight, the government has extended half-day schools till June 22. The education department has asked school managements to strictly adhere to the half-day timings from 8 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.

As a result of continuing heat, the electricity consumption has increased. It was 194.21 million units in the entire state on June 14 against 168.14 million units the same day last year.

Farmers growing maize, tur and cotton were advised to delay the sowing of the crops till second week of June. With no rains even in the second and third week of June, the sowing operations have gotten further delayed. Paddy and chilli farmers in south coastal Andhra were worried. Last year too they suffered losses due to lack of timely rains.

Of the 13 districts only Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari are canal-irrigated. The rest of the state depends on rain-fed agriculture. The conditions have badly hit the tenant farmers, whose numbers in the state are estimated to be 16 lakh. Many complained about the delay in getting bank loans.

Last year, 347 blocks were declared drought-affected in nine of 13 districts. The state received 32 per cent deficient rainfall between June 2018 and April 2019, affecting kharif and rabi crops.",2019-06-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['million', 'state', 'droughtlike', 'andhra', 'situation', 'week', 'monsoon', 'grips', 'water', 'temperature', 'districts', 'degrees', 'rains', 'pradesh']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Almost 80,000 of the internally displaced persons are living in Kabul, said Sayed Hussain Alemi Balkhi, the Minister of Refugees and Repatriation.

Balkhi said drought has displaced residents of 20 provinces in the recent years.

“We have 52 camps for displaced families in different parts of Kabul. Nearly 10,000 displaced families are living in these camps. The total number of the displacedpersons in Kabul is between 70,000 to 80,000,” said Balkhi.

Some displaced families from Nangarhar said they are faced with “numerous challenges”.

“Clashes are ongoing in our district. There is no one to collect, transfer and bury those who lose their lives in the clashes. We are faced with various problems at the moment,” said Mohammad Ali, an internally displaced person from Nangarhar’s Achin district.

Ezor Khan, a resident of Achin district, said insecurity forced them to leave their homes two times.

“Achin residents are facing with lots of problems imposed by Daesh. A number of people had to go to mountains to collect bushes of pine nuts, but Daesh fighters killed them. Now no one dares to bring the bodies down to the village,” said Khan.

Ziar Khan, 10, member of a displaced family from Nangarhar, said he has bad memories from the clashes in Achin district. He said he continues his education in Kabul to make his future.

“We are tired of war. We want peace and want to live in a peaceful environment,” said Ziar Khan.

A report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that an estimated 253,600 people are currently displaced from drought affected areas across the Western Region.

The report says that 2.2 million people have been affected by drought in Afghanistan.

According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian AffairS (OCHA), recently 120,000 people have been displaced only in Badghis province due to droughts.

Among displaced families in the provinces of the Western Region, the situation is even more dire with 82 percent of the families having a poor food consumption score and 72 per cent having had to resort to negative coping mechanisms like reducing food intake or the number of meals, according to the Drought Impact and Needs Assessment (DINA) conducted by OCHA, UNDP and partners.",2019-10-14 07:43:44+00:00,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'western', 'drought', 'kabul', '300000', 'district', 'residents', 'number', 'families', 'achin', 'united', 'displace', 'insecurity']",Afghanistan,news article,English

I am privileged to be given this opportunity to present the Second H.R. Khanna Memorial Lecture.

I remember the days of Emergency when we, the public, were very unaware of what was happening as there was total censorship of newspapers.

During the height of emergency, the people of the country were wholly unaware of what was happening in regard to the challenges which would have an impact upon the future of the country. During these times, I myself had appeared in various political detention matters in the Karnataka High Court and in matters such as the dismissal of the Karunanidhi Government on 31st January, 1976 just before the General Elections were to be held in Tamil Nadu State, really with intention of eliminating the political rival in the State. If any attempt was made by newspaper to publish any of the news relating to challenges to the Central Government, the censure would straightway cut it out and there would be a white blank triangle, square or rectangle where the news would appear. Where the newspaper enclosed a blank square in a black border depicting important news, the censure would have even the black border removed.

It was in this atmosphere of fear that one person stood out in defence of the Constitution and for the liberty of the individual. It was Justice H.R. Khanna who was prepared to declare in his dissent that notwithstanding the suspension of the Right to Life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution or the Right to Equality in Article 14 of the Constitution or the various freedoms contained in Article 19 of the Constitution, nevertheless no person could be detained without authority of law or contrary to law.

When this judgment was delivered, Justice H.R. Khanna had no doubt, whatsoever, that though he was the senior-most Judge, he would stand superseded, but, nevertheless he went ahead and delivered his dissent. As expected, he was superseded, and he straightway submitted his resignation as a Judge of the Supreme Court.

I was in Madras at the time when my friends at the Bar in Delhi informed me about this great Judge who had upheld, during the time of Emergency, the human values which permeate the Justice delivery system. The New York Times, in its issue of 30th April 1976 declared:

If India ever finds its way back to the freedom and democracy that were proud hallmarks of its first eighteen years as an independent nation, someone will surely erect a monument to Justice H.R. Khanna of the Supreme Court.

No statue was put up in the Supreme Court, but in Court No.2, a life size portrait of his was put up so that even now, the new generation of advocates would notice it and ask who it is. They would then be told the entire history of his battle to uphold the basic human rights enshrined in the Constitution even though the fundamental rights to life and to equality had been suspended during the Emergency.

Almost a quarter of a century later, it is but fitting that we remember Justice Khanna’s legacy through this commemorative lecture of the Indian Institute of Public Administration on “The Rule of Law and Human Rights in India”. Both “Rule of Law” and “Human Rights” are familiar phrases, which all of us have often heard, but when we delve into the subject, we find that different thinkers and jurists have understood them in a variety of different ways. Justice H.R. Khanna himself, in his autobiography titled “Neither Roses nor Thorns” - a clear reference to another great Judge, late Justice M.C. Chagla, the title of whose autobiography was “Roses in December” - mentioned that:

If there are three prime requisites for the rule of law, they are a strong Bar, an independent judiciary and an enlightened public opinion. There can, indeed be no greater indication of decay in the rule of law than a docile Bar, a subservient judiciary and a society with a choked or coarsened conscience.

The Indian Parliament has also defined Human Rights, in The Protection of Human Rights Act 1993, to mean:

The rights relating to life and liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by Courts in India.

The International covenants which would be relevant for the purpose would be the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which, as proclaimed by the United Nations in 1948, in Article 1, itself sums up the basic doctrine on which Human Rights are founded, namely: all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”

The Declaration includes various civil and political rights, which we find enshrined in Part-III of our Constitution which was adopted the year after the Universal Declaration (the Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26th November 1949). However, in addition to these basic civil and political rights, it has also incorporated in Part-IV of the Constitution what are generally viewed as ‘socio-economic rights’. For instance, it is expressly stated in Article 23 of the Declaration that “everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment; everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work; everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.” Again, Article 25 of the Declaration states that “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age.” Under Article 26, “Everyone has the right to education which shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages”. And finally, Article 8 of the Declaration speaks of “Access to justice for enforcement of these fundamental rights”.

Many of these socio-economic rights found in the Universal Declaration like, the right to work, to education, to live, to nutrition, standard of living and all adequate means of livelihood are all found in our Constitution in the Directive Principles of State Policy which, in terms of Article 37 of the Constitution, as stated - “are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws”.

However, if one were to dispassionately consider the ground reality, one would find a very different and stark picture. Even though 60 years have elapsed since the adoption of the Constitution, we are faced with the grim reality of over 30% of the population of this country being subjected to dire poverty. India is crippled, in my view, by staggering poverty, which results in grave hunger, malnutrition and disease. While the rule of law may have come to be accepted as part of the basic structure of our constitutional system, to my mind, it is difficult to argue that the rule of law is a core value so long as millions of Indians are not free from want. Poverty in India constitutes, at the most fundamental level, a denial of the rule of law. The reality is that the Constitution’s promise of equality rings hollow for an unconscionably large section of Indian society even today.

It is true that we are fed, on an almost daily basis, with the idea of an India that is fast emerging as an economic powerhouse. No less a person than the President of the United States, on his recent visit to India, had remarked, in his address to the India Parliament that “India is not simply emerging. India,” he said, “has already emerged.” This statement was greeted with enthusiasm and self-congratulation in wide sections of the media and by the public. One may not have to look very far to see what inspired the U.S. President to say these words: a clutch of high-profile, high-value acquisitions of foreign firms by Indian companies, with just the top ten high value acquisitions so far being worth around USD 21.5 billion which is more than double the amount involved in the acquisitions of Indian companies by American companies; foreign direct investment in India, till November 2010, totaling to USD 140 billion; and an average quarterly GDP growth rate of 8.4% for the period 2004 – 2010, reaching a high of 10.10% in September 2006. India’s economy, as one article put it, has had its head in the clouds (As India’s clout grows it will reshape the world around it, The Economist, 29 September 2008).

This headline-grabbing growth unfortunately masks a quite different reality. A few kilometres beyond the plush five-star luxury and swanky board-rooms that the U.S. President visited in Bombay, is a rusty sprawl of shanties where grinding poverty prevails. With the incessant hype about India’s triumphant arrival on the global stage, it is perhaps easy to lose sight of the fact that India, according to latest UN statistics, is home to 410 million people living below the UN estimated poverty line of $1.25 a day, an increase of a 100 million from the year 2004. What this means in real terms is that no less than 410 million Indians (or about 37.2 per cent. of India's population) cannot afford two square meals a day that meet minimal nutritional needs.

According to a new 'multi-dimensional' poverty index developed by the United Nations Development Programme, acute poverty in eight Indian States (400 million, including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal) together account for more poor people than in the 26 poorest African nations combined (410 million, including war-ravaged Somalia and Sierra Leone). The new measure takes into account not only per capita income but also access to resources, education and medical care.

There was a view in the 1950s and 1960s, dominant amongst Western sceptics that India was too vast, too poor and too diverse to succeed as a nation. Born against a background of privation and civil war, divided along lines of caste, class, language and religion, independent India has defied numerous prophets of doom who believed that its poverty and heterogeneity would force it to break up or come under autocratic rule. Today, India can be justifiably proud of its vibrant democracy, its strongly secular tradition and its fiercely independent judiciary which has breathed life into the promises of the Constitution.

At the same time, in the face of daunting statistics on poverty, hunger, malnourishment, starvation deaths, illiteracy and lack of medical care, one cannot help but wonder: of what use is the lofty rhetoric on the right to life to a starving child in rural Chattisgarh or a homeless person on the streets of Delhi? Do India’s constitutional guarantees truly have meaning for those who suffer great deprivation of basic needs?

I must say, therefore, that while the discourse on human rights has usually focussed on civil and political rights, and their deprivation, such as violations of personal liberty without authority of law, rights of undertrial prisoners and so on, to my mind, the failure of the State, over the period of the last six decades, to eradicate the abject poverty which more than a third of the population of this country has to suffer, and to ensure that all its citizens are extended the minimum benefits of nutritious food and basic healthcare, is the single most important violation of human rights of our citizens. To repeat, one would ask oneself the question as to what purpose the rights such as freedom of speech, equality and access to justice would serve when a person has to suffer debilitating hunger and end his day without a meal, be unable to access the basic health services, and be compelled to sleep on pavements at the height of winter with only a sheet to cover himself - in other words, suffer what can only be termed as a mere animal existence.

It is not as if the three organs of the State have not made any effort to address the problems of poverty, hunger and disease, and the consequent denial of human rights. Each has been attempting to take steps to remedy the rather appalling situation that India finds itself in. For instance, The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 was enacted by Parliament to meet the national as well as international demand for the constitution of the National Human Rights Commission, State Human Rights Commissions in the States and Human Rights Courts for a holistic protection of human rights. In addition, innumerable laws have been enacted to implement some of the Directive Principles of State enshrined in Part IV of our Constitution and these laws strive and aim at protecting and promoting human rights. Some noteworthy instances are the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2006, which guarantees a minimum employment of 100 days each year to eligible adults, and the Right to Education Act, 2009, which guarantees the right to education to all children between the ages of 6 and 14. The task of implementing the policies incorporated in the various laws made by Parliament, and the State Legislatures, falls on the shoulders of the executive wing of the State.

However, it is really the judiciary in India, especially the higher judiciary, which really stands out as the institution which has exhibited the most concern, understanding, as well as positive action in the field of human rights. The Supreme Court of India has, through its various pronouncements, enhanced the coverage of the various rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It was Justice P.N. Bhagwati, who, in Francis’s Coralie’s case, declared that the “right to life is not a mere right to life under Article 21 and cannot be restricted to mere animal existence. It means much more than just physical survival and that further that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in adverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and mingling with fellow human beings…. there is implicit in Article 21 the right to protection against torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”

The Court has forged remedies and brought about dramatic and

far-reaching changes. For instance, in Hussainara Khatoon (III) v. State of Bihar, (1980) 1 SCC 108, the Court stated:

2…The Government in a social welfare State must set up rescue and welfare homes for the purpose of taking care of women and children who have nowhere else to go and who are otherwise uncared for by the society. It is the duty of government to protect women and children who are homeless or destitute… We direct that all women and children who are in the jails in the State of Bihar under ‘protective custody’ or who are in jail because their presence is required for giving evidence or who are victims of offence should be released and taken forthwith to welfare homes or rescue homes and should be kept there and properly looked after.

8…We, therefore, direct the Government of Bihar to inquire into these cases and where it is found that the investigation has been going on for a period of more than six months without satisfying the Magistrate that for special reasons and in the interest of justice the continuation of the investigation beyond the period of six months is necessary, the Government of Bihar will release the undertrial prisoners, unless the necessary orders of the Magistrate are obtained within a period of one month from today.

Shantistar Builders v. Narayan Khimalal Totame, (1990) 1 SCC 520



Basic needs of man have traditionally been accepted to be three — food, clothing and shelter. The right to life is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take within its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the right to decent environment and a reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference between the need of an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For the animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect — physical, mental and intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring fuller development of every child. That would be possible only if the child is in a proper home. It is not necessary that every citizen must be ensured of living in a well-built comfortable house but a reasonable home particularly for people in India can even be mud-built thatched house or a mud-built fire-proof accommodation.



Mohini Jain (Miss) v. State of Karnataka, (1992) 3 SCC 666



Right to life” is the compendious expression for all those rights which the courts must enforce because they are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life. It extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue. The right to education flows directly from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by the right to education. The State Government is under an obligation to make endeavour to provide educational facilities at all levels to its citizens. The “right to education”, therefore, is concomitant to the fundamental rights enshrined under Part III of the Constitution. The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of the citizens. The educational institutions must function to the best advantage of the citizens. Opportunity to acquire education cannot be confined to the richer section of the society.



People's Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, (1982) 3 SCC 235

6… But apart altogether from the requirement of Convention 59, we have Article 24 of the Constitution which provides that no child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. This is a constitutional prohibition which, even if not followed up by appropriate legislation, must operate proprio vigore and construction work being plainly and indubitably a hazardous employment, it is clear that by reason of this constitutional prohibition, no child below the age of 14 years can be allowed to be engaged in construction work . There can therefore be no doubt that notwithstanding the absence of specification of construction industry in the Schedule to the Employment of Children Act, 1938, no child below the age of 14 years can be employed in construction work and the Union of India as also every State Government must ensure that this constitutional mandate is not violated in any part of the country.

Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, (1984) 3 SCC 161



Moreover, when a complaint is made on behalf of workmen that they are held in bondage and are working and living in miserable conditions without any proper or adequate shelter over their heads, without any protection against sun and rain, without two square meals per day and with only dirty water from a nullah to drink, it is difficult to appreciate how such a complaint can be thrown out on the ground that it is not violative of the fundamental right of the workmen. It is the fundamental right of everyone in this country, assured under the interpretation given to Article 21 by this Court in Francis Mullin case1to live with human dignity, free from exploitation. This right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39 and Articles 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women, and of the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief. These are the minimum requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no State — neither the Central Government nor any State Government — has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials.



There is no area of human endeavour with regard to which the Supreme Court has not sought to bring its judicial activism to bear to bring relief to those whose human rights have been infringed.

A very significant step, undertaken by the Supreme Court, in my view, is the exercise to extend to the poverty stricken population the ‘right to food’. In April 2001, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL, Rajasthan) filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking legal enforcement of the right to food, a basic human rights issue.

The legal basis of the right to food has also been underscored by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). In the course of a hearing held on 17 January 2003, it has declared:

Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees a fundamental right to life and personal liberty. The expression ‘life’ in this Article has been judicially interpreted to mean a life with human dignity and not mere survival or animal existence. In the light of this, the State is obliged to provide for all those minimum requirements which must be satisfied in order to enable a person to live with human dignity, such as education, health care, just and humane conditions of work, protection against exploitation, etc. In the view of the Commission, the right to food is inherent to a life with dignity, and Article 21 should be read with Articles 39(a) and 47 to understand the nature of the obligation of the State in order to ensure the effective realization of this right(Article 39(a) of the Constitution enunciated as one of the Directive Principles, fundamental in the governance of the country, requires the State to direct its policy towards securing that citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood. Article 47 spells out the duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people as a primary responsibility).

The reading of Article 21 together with Articles 39(a) and 47 places the issue of food security in the correct perspective, thus making the right to food a guaranteed fundamental right which is enforceable by virtue of the constitutional remedy provided under Article 32 of the Constitution.

The NHRC went on to state that “there is a fundamental right to be free from hunger”. PUCL’s petition was filed at a time when the country’s food stocks reached unprecedentedly high levels while hunger in drought-affected areas intensified. Initially, the case was brought against the Government of India, the Food Corporation of India, and six state governments in the context of inadequate drought relief. Subsequently, the case was extended to the larger issues of chronic hunger and under-nutrition and all the state governments were added to the list of respondents.

Despite the interventions of an activist Supreme Court, almost every national social-security programme, theoretically serving as cradle-to-grave buffers against destitution, has been racked by failure. For instance, most tribals who are officially poor have no access to five major national schemes (subsidised food, child health care, mid-day meals, jobs for work and old-age pensions) on which India is slated to spend Rs 118,000 crores in 2010-11. This is illustrative of a deepening gulf between legal entitlements and ground realities.

A grim reminder of the depth of deprivation in the country recently emerged from a village, Ganne, in its most populous state, Uttar Pradesh (UP). The front page of a national newspaper recently reported that malnourished children in Ganne have been eating moist lumps of mud laced with silica - a raw material for glass sheets and soap - because they are not officially classified as poor and are therefore ineligible for subsidised food and other state programmes. The state governments came forward with a cruel and unbelievable defence - that the children were eating mud out of habit, and not hunger.

In Ganne, which is incidentally part of the former constituency of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, the effects of a faltering system are evident. 33% of the villagers are tribal, another 30% schedule castes, driven out of the jungle when forests were cleared for “development”. Many of the BPL cards in Ganne have been issued to rich or influential families. Two anganwadis (child health centres) serve the area. They are too distant for the villagers. It is a twelve-kilometre walk from the nearest road. With most land being unfit for cultivation, villagers have little choice but to work in the silica mines for exploitative contractors under conditions close to bonded labour.

They are not covered by any labour laws or medical benefits. Nine of ten mud-eating children are in the last stage of malnutrition. Eight of ten people are deprived of every national social-security net and starvation and hunger are their constant companions. The average life span of the people here is 40 years(Hunger stares you in the face, Samar Halarnkar, Hindustan Times, 28 May 2010).

A Supreme Court inquiry team that visited the area following the newspaper report had this to say:

A grim, catastrophic picture emerges from enquiry of commission (sic)…there is a total collapse of food-security related schemes,” said the report, recommending several “emergency measures” in up to 46 villages. “Protruding stomach, dry, whitish hair, ashen skin, skinny children — hunger stares you in the face.

The day after the Supreme Court’s enquiry team’s report was made public, the state government, as already pointed out, refuted this assessment, saying ""habit, not hunger"" made children eat mud. The report attributes the crisis to “apathy, insensitivity, nexus between vested interests and elected representatives with active approval of administration and state”. Written by Arundhati Dhuru, an advisor to the Supreme Court, and noted economist Jean Drèze, the report is the latest indicator of the frailty of India’s vast but inefficient and corruption-ridden social-security systems.

The Supreme Court, in some of its landmark pronouncements, has taken the view that the Government is under a constitutional obligation to provide healthcare facilities to For instance, in Vincent Panikurlangara v. Union of India, (1987) 2 SCC 165, the Court observed:

A healthy body is the very foundation for all human activities. That is why the adage “Sariramadyam Khaludharma Sadhanam”. In a welfare State, therefore, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health.

Again, in State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh Chawla, (1997) 2 SCC 83, the Court stated that:

It is now settled law that right to health is integral to the right to life. Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities.

The problem is, for all its talk of pro-poor policies, the Indian government’s overall expenditure on health until the fiscal year 2000-01 did not even amount to 1% of total GDP. Public expenditure on health for the current fiscal year (2009-10) is expected to be a measly 1.45%, according to figures published by the Government of India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

According to a study published by the World Health Organisation, aggregate government expenditure on health by all central government departments (health, defence, labour, etc.), state departments, local bodies and public enterprises amounts to 1.3% of India’s GDP for each of the years from 1999 to 2002. On the other hand, public spending on health in the year 2002 even by relatively poorer African governments, for instance, in Rwanda and Senegal exceeded India’s, amounting, respectively, to 3.1% and 2.3% of each country’s GDP.

Faced with the collapsing and/or woefully inadequate medical infrastructure in some of the poorest parts of India, one might well question the priorities of the leaders in Delhi and each of the state capitals. Surely the measure of the civilization of a nation lies, at least to some extent, in the way it cares for its sick and needy? There can be no greater irony than a country which loses no opportunity to advertise its world-class pharmaceutical and technological advancement to medical tourism but which does not have the wherewithal to care for its own most vulnerable citizens, thus grossly violating their human rights.

As the statistics quoted above will show, the goal of securing health for the poor is riddled with challenges at multiple levels: a lack of prioritization of the health sector vis-à-vis other sectors which receive (and have historically received) a greater share of public expenditure, a consequent paucity of resources, and finally, challenges stemming from faulty implementation, including leakages and other inefficiencies. These are ultimately largely policy questions within the domain of the legislature and the executive. At the same time, over the course of the last few years, orders of the Supreme Court in the “right to food” case have had some bearing on the right to health in the context of the government’s social security programmes.

Conclusion

India’s Constitution is celebrated the world over as an expression of progressive, liberal ideals symbolizing the hopes and aspirations of its founding fathers for a pluralistic society founded on values of democracy, secularism, equality and liberty. The Supreme Court has, in great measure, fulfilled its role as a vanguard of the Constitution, not only preserving and protecting the rights of individuals against arbitrary state action, but also asserting the rights of the vulnerable and weak in the face of glaring state inaction.

The Central Government cannot close its eyes to large-scale fraud in the public distribution system by taking the narrow constitutional position that implementation is each state’s responsibility. A shocking 58% of India’s subsidized food grain does not reach BPL families. After all, there are limits to what the court can achieve without decisive, collective action from every level of the administration if we are to make any

dent in the lives of the 410 million Indians who go to bed without a square meal a day. For so long as there are Indians who live in poverty and in want, the Constitution’s promise of rule of law is bereft of meaning, and human right of a vast population is reduced non-existent.

Long years ago, one of India’s greatest statesmen, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, remarked in his now legendary Tryst with Destiny speech, that the service of India means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. I will conclude with his words, to remind us, as he said, whither we will go and what shall be our endeavour:

There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be.

It is a great tragedy that his vision and hope for India remain unfulfilled even after six decades of the working of the Constitution.

It will lead tall ships parade - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-trb-tall-ships-rubber-duck-20140807-story.html,"When tall ships parade into L.A. Harbor in San Pedro this month, expect to see an enormous, inflatable Rubber Duck in the lead. The piece by artist Florentijn Hofman will visit the West Coast for the first time to kick off the Tallships Festival LA 2014.

The sculpture has been a cultural hit since it debuted as the world’s largest rubber duck in 2007. Hofman has created several of them in various sizes and they have sailed the world, visiting China, Hong Kong, New Zealand and even Pittsburgh, Pa.

Its creator says this duck comes in peace. “The Rubber Duck knows no frontiers, it doesn’t discriminate people and doesn’t have a political connotation,” Hofman says of his inflatable artwork.

Each location builds its own duck, a tall ships festival spokesman said via email. The one in San Pedro will be about six stories high. And let’s hope it’ll be smooth sailing.

Last month the Rubber Duck touring China was swept away by rains and floods, and another famously burst during a visit to Taiwan earlier this year.

L.A.'s duck will lead the Parade of Sail at 2 p.m. Aug. 20. After they arrive in L.A. Harbor, more than a dozen tall ships will be on display to visitors through Aug. 24. Tickets are available to go on daylong sails too. And there will be food, entertainment and performances along the waterfront during the five-day festival.

The battleships USS Iowa and the SS Lane Victory also will be open for tours as part of the festival. A five-day pass to step on board the ships costs $19 per person; day sail trips cost $85 per person.

195,Drought Sri Lanka,"Go organic to beat drought, says seed reviver - The Hindu",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/go-organic-to-beat-drought-says-seed-reviver/article19096142.ece,"Nel Jayaraman says some varieties of indigenous paddy are drought and salt water resistant

Organic farmer Nel Jayaraman has some advice for farmers struggling to grow high-yielding varieties of paddy during drought: Go organic. Having switched to growing indigenous paddy in an organic manner some 15 years ago, Mr. Jayaraman said farmers need spend only a little on input costs and can get good returns on their investment if they grew traditional varieties of paddy. Some of these rice varieties require less water compared to high-yielding varieties developed under the System of Rice Intensification (SRI).

“India is home to around 100,000 varieties of indigenous paddy, but the Green Revolution wiped out everything. I have managed to revive around 150 indigenous varieties, and these crops grow very well with no fertilisers and chemicals,” he said. Though the yield may be low compared to varieties such as IR-8, Mr. Jayaraman said organic farmers could earn more with less, unlike farmers now who produced higher yield but got less returns for their produce from the government.

“In a well-tilled field with good soil, I can grow 20 sacks (60 kg) of paddy in an acre of land. The market fetches around ₹30,000 in total at the rate of ₹1,500/sack. This is much higher compared to what farmers growing high-yielding varieties get from the government,” he said.

Low profit

High-yielding paddy fetches around 30-35 sacks/acre, which could be sold for ₹880-900 per sack, and the total expenses for cultivating per acre of paddy this way was around ₹30,000, farmers say. The margin of profit in SRI cultivation is low. There are native varieties that required only five bursts of rainfall to grow: during seed germination, during flowering, and so on, he said.

More than 3,000 organic farmers converged in Thiruthuraipoondi on Saturday to participate in an open seed festival, supported by CREATE, Mr. Jayaraman’s organisation, and NABARD as a major partner. Among those attending are horticulturist Usha Kumari and scientist S. Sulochana.

Usha Kumari, who represents Thanal, an organic farming organisation based in Thiruvananthapuram, said that a national-level ‘Save our Rice’ campaign that started in 2004 in Kumbalangi, Kerala, has begun to attract farmers from across the country who wish to switch to organic farming practices now. “After cotton, rice cultivation has the highest pesticide use ,” she said.

“In Tamil Nadu, varieties such as kattuyanam are both drought-proof and salt water tolerant. In places like Nagapattinam district where salt water intrusion has made farming difficult, farmers could grow these varieties.”

Health benefits

The Kattuyanam is a very tall variety of paddy, growing up to 8 feet tall. A red rice variety, it fetches more than Rs. 150/kg in the open market, Ms. Kumari said.

Besides good returns, the health benefits of organic rice is also a reason for its growing popularity.

Scientist S. Sulochana, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, said she had conducted studies that showed several indigenous paddy varieties had components that could cure cancer.

“Mappillai Samba, Kuzhiadichan, Kattu Ponni, Garudan Samba, Seeraga Samba and Poonggar are some of the indigenous paddy we studied. These traditional varieties contain squalene, compounds that are present in olive oil and cod liver oil, which can reduce bad cholesterol,” she said, sharing some of her research findings.",2017-06-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'varieties', 'growing', 'reviver', 'beat', 'grow', 'indigenous', 'water', 'drought', 'rice', 'seed', 'organic', 'jayaraman', 'paddy']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The District Administration is makingevery effort to address the drinking water problem prevailing in the entire district, said Collector K.S. Kandasamy, who addressed a meeting with farmers.

The district is being declared as drought-hit , and water supply augmentation works are going on at ₹32.81 crore, he said. Of this, ₹31.09 crore is being spent for village panchayats, ₹1.21 crore for municipal areas and ₹51 lakh is allocated for town panchayat areas.

In villages, the per capita water supply is being maintained to 40 litres and the villages where acute water shortage has been spelt out, officers have asked to provide water through water tankers, he said.

Private water purifying units are being monitored and anyone misusing drinking water would face action from the special officers appointed for this purpose. Residents facing water supply problems can contact control room numbers 04175-233303 or 04175-233141, said an official from the Collectorate.

It was estimated by officials that sugarcane crops grown on 400 hectares hadwithered due to shortage of water and plantain crops on 207 hectares were damaged. The district administration has sought ₹36 crore from the State exchequer to pay to the farmers, an official said.

Residents protest

About 100 residents took up the main Arcot Road in Vellore on Saturday evening to protest against the Vellore Muncipal Corporation officials for not maintaining regular water supply. The protesters claimed that the water supply through taps were stopped more than a week, which paralysed life for many residents. However, VCMC officials maintained that water supply was not effected for five days due to a burst in water main supplying water to that area.

The workers are attending to it seriously and meanwhile water supply has been arranged through lorries.

542,DR-2021-000054-SOM,"WFP: Millions in West, Central Africa Facing Hunger Emergency - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/africa/wfp-millions-west-central-africa-facing-hunger-emergency,"GENEVA - The United Nations World Food Program warns that millions of people in West and Central Africa are facing catastrophic levels of hunger driven by conflict and soaring food prices.

More than 31 million people, an increase of 10 million over last year, are expected to be unable to feed themselves during the upcoming June to August lean season. This period precedes the next harvest and is the time of year when food stocks in West Africa are at their lowest.

A U.N. food analysis found nearly 2.7 million people are a step away from famine. Among them, it says some 800,000 people are facing emergency levels of hunger in northeast Nigeria's conflict-ridden states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe.

FILE - A girl carries a baby on her back at the Kuchingoro internally displaced persons camp, in Abuja, Nigeria, June 20, 2020.

World Food Program spokesman Tomson Phiri says years of conflict have uprooted millions of people from their homes, destroying their livelihoods and making them dependent upon international aid. He says high food prices also are stoking the growing hunger emergency in the region.

""They have increased sharply across West Africa, leaving millions of people struggling to meet their basic food needs. The price of virtually all local staples has shot up. In some areas, prices are 200 percent higher — the highest levels since 2008,"" Phiri said.

WFP reports that escalating violence in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger is deepening food shortages for some 6.5 million people.

Phiri says malnutrition is worsening in the region. He notes a staggering 10 million children under age five are estimated to be acutely malnourished, a condition that is life-threatening and inhibits their physical and mental development.

""Almost half of those children in the Sahel countries are faced with high levels of global acute malnutrition, out of which 70 percent, approximately 3.3 million, will need emergency food and nutrition assistance immediately,"" he said.

WFP is scaling up its emergency food operation. It plans to help nearly 18 million people in 19 countries in West and Central Africa this year. The agency is appealing for $770 million to implement its humanitarian operation in the coming six months.

933,DR-2011-000121-CHN,"Out of a job, Gadhafi's Tuareg fighters may create new troubles - CNN International",https://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/08/libya.tuareg/,"(CNN) -- They are the Kurds of Africa, an ancient stateless people with their own language, a minority spread across several countries, weathered by their harsh surroundings.

And like the Kurds, the Tuareg are now at the center of international attention. Some are helping Moammar Gadhafi loyalists escape Libya across the endless expanses of the Sahel. Many more are trapped in Libya, trying to escape its post-revolutionary chaos.

Gadhafi often turned to the nomadic Tuareg to bolster his forces and his attempts to manipulate and destabilize the poor countries to the south of Libya: Niger, Chad and Mali. The Tuareg were capable mercenaries. And there was a hint of romance in the arrangement -- Gadhafi has always painted himself as a desert Bedouin.

Peter Gwin, a journalist with National Geographic, has visited Tuareg areas of Mali and Niger frequently. He says one Tuareg who had visited many Libyan army bases told him that even before the uprising against Gadhafi began there were some 10,000 Tuareg fighters in the Libyan military.

For the Tuareg it was a marriage of convenience; they could send money home and received arms and money for their rebellions. Gadhafi long supported the Niger Movement for Justice, a Tuareg rebel group, and gave its leaders villas in Tripoli.

As the revolt against his rule began, Gadhafi sent recruiters to Mali and Niger. Gwin says they were reportedly offering $1,000 a month to Tuareg recruits, an incredible sum in an area where the average income is less than $1 a day. Hundreds signed up.

One fighter Gwin met in the Malian city of Timbuktu described being involved in carrying out Gadhafi's order to ""clean"" the city of Misrata, a rebel stronghold.

""I asked him did that actually happen,"" said Gwin, ""and he said half of Misrata was cleaned. ... and I said what about civilians? And he said: 'Everyone.' What about women and children? And he nodded and said: 'Yes.' ""

But Tuareg fighters told Gwin that Gadhafi had failed to deliver on many promises -- of cash, homes and cars. And they were not expecting to be bombed from the air. Many deserted and began the long difficult journey home across the Sahara and arid mountain ranges, avoiding checkpoints as they went.

The danger now is that many of them -- young, jobless men -- will rekindle simmering revolts. In Niger the rebels control swathes of territory.

Gwin describes it in September's edition of National Geographic magazine as ""a vast primordial landscape -- a place defined by salt pans that take the better part of a day to cross, dune fields that rise and fall like violent seas, and mammoth outcroppings of glassy marble and obsidian that breach the sand like extinct sea creatures.""

The Tuareg trust few outsiders. Gwin says it is not only to combat the elements that the men cover their faces with turbans, and they are guided by a proverb: ""Kiss the hand you cannot sever.""

But since Mali and Niger gained independence, the Tuareg have been neglected and marginalized. In Niger, the Tuareg complain that they have no schools or wells -- even as governments have raked in millions from rich seams of uranium.

That was the spark for the most recent revolt. Not all Tuaregs supported it; there are disparate factions and clans. Even so, the governments of the Sahel -- especially Niger -- are shuddering at the prospect of well-armed fighters returning to their unstable countries.

A group of prominent Tuaregs from Niger and Mali has appealed to Libya's National Transitional Council to protect those Tuaregs still in Libya. Mohamed Anacko, head of the Agadez Regional Council in Niger, told CNN that they ""wanted to avoid a crisis like in Libya here at home. So (we wanted) to make a contract between those who fight, who are in the Libyan army and the NTC.""

Niger and Mali are very fragile states, Anacko said by phone from Agadez. ""There really is a risk of famine this year. There are lots of people who are arriving, some are transferring to West Africa but (others) are remaining in Agadez some months. ... so we have lots of worries this year, in the next three to four months.""

Human rights groups have also called on Libya's new rulers not to seek revenge against the Tuareg and other Africans, to prevent a further flood of refugees. Niger -- in the grip of a prolonged drought -- is already struggling to absorb as many as 200,000 of its own citizens who have returned from Libya, according to the European Union's counter-terrorism co-coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove.

There is also the risk that renewed instability in the region will play into the hands of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), one of the group's fastest-growing affiliates, which has made a lot of money from kidnap ransoms.

Terrorism analysts say AQIM may already have obtained weapons looted in Libya's chaos. Nigerien forces were involved in a shoot-out in June against an armed group carrying detonators, explosives and cash. The government said they were destined for AQIM.

Anacko told CNN that his group was trying to help Libyans and others who were trying to escape the fighting, to prevent al Qaeda from taking advantage of the situation. ""If we don't help them, it is certain that al Qaeda will take them,"" he said. ""We open the door, weapons or not, they give away their weapons and they go back.""

The Tuareg are not Arabs and have little sympathy for al Qaeda, but their paths may cross in the flourishing drugs trade in this part of Africa. The Tuareg have a reputation for doing business with anyone.

In his National Geographic piece, Peter Gwin relates a conversation with a Tuareg rebel commander who said the West should help them combat al Qaeda and drug smugglers. ""Given the Tuareg history of betrayal and infighting,"" Gwin asked him, ""could the West trust them?""

""He answered with a click of his tongue. I couldn't gauge his expression because his face was completely obscured by his turban.""",2011-09-08 07:00:00+00:00,"['tuareg', 'gwin', 'gadhafi', 'al', 'niger', 'told', 'gadhafis', 'qaeda', 'create', 'national', 'libya', 'mali', 'troubles', 'job', 'fighters']",China,news article,English

Sai Masu Gida are hoping for maximum concentration in the neighbouring state ahead of their continental qualifier

Ahead of their crucial Caf Champions League tie away to Ghana's Asante Kotoko in Kumasi next weekend, the management of Kano Pillars have announced the club will be returning to Kaduna to prepare for the game.

According to a statement on the Pillars official website, coach Ibrahim Musa’s men will leave Kano for Kaduna on Sunday to proceed into close camping for the game against the Porcupines.

“Players and technical crew, as well as some supporting staff of the team, would leave kano after the club's morning training session on Sunday 18th August 2019,” the statement credited to the club chairman Surajo Yahaya read in part.

“The club would spend three to four days in Kaduna before they move to Abuja where they would fly through Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport to Accra, the capital city of Ghana and then to Kumasi where the second leg would be played.”

Pillars hold a slim 3-2 advantage going into the second leg but the club chairman has advised the team to put the previous result behind them and go all out to get the job done in Kumasi.

“Forget about the 3-2 victory in the first leg and tight your belts to make Kano and Nigeria proud, the club boss added.

During the camping exercise in Kaduna, some warm-up matches have been lined up for Pillars to put then in good shape for the second leg.

The Nigerian side need at least a draw or a win to guarantee them a place in the next stage, where they would either face Hafia FC of Guinea or Tunisian club Etoile du Sahel.",2019-08-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['pillars', 'kotoko', 'leg', 'kaduna', 'return', 'second', 'tie', 'caf', 'club', 'team', 'champions', 'league', 'prepare', 'kano', 'leave', 'statement']",Ghana,news article,English
775,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Day Zero for water: Mexico on the list of water-stressed countries - Mexico News Daily,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/day-zero-for-water/,"About a third of the world’s population of over 7 billion live in countries at high risk of running out of water in the near future, and Mexico ranks high on the list, according to a study by the World Resources Institute.

The institute categorized countries into five different levels according to their relative risk of consuming all of their water resources, ranging from “Low Baseline Water Stress” to “Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.”

Mexico falls into the high-stress category, the second-highest on the list, meaning that the nation consumes between 40% and 80% of the water supply available in a year. Overall, Mexico ranks 24th out of the 164 nations included in the study.

However, a more detailed look at the maps included in the study shows that some regions of Mexico are under significantly more baseline water stress than others. Fifteen states, all in northern and central Mexico, fall within the “Extremely High Baseline Water Stress” category, meaning that they consume between 80% and 100% of available water every year.

Among the states most vulnerable to water crises Baja California Sur is in the lead, followed closely by Guanajuato, Mexico City, Aguascalientes, México state, Querétaro, Hidalgo, Chihuahua, Zacatecas, Sonora, Sinaloa, Nuevo León, Morelos, Jalisco and Tamaulipas.

Several Mexican states, mostly located in the Gulf region, are at medium to high risk of suffering drought, including Tabasco, Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Tlaxcala, Yucatán, Colima and Puebla.

Mexico is one of 44 countries, representing one-third of the world’s population, deemed most at risk of hitting “Day Zero,” the point at which there is not enough water to meet the needs of its citizens.

“Water stress poses serious threats to human lives, livelihoods and business stability. It’s poised to worsen unless countries act: population growth, socioeconomic development and urbanization are increasing water demands, while climate change can make precipitation and demand more variable.”

However, the institute stressed that decisive action could have a significant and swift impact on countries’ available water resources.

It said that to step back from impending disaster, countries should implement several strategies, including increasing agricultural efficiency, investing in gray and green infrastructure and treating, reusing and recycling water.

“The data is clear: there are undeniably worrying trends in water. But by taking action now and investing in better management, we can solve water issues for the good of people, economies and the planet.”

It also has a real impact on the health of populations. In Tunisia, for example, 23 beaches were closed in 2020 because their water was unsuitable for swimming. Most of the rubbish in the oceans is dumped by ships.

The GloLitter Partnerships (GLP) programme, launched by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), aims to support partner countries in their plastic waste management policies. This is the case for Togo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Gambia, Kenya, Madagascar, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Sudan, Tanzania, etc.

A project supported by Norway

In the first phase of the GLP, the IMO, the implementing agency, will review the availability and adequacy of port reception facilities. The organisation will raise awareness among stakeholders in the shipping and fishing sectors and encourage the marking of fishing gear so that it can be traced back to its owner in the event of discards or loss at sea. “Partner countries will also receive tools, such as guidance documents, training materials and strategies, to help them implement existing regulations and communicate with each other, as well as to support them in developing port waste management plans,” says Jose Matheickal, head of the IMO’s Partnerships and Projects Department. The GLP programme is funded by the Norwegian Development Agency (Norad) and is expected to end in 2023.

As part of the GLP, the IMO will also raise awareness of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol) among officials in partner countries. The text provides for a ban on the discharge of plastics (including fishing gear) from ships at sea. In addition, the Protocol to the London Convention, which regulates the dumping of waste from ships and only allows certain types of non-harmful waste, will also need to be respected by partner countries to break the vicious circle of plastic waste pollution in their oceans.

In addition, the GloLitter Partnerships programme will promote the development of a circular economy in the plastic value chain in Africa, notably through recycling.

Berenike, also known as Berenice Troglodytica was founded in the 3rd century BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, upon a narrow rim of shore at the head of the Sinus Immunduson on the west coast of the Red Sea.

The city was named after his mother Berenice I, and served as a trading centre with the East Coast of Africa, India, and Arabia for the transportation of war Elephants and exotic goods.

The first stage of the Hellenistic period was interrupted by a period of abandonment for almost half a century around 200 BC, until the city was reoccupied in the latter part of the second century BC.

Archaeologists conducting studies of an ancient well used by the city garrison in a fortified gate complex, suggest that the city was abandoned due to climatic changes brought on by a volcanic eruption.

Previous research found that a volcanic eruption in 209 BC from an unidentified volcano ejected a significant amount of gas and ash into the atmosphere, shifting North-Eastern Africa’s climate and causing a weakening of the annual Nile flood.

The failure of the Nile flood drove the Egyptian people to rise up against the Hellenistic rulers of Egypt in a period known as the ‘Great Theban Revolt’ of 207–186 BC.

This climatic event most likely disrupted the fragile climate of the Red Sea region driving the drought at Berenike, causing the well to dry up and be buried with windblown sand.

Archaeologists methodically removed the thick layers of sand filling the well, where they found coins, amphora, and other datable material that suggest the event happened at the very end of the third century BC.

The drought closed the desert route to Berenike and disrupted the long-distance sea routes that the city was dependent upon, resulting in the eventual abandonment. Find out more

Netizens lash out at actress' apparent apathy - International Business Times, India",https://www.ibtimes.co.in/priyanka-chopra-are-you-even-aware-assam-floods-netizens-lash-out-actress-apparent-apathy-801766,"Priyanka Chopra is facing a lot of heat on social media for not saying anything about the ongoing floods in Assam.

Assam is facing a serious crisis as floods in the state have already claimed at least 15 lives and affected around 43 lakh. Scores of cattle and animals at Kaziranga National Park have also been killed in the disaster.

However, Priyanka, who is the brand ambassador of Assam tourism, has not made any tweet or comment on the ongoing havoc. Priyanka has been making several posts on social media, the latest being on promoting a beauty campaign, but she has not made any tweet expressing concern for the people in Assam or urging people to raise relief fund.

This apparent indifferent attitude of the popular actress has been raising eyebrows. Scores of people have been expressing disappointment at Priyanka being absolutely silent on Assam floods.

A lot of them have also been tweeting to Priyanka, requesting her to talk about it and urge people to help the state. Many others are highly miffed at PeeCee's apparent apathy towards the current condition of Assam and its people.

""You are the brand Ambassador for 'Awesome Assam ' Do u have any idea what is happening in Assam now? 90% of #Kaziranga is under water. Over 30 lacs people affacted by #FloodinAssam .

""Dear Priyanka Chopra In case you have forgotten, you are also the Brand Ambassador of Assam Tourism. A state submerged in flood right now. Where is your concern, your tweet creating awareness and asking people to extend help for them? Shame on you,"" wrote another.

Numerous such angry tweets are being made tagging Priyanka, but no response came from the actress as of now.

Despite these events, deadlier or costlier disasters in Asia and North America often overshadow disasters in Africa. However, with a rapidly growing population and increasing impact of climate change, the disaster impact in Africa will likely increase in the coming decades. Therefore, CRED Crunch 56 will focus on disasters across the African continent in the past 20 years.

With over 50 countries across approximately 30 million square kilometers of land, the threat of natural hazards in Africa varies greatly by geography and season. Figure 1 demonstrates the type of disaster that affects the highest number of people in each African country. Regions of southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel have been most affected by drought, while much of central Africa and western Africa has been most affected by floods. Countries in south-eastern Africa (some of which are not featured on the map) face an annual cyclone season leaving them most affected by storms.

Although disasters occur across the entire continent, some countries are more affected than others. Since 2000, Kenya (60 events), Mozambique (55 events), and South Africa (54 events) experienced the highest number of disasters as they regularly face storms, droughts, and flooding. The 3 most populated subSaharan countries, Nigeria (49 events), Ethiopia (43 events), and D.R. Congo (41 events), also fall into the top 10. In terms of death tolls, as seen in Figure 2, Somalia ranks first primarily as a result of the 2010 drought, while Algeria ranks second with most deaths occurring from a single earthquake.

As seen in Figure 3, floods and droughts were the most prevalent and impactful type of disasters on the continent. From 2000-2019, floods were responsible for 64% of disaster events, followed by storms at 15%. Unlike other continents, such as Asia, earthquakes and volcanoes are not prominent types of disasters. As well, due to relatively poor health surveillance, the impacts of extreme temperatures are considered to be under reported.

So far in this century, droughts have been the deadliest disaster type, followed by floods. In fact, most of the drought deaths can be attributed to a single event, namely the one in Somalia in 2010 when approximately 20,000 people died. This drought, along with the Somali Civil War, lead to a famine declaration due to high mortality and malnutrition.

In terms of people affected, droughts make up by far the largest share of disasters in Africa. This figure may be attributed to various climatic and geographic features, as well as the reliance on rain-fed agriculture by large portion of the population in low resource rural areas. The most impactful drought events so far this century by number of people affected were the 2003 and 2004 South African drought (15 million & 12.6 million people affected respectively), 2015 Ethiopian drought (10.2 million people affected), and 2009 Niger drought (7.9 million people affected).

In recent years the share of global events, deaths, and people affected occurring in Africa has risen; as seen in figure 4.

This trend will likely continue as Africa’s share of the global population rises from approximately 13% in the year 2000 to 26% by 2050 (1). In absolute terms, the population of Africa is projected to increase from the current 1.3 billion inhabitants to 2.5 billion by 2050, thus nearly doubling the potential population affected by disasters (1). Additionally, rapid growth in population increases the likelihood of urbanization in areas exposed to natural hazards and resource shortages. In addition to population growth, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2) has stated that Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced more frequent and intense climate extremes in previous decades as a result of climate change, a trend that is likely to continue as the impacts of climate change intensifies. Regions across the continent are expected to face increased extreme temperatures, droughts, and increases in heavy rainfall (2).",2019-11-18 08:00:00+00:00,"['world', 'africa', 'droughts', 'issue', 'affected', 'cred', 'events', 'drought', 'population', '2019', 'figure', 'crunch', 'continent', 'review', 'million', 'newsletter', '56', 'disasters']",Mozambique,news article,English
436,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghanistan Humanitarian Needs Overview 2020 (December 2019) - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-needs-overview-2020-december-2019,"Summary of Humanitarian Needs

Context & humanitarian impact of the crisis

Afghanistan is now the scene of the deadliest conflict on earth. Fighting continues to rage, exposing civilians, particularly women and children, to daily deadly risks, prompting mass displacement and choking the country’s unstable economy. Years of shocks have left an acutely vulnerable population with few economic resources, an eroded capacity to cope with the unfolding crisis and little hope of recovery if the current conditions persist.

Scope of the analysis

The Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) is based around a common projected scenario for 2020 which expects the status quo to continue or conditions to slightly worsen over the year ahead. This scenario would see a continuation of the highest levels of violence, protection risks for civilians and ongoing violations of international humanitarian law. In view of the bleak outlook, the Humanitarian Country Team conducted a mid-term review of multi-year planning parameters. It concluded that the scope of humanitarian analysis and action during the past two years in Afghanistan was too restrictive and not aligned with the current trajectory of needs, which have reverted to past levels. It was agreed that due to the continued high tempo of the conflict and the setbacks created by the drought, the current multi-year projections and framework for action required a course adjustment in 2020 and 2021, broadening of the scope of humanitarian action and resulting in a significant increase in people in need.

Humanitarian consequences

The humanitarian consequences of the crisis now affect every aspect of life in all corners of the country. People’s survival and well-being is threatened by ongoing conflict, inflicting high levels of civilian casualties and life-altering traumatic injuries. Afghanistan is the world’s deadliest conflict for children. Around four million people are estimated to live with physical disability.2 Constant exposure to high-stress, conflict situations and repeated loss of friends and family members are taking their toll on the mental health of people living in Afghanistan. Hunger and malnutrition remain at dangerously high levels despite the passing of the drought with 14.28 million people forecast to be in crisis or emergency food insecurity in the first months of 2020. People’s living conditions have been eroded by years of war and disaster. Inability to access services is a key consequence of the crisis and is a product of a range of factors including conflict, insecurity and fear, poverty and under-investment. Across the country, 3.7 million children are out of school and millions of displaced families lack permanent shelters and appropriate sanitation. About one third of the population (mostly those living in hard-to-reach areas) does not have access to a functional health centre within two hours of their home. The country is facing a protection crisis where people’s rights to safety, security and well-being under international law are regularly threatened. Conflict and displacement have resulted in internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable people resorting to severe negative coping mechanisms such as early/forced marriages, child labour and begging. Women and girls are deprived of basic rights, particularly education, and gender based violence is pervasive. Afghanistan is littered with landmines and other explosive hazards (new and old), exposing civilians to daily risks. Insecure housing, land and property rights are a key source of vulnerability for many Afghans, particularly IDPs, returnees and women. The cumulative impacts of decades of war, combined with repeated displacement, grinding poverty, a lack of jobs and crippling debt have eroded people’s resilience and capacity to cope with recurrent shocks. A large proportion of the population now lacks the emotional strength or resources to support their own recovery, perpetuating a cycle of aid dependency.

People in need

As a result of the new scope of analysis and the cumulative impact of conflict and disaster, almost a quarter of the country’s population (9.4 million people out of a population of almost 38 million) is now estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2020. The majority of those in need are children (56 per cent). Upward adjustments in needs have been made across every sector with Protection needs showing the largest change (2.4 million in 2019, 7 million in 2020). Looking forward to 2021, the final year of the current multi-year HRP, clusters have projected a similar figure for people in need, based on a continuation of the current security scenario. Overall the PiN figure will decrease slightly to 9 million in 2021.

Severity of needs

The crisis in Afghanistan is now affecting every province in the country with shock-affected households facing multiple humanitarian needs simultaneously, undermining their capacity to cope and recover. In the Whole of Afghanistan (WOA) Assessment, 62 per cent of shock-affected households nationally were found to have concurrent sectoral needs in two or more sectors. Inter-sectoral needs were prevalent across all geographical areas suggesting a necessity for a stronger focus on integrated response across the country. Overlapping sectoral needs were highest among shock-affected households in Uruzgan in the south and Takhar in the north-east. Both provinces have been heavily affected by conflict and displacement, overloading existing basic services and stretching the capacity of aid agencies for a comprehensive response. Shock-affected households in rural areas are significantly more likely to face at least two simultaneous sectoral needs (71 per cent) compared to households living in urban areas (55 per cent).",2019-12-17 08:00:00+00:00,"['households', '2019', 'crisis', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'current', '2020', 'conflict', 'population', 'humanitarian', 'country', 'overview', 'needs']",Afghanistan,news article,English

Right on schedule, it looks like the annual monsoon across the Southwest is getting ready to kick back into gear.

A return of monsoonal moisture is likely across the Southwest later this week, potentially bringing drought relief to a part of the country that has been hit hard by drought and wildfires in recent months.

The monsoon is in reference to the annual reversal of winds, and the southerly wind direction frequently draws up moisture-laden air from the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean. The result is needed rainfall for a typically parched part of the country.

It typically starts in mid-summer, and that looks to be the case this week.

While showers and storms aren’t expected to be particularly widespread, both Wednesday and Thursday could both feature scattered showers and storms, and they’ll be mainly concentrated in New Mexico.

Of course, this is a part of the country that especially needs the rain. After a paltry monsoon season last summer and early fall, a fruitful monsoon would be especially welcomed this year.

Pockets of extreme and severe drought are in place in some of the most monsoon-dependent areas, including northern New Mexico and southern Colorado.

While it’ll be hot in Albuquerque, New Mexico most of this week, daily shower and storm chances will creep back into the picture this weekend, and that could last into next week as well.

KABUL, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Harsh poverty and rising unemployment have spread across Afghanistan as the prolonged conflicts and fighting in the country, as well as drought and a decline in agribusiness, added to the miseries of the war-weary Afghans.

More than 2,790 civilians were killed and over 5,250 others injured in conflict-related incidents in the first nine months of the year in the war-torn country, according to figures released by the United Nations mission in the country.

Almost 54 percent of the country's population of more than 30 million currently live below the poverty line, according to the latest information provided by the Central Statistic Organization of Afghanistan earlier this year.

Afghan Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) Nasir Ahmad Durrani said recently that the government plans to provide support for the most needy families, but said the government alone could not fully tackle the nation's poverty problem.

Durrani said the ministry was working on six specific issues to help with food security in the land-locked country.

""For the eradication of famine, lasting food safety and reaching Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SGD2) targets, the MAIL plans involves direct links to food safety resources, such as animal husbandry or in the area of increasing the yields of wheat, rice and other agricultural harvests.""

""This, as well as raising the standard of fruit and vegetable products,"" added the minister.

According to Durrani, the growth of agricultural products, supporting farmers, raising the agricultural and husbandry product quality, rising the value of agriculture and livestock chain products, and reviewing current agricultural policy in light of climate change, are among the factors and work that has been done by the ministry.

The ministry has distributed up to 119 tons of wheat among the needy and vulnerable people in 25 of the country's 34 provinces, he said.

Some 60 tons of wheat has also been made available to the World Food Program (WFP) to be changed into flour, by adding some needed ingredients in cooperation with the local and international aid agencies to be distributed among 1.4 million needy people, said Durrani.

The latest food distribution plans come as up to 20 of the country's 34 provinces have been affected by the drought, and Afghan officials have predicted that around 3 million people will be in need of aid until the end of this year.

In another effort to help the needy people, the United Nations has allocated 34.6 million U.S. dollars to support drought-affected Afghans, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.

The fund will help seven national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 15 international NGOs and four UN agencies ""to distribute food and seeds, maintain primary health services, provide emergency shelters, safe drinking water, improve hygiene and sanitation, treat severe malnutrition, and help farmers protect their livestock,"" the OCHA said.

The Afghan unemployment rate has risen 2 percent to 27 percent in the last Afghan year, which ended on March 20 this year, with the number of jobless people keeping growing while private investment continues to decline.

Afghans hope that the just-concluded parliamentary election and the following presidential election which is slated for early next year will bring positive changes to the living conditions of poor people.",2018-10-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['prolonged', 'food', 'nations', 'help', 'rising', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'products', 'wheat', 'united', 'needy', 'poverty', 'agricultural', 'amid', 'conflicts', 'xinhua']",Afghanistan,news article,English
651,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The Unbearable Cost of Drought in Africa - Inter Press Service,http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/04/the-unbearable-cost-of-drought-in-africa/,"The Unbearable Cost of Drought in Africa

ROME, Apr 12 2017 (IPS) - Nearly 50 per cent of all emergency multilateral food assistance to Africa is due to natural disasters, with advancing droughts significantly threatening both livelihoods and economic growth, warns the African Union through its ground-breaking extreme weather insurance mechanism designed to help the continent’s countries resist and recover from the ravages of drought.



The mechanism, known as the African Risk Capacity (ARC) provides participating African states with quick-disbursing funds in the event of drought, and assists countries in developing drought response contingency plans to implement timely and effective responses.

“The result is significant economic and welfare benefits for participating countries and vulnerable households.”

As currently structured, ARC reports, the cost of responding to extreme weather events in Africa, particularly droughts, is borne largely by the international community.

To give an order of magnitude using World Food Programme (WFP) operations as a proxy for international aid flows, in 2012 WFP assisted 54.2 million people in Africa, spending US $2.7 billion –66 per cent of WFP’s global expenditure that year, it adds.

Droughts significantly threaten record Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in sub-Saharan Africa, ARC warned, while explaining that 1-in-10 year drought event could have an estimated adverse impact of 4 per cent on the annual GDP of Malawi for example, with even larger impacts for 1-in-15 and 1-in-25 year events.

“Such decreased productivity detracts from economic growth, causes major budget dislocation, erodes development gains and resilience, and requires additional emergency aid from the international community in the future.” One dollar spent on early intervention through ARC saves 4.40 dollars spent after a crisis unfolds.

Devastating Effects for Households

The African Union’s extreme weather insurance mechanism also informs that at the household level, the consequences of drought can be devastating in countries with low resilience where large sectors of population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihood.

Experts from Oxford University and International Food Policy Research Institute conducted a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to examine household coping actions when faced with a drought, and the likely long-term cost impacts of these actions, according to ARC.

The study estimated the economic benefits of early intervention and thus protecting a household’s economic growth potential –that is, intervening in time to prevent households’ negative coping actions such as reduced food consumption, livestock death, and distressed productive asset sales, which, in the absence of external assistance, have increasingly pronounced negative consequences.

“The CBA calculated that the economic benefit of aid reaching households within the critical three months after harvest could result in nearly 1,300 dollars per household assisted in terms of protected economic gains.”

A further analysis shows the potential benefit of ARC outweighs the 4.4 times compared to traditional emergency appeals for assistance, as a result of reduced response times and risk pooling.

Lake Chad Basin – Extreme Emergency

The ARC report about the impact of droughts in Africa came out shortly before the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) chief’s visit to some of the affected areas in North-Eastern Nigeria, where conflict has forced an estimated 2.5 million people to leave their homes and livelihoods.

The Sub-Saharan Lake Chad Basin, which is the main source of water in the region, between 1963 and 2013 lost 90 per cent of its water mass, with massive impact on the population, according to FAO.

Across the region, (encompassing parts of Nigeria, Cameroun, Chad and Niger), which is currently faced with one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world, some 7 million people risk severe hunger during the lean season and require immediate food and livelihood assistance.

“There are fifty thousand people on the brink of famine in the region, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is famine, they are already at level 4”, FAO director general Graziano da Silva warned.

Following three years of drought, agriculture including livestock and fisheries can no longer be left unattended, he said.

Agriculture produces food and sustains 90 per cent of the local population. Many of the people in the area have already sold their possessions including seeds and tools and their animals have been killed by the armed groups.

“Pastoralists and fishers need to be supported as well for animal restocking. Otherwise if internally displaced persons don’t have their animals and their jobs back, they will remain in the refugee camps, “ the FAO DG emphasised.

Contribution to Long-term Resilience and Growth in Africa Low resilience households must grow by more than 3 per cent annually in real terms to withstand a 1-in-5 year drought.

For many countries in Africa, a small shock in terms of a rainfall deficit or elevated food prices can precipitate a call for a major humanitarian intervention and emergency response. The resilience in such countries is significantly low such that they struggle through most years, let alone during a drought.

For example, in a country such as Niger, where households currently display very low resilience, the ARC team has calculated that to event, the income of the most vulnerable households would have to grow by an annual average of 3.4 per cent over the next five years in real terms to build sufficient resilience in order to adequately cope without requiring external assistance.

In the meantime, insurance is not the ‘correct’ tool to deal with this chronic risk. In order to improve such countries’ resilience to natural disasters, thereby enabling sustained growth on the continent, two key elements are required: risk management and investment.

Drought, a complex and slowly encroaching natural hazard with significant and pervasive socio-economic and environmental impacts, is known to cause more deaths and displace more people than any other natural disaster, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).

By 2050, the demand for water is expected to increase by 50 per cent, it reports, adding that as populations increase, especially in dryland areas, more and more people are becoming dependent on fresh water supplies in land that are becoming degraded.

“Water scarcity is one of the greatest challenges of the twenty-first century. The Global Risks report published by World Economic Forum ranks ‘water crisis’ as the top risk in the coming decade and it has a place in the Sustainable Development Goals where a specific goal has been dedicated to water.”

Drought and water scarcity are considered to be the most far-reaching of all natural disasters, causing short and long-term economic and ecological losses as well as significant secondary and tertiary impacts, UNCCD informs.

The African Risk Capacity was established as a Specialized Agency of the African Union to help Member States improve their capacities to better plan, prepare and respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters, therefore protecting the food security of their vulnerable populations.",2017-04-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'water', 'drought', 'countries', 'food', 'arc', 'cost', 'cent', 'unbearable', 'resilience', 'economic', 'risk']",Ghana,news article,English
54,DR-2014-000109-CHN,KCON a mini-Coachella for Korean pop music - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-kcon-20140808-story.html,"Despite the growing popularity of South Korean pop music in the U.S., the genre has always faced one particular challenge. Very few American fans can see K-pop acts perform live.

Some popular South Korean bands like Girls’ Generation or 2NE1 have played showcases in major U.S. cities, and the girl group Crayon Pop just toured with Lady Gaga. Yet for most such acts, it’s never made logistical or financial sense to play the States, despite a fervent fan subculture here.

This year’s KCON, the third installment of the annual K-pop festival in downtown L.A., might be changing that line of thinking.

Four rising and established South Korean pop acts — Bangtan Boys, IU, Jung Joon Young and SPICA — are making their American live debuts this year. KCON isn’t just a sprawling fan convention anymore — it’s becoming a hub for Korean acts to make their first steps into the U.S. touring market.

“A lot of [K-pop] acts have met with the top U.S. booking agents, but they couldn’t afford the cost of giving up tour dates in Asia,” said Angela Killoren, co-project manager of KCON. “But festivals like KCON are a great way for them to meet fans and perform without committing to the infrastructure of a full tour.”

Last year, the event moved from Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena downtown and dramatically expanded its scope. An estimated 20,000 fans attended two days’ worth of concerts, workshops, panel discussions and Korean pop-culture exhibitions. The festival has become a kind of K-pop Coachella or South by Southwest.

“The reputation for the stateside KCON festival back in Korea is big news,” SPICA’s members said in a jointly answered email interview. “Many K-pop artists and companies see this as an important portal into the American marketplace, as the festival has been growing every year.”

Last year’s headlining concert, featuring the likes of G-Dragon, and Teen Top, capped the weekend (with American MC Missy Elliott hopping onstage with G-Dragon). The sets finally scratched the live itch of many U.S. fans.

“Our fans know way more about this music than even we do, but we always try to bring new artists to them,” Killoren said. “Last year, Dynamic Duo and 2AM weren’t as well known over here, but fans went crazy for them.”

Since last year, the genre’s crossover has ramped up in America. 2NE1 released “Crush,” a dark and modern dance-pop album that debuted at No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart in March and, at 5,000 copies sold, earned the biggest first-week sales for a K-pop album in the U.S. G-Dragon appeared on EDM producer Skrillex’s debut major-label LP and collaborated with well-known U.S. producers like Diplo and Baauer on his album “Coup d’Etat.”

In K-pop culture, each of these groups is an established act in America. But now that K-pop (or hallyu, as it’s known) culture has grown past the novelty factor here, there’s a question of how to introduce new generations of artists in America.

Internet exposure is no problem. Videos like Girls’ Generation’s “I Got a Boy” can rack up a hundred million YouTube views, and there’s a rich ecosystem of hallyu-centric online media to document its stars’ comings and goings.

Yet for U.S. audiences outside New York and L.A., digital fandom might not be enough.

“So much fan interaction in K-pop is virtual. Fans are crazy about it, but they never get a chance to touch it,” Killoren said. Without in-person ways to connect, American fans could lose enthusiasm.

KCON’s increasing focus on U.S. debut performances gives fans something more to see, and crowds are willing to travel for that experience. Killoren estimates that 40% of ticket sales this year have been to fans outside California — from Texas and New York but also from Mexico and Sweden.

For South Korean stars without a big American audience, the fest isn’t just a way to make a splashy U.S. debut. It can bolster their reputations back home too.

“It’s big news back in Asia when K-pop artists play in the States,” SPICA said. “It helps their reputation back home. I think K-pop artists are very careful and selective about what they do in the States. They want to develop fan bases over time and build the confidence to play live here.”

SPICA will perform its first English-language single, “I Did It,” at the fest as part of a rollout to capture more such markets.

Outside of Psy, the viral sensation behind “Gangnam Style,” K-pop hasn’t yet made a big dent in U.S. top 40, but it’s not necessarily KCON’s job to crack that ceiling. It’s to keep the K-pop faithful and newly curious fans feeling like they have a stake in the music.

As Killoren put it, “This is a way to recharge your K-pop fandom.”

820,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Oceanic and radiative forcing of medieval megadroughts in the American Southwest - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaax0087,"Multidecadal “megadroughts” were a notable feature of the climate of the American Southwest over the Common era, yet we still lack a comprehensive theory for what caused these megadroughts and why they curiously only occurred before about 1600 CE. Here, we use the Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product, in conjunction with radiative forcing estimates, to demonstrate that megadroughts in the American Southwest were driven by unusually frequent and cold central tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) excursions in conjunction with anomalously warm Atlantic SSTs and a locally positive radiative forcing. This assessment of past megadroughts provides the first comprehensive theory for the causes of megadroughts and their clustering particularly during the Medieval era. This work also provides the first paleoclimatic support for the prediction that the risk of American Southwest megadroughts will markedly increase with global warming.

The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system and its modulation of storm track variability have been the primary driver of seasonal droughts in much of North America over the Instrumental era ( 6 ). Therefore, the most prominent Southwest megadrought hypotheses invoke ENSO as the probable cause but in different fashions: Either ENSO was radiatively forced into a persistent La Niña–like mean state [through the dynamical thermostat mechanism ( 7 – 9 )] or internal climate variability simply produced multidecadal periods of increased La Niña events ( 10 – 15 ). Recent work nevertheless provides little evidence for a persistent La Niña–like mean state during the Medieval period ( 16 – 21 ), and although stochastic ENSO variability can explain isolated megadroughts, their clustering before 1600 CE is extremely difficult to explain with the ENSO variability that is characteristic of the Instrumental era ( 13 , 19 , 22 ). Additionally, a warm North Atlantic may suppress summer precipitation in the Great Plains and the Southwest [e.g., ( 23 – 26 )], but the support for this mechanism causing or increasing the likelihood of megadroughts is relatively tentative ( 19 ).

Megadroughts ( 1 , 2 ) are multidecadal periods of intense aridity that existed over much of the American West from the 9th to 16th centuries [see ( 3 ) for a review]. The southwestern region of the United States (hereinafter referred to as the Southwest) represents one of the main foci of megadrought activity, the occurrence of which profoundly affected organized societies of the time as well as the landscape and vegetation across the area ( 3 ). The absence of any megadroughts after the 16th century in the Southwest raises critical questions surrounding their causes, their predominant clustering during the Medieval period, and whether there is a substantial risk of these droughts returning in the near future as a consequence of either natural or anthropogenic causes ( 4 , 5 ).

RESULTS

Here, we use a newly available reconstruction product in tandem with a global forcing estimate to directly test the association between Southwest megadroughts and the larger oceanic and radiative forcing conditions. The Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA) is a physically and internally consistent reconstruction product that provides gridded hydroclimate and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) globally over the Common era in addition to hydroclimatically relevant dynamical indices. PHYDA is a probabilistic estimate of the time-varying state of the climate over the past 2000 years based on a fusion of both a global climate model and a global collection of proxy time series [see Materials and Methods and (27) for more information about the construction of PHYDA]. Using the probabilistic, ensemble reconstructions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) from PHYDA, we identify 14 decadal-scale droughts, called megadroughts herein, in the Southwest during the period 800–1925 (see Materials and Methods); all highly probable megadroughts occur before the year 1600 [>99% ensemble agreement (fig. S1A) and in agreement with (3)]. Therefore, we generally split our analyses into pre- and post-1600 periods.

We find that megadroughts are associated with unusually cold values of the NINO3.4 index, with megadrought periods shifted to colder temperatures (Fig. 1D) especially for the lower percentiles of the NINO3.4 probability density functions (Fig. 1G), although there is no discernible shift in the mean state of NINO3.4. The North Atlantic was consistently warmer during megadroughts (Fig. 1, E and H), indicative of a large-scale state shift during the period 800–1600 relative to a reference period of 1601–1925 (Fig. 1, E and H, and fig. S2); this state shift is consistent with the well-known global cooling trend over the preindustrial Common era (28). These SST results in Fig. 1 are insensitive to the choice of drought definition [(29) versus (10)] and the choice of annual or seasonal climate indices [annual versus JJA (June, July, and August) Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index and monthly versus DJF (December, January, and February) versus annual NINO3.4 index]. Such a lack of seasonal dependence is likely because the AMO index from 800 to 1600 is elevated across all seasons and the extremes in the NINO3.4 index are dominated by the DJF months, the peak season of ENSO. We also find that the forced climate response (derived from an energy balance model and historical forcing estimates; see Materials and Methods) consists of fluctuations of warmer global mean temperatures during megadroughts relative to the 1601–1925 reference period (Fig. 1, F and I); these warmer temperatures are a result of periods of quiescent volcanoes and elevated solar forcing, filtered by the long-term memory of the deep ocean (fig. S3B).

(D to F) Probability density functions (PDFs) of temperature for the NINO3.4, AMO, and forcing estimate during the reference years of 1601–1925 (teal), all the states during each of the megadroughts (orange), and the remaining nondrought segments from 800 to 1600 (black). NINO3.4 and AMO PDFs are for the full reconstruction ensemble from PHYDA, while the forcing PDF is for the full ensemble forcing estimate (see Materials and Methods). (G to I) Change in percentiles of the PDFs shown in (D) to (F) relative to the corresponding 1601–1925 reference PDF. Percentile changes show which parts of the megadrought and nondrought distributions change relative to the reference distribution.

To assess the relative importance of these climate drivers in explaining hydroclimate in the Southwest, we performed a decadal-scale linear regression analysis over the period 800–1925 using detrended indices (see Materials and Methods). On a decadal time scale, the NINO3.4 index explains the most variance of Southwest PDSI (up to 30%), while the AMO and radiative forcing each explain, on average, less than half the variance explained by the NINO3.4 index (Fig. 2A). When multiple predictors are included, there is a small improvement in explained variance, but the dominant factor is the decadal NINO3.4 index (Fig. 2A). Note that our analysis here focuses on large-scale climate phenomena that act on the annual to multiyear time scales. Other shorter-scale climate phenomena, such as stochastic synoptic variability, likely contribute to drought and megadrought in the Southwest (6), but from the perspective of the paleoclimate record, the time history of these phenomena is very likely unrecoverable. Such phenomena likely account for the unexplained variance in these regressions.

(A) The bootstrap distributions of adjusted r2 for the decadal linear regression of the predictand North American Southwest PDSI (NASW PDSI) and the predictors of NINO3.4 (or N), AMO (or A), and total forcing (Forc or F) (see Materials and Methods). For this and the other panels in this figure, the central box mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers (outliers not shown for clarity). (B) Bootstrap distributions of adjusted r2 for the decadal linear regression with the predictands of NINO3.4, AMO, and NASW averaged 2-m temperature (T2m) and the predictor of total forcing (see Materials and Methods). (C) Bootstrap regression β 1 parameter distributions for the same regressions as shown in (B) (see Materials and Methods). Here and in (D), the numbers at the top indicate the whole percentage of data points below and above zero (below:above). (D) Bootstrap distributions of β 1 regression parameter values for a logistic regression binned over megadroughts (see Materials and Methods); here, the predictand is the binary variable of either being in a megadrought or not, while the predictors are the NINO3.4, AMO, and forcing indices. The suffix “All” indicates regressions with all data points, and the suffix “NLV” (or no large volcanoes) indicates regressions with outlier volcanic eruption bins removed for all variables (see Materials and Methods). (E) Percentage of bootstrap regressions for which a particular logistic regression model has a minimum information criterion, suggesting that it is the best of the tested models (see Materials and Methods). “AIC” is the Akaike information criterion corrected for the sample size, and “BIC” is the Bayesian information criterion. The regression models all use the megadrought predictand with different combinations of the predictors NINO3.4, AMO, and total forcing (see Materials and Methods).

We also tested the influence of radiative forcing on the NINO3.4 index in the decadal regression framework as a measure of the potential influence of a dynamical thermostat mechanism (7); within this framework, we find no influence of radiative forcing on the NINO3.4 index (Fig. 2B). In contrast, however, we do find that a small, similar amount of variance in both the AMO and local Southwest temperature can be explained by radiative forcing (Fig. 2B). For the Southwest, we interpret the locally forced response as a straightforward mechanism: A global-scale positive radiative forcing leads to an increase in local temperatures, which, in turn, lead to an increase in aridity. In the temperature units of the global forcing estimate, the median local temperature response is 0.12°C; on a decadal time scale, this would represent a decrease in Southwest PDSI of about 0.17 (using the linear relationship between decadal, detrended temperature, and PDSI over the Southwest from 800 to 1925; Fig. 2C). This forced PDSI response is only a fraction of the PDSI excursions seen in PHYDA megadroughts of approximately −1 PDSI (fig. S1D); yet, a forced PDSI value of 0.17 is about half the value required for a proposed mean state shift in Southwest PDSI seen in the North American Drought Atlas during the Medieval megadrought period (22).

After exploring the drivers of decadal hydroclimate in the American Southwest generally, we now turn to the causes of megadroughts specifically. For this, we use a logistic regression framework, given that we are treating megadroughts as binary events. We find that megadroughts are most robustly associated with cold NINO3.4 conditions and warm AMO conditions, with the influence of NINO3.4 being again more than twice as important (Fig. 2D; here, the predictors have been standardized, thus allowing for a direct comparison of regression parameter values). The role of a positive radiative forcing is less certain: Approximately three-fifths of the bootstrap regression parameter estimates are positive when four outlier large volcanic eruption data points are removed (β 1 distribution for “Forc-NLV” in Fig. 2D; see Materials and Methods). Large volcanic eruptions (negative forcing) appear to have no consistent temporal relationship to megadroughts, with, for example, volcanic eruptions bookending a megadrought in the mid-1200s or occurring in the middle of a megadrought in the late 1400s (Fig. 1C). However, 9 of 14 megadroughts are associated with a positive shift in radiative forcing (Fig. 1, F and I), caused in the energy balance model by elevated solar forcing and volcanic quiescence (fig. S3B). Additionally, a positive radiative forcing on drought is supported by the linear regression analysis in Fig. 2C. To test whether the positive forcing response in the regression model could be consistent with a null variable, we reran the logistic regressions including a Gaussian random predictor; we found that the β 1 distribution for Forc-NLV in Fig. 2D was statistically distinct from that of the random predictor (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with n = 999 and α = 0.01). Given all this evidence and the simplicity of a positive forcing mechanism, we argue that a positive radiative forcing influence on megadroughts is more likely than a negative radiative forcing or no forcing influence at all.

Considering the joint influence of NINO3.4, AMO, and radiative forcing in causing megadroughts, we find that the logistic regression model that has the highest probability of being the most explanatory is the one that includes all three of these climate drivers (Fig. 2E); this is indicated by two different information criteria, both of which include a penalty for adding predictors. These logistic regression results are also consistent with the SST and forcing excursions shown in Fig. 1, D to I. We therefore argue that Southwest megadroughts were primarily driven by anomalously frequent and cold, unforced La Niña conditions, with contributions from a partially forced warm Atlantic and a forced local temperature increase.

The analysis shown in Figs. 1 and 2 assumes from the outset that the specific NINO3.4 and AMO indices are suitable for uncovering the mechanisms of megadroughts. While the choices of these indices are not without warrant based on past work, we nevertheless seek to confirm our results without assuming the form of the variables driving megadroughts. Climate pattern frequency analysis using self-organizing maps (SOMs) (30) (see Materials and Methods) reveals spatial SST patterns that are consistent with the Pacific and Atlantic forcing conditions shown previously. The SOM analysis specifically demonstrates a robust increased incidence of cold central and eastern Pacific SSTs during megadroughts relative to the 1601–1925 reference period, with the responses for the stronger nodes 1 and 2 being the most distinct compared to the reference range [Fig. 3, A and B (nodes 1, 2, and 4), and figs. S4, A and B (node 2), and S5, A and B (nodes 1 to 3)]; these specific patterns are concomitant with dry conditions across the western United States, with the strongest SST patterns generally having the most consistently dry PDSI values. Note that these SOM patterns are emergent properties of the underlying dataset, are not imposed a priori, and have no explicit dependence or knowledge of Southwest megadrought conditions. The greatest pattern increases are associated with cold Pacific SSTs co-occurring with areas of warm Atlantic SSTs, although there is some sensitivity to the precise pattern of warm Atlantic SSTs (cf. Fig. 3A, node 2, and fig. S5A, nodes 2 and 3). We note, however, that because of required data preprocessing and detrending (see Materials and Methods), the warming shift in the Atlantic associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly is partially removed in this SOM analysis. During megadroughts, there was also a robust reduction of some warm Pacific SST patterns (Fig. 3, A and B, nodes 5 and 8), which are concomitant with wetting across the western United States. These results, of an increased frequency in cold Pacific SSTs coupled with warming in the Atlantic and dry conditions in the Southwest, are robust to the choice of the number of SOM nodes (figs. S4 and S5) and drought definition [(29) versus (10)]. These results are also consistent with a basic compositing analysis across the megadroughts (fig. S6). The SOM analysis also confirms that the dominant climate driver of megadroughts is unusual periods of La Niña conditions.",2019-07-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['methods', 'forcing', 'medieval', 'southwest', 'materials', 'radiative', 'regression', 'american', 'nino34', 'megadroughts', 'amo', 'fig', 'oceanic']",Ghana,news article,English

879,DR-2011-000121-CHN,U.S. experiences second warmest summer on record: Texas has warmest summer on record of any state - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110910134446.htm,"The blistering heat experienced by the United States during August, as well as the June through August months, marks the second warmest summer on record, according to scientists at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, N.C. The persistent heat, combined with below-average precipitation across the southern U.S. during August and the three summer months, continued a record-breaking drought across the region.

The average U.S. temperature in August was 75.7 degrees F, which is 3.0 degrees above the long-term (1901-2000) average, while the summertime temperature was 74.5 degrees F, which is 2.4 degrees above average. The warmest August on record for the contiguous United States was 75.8 degrees F in 1983, while its warmest summer on record at 74.6 degrees F occurred in 1936. Precipitation across the nation during August averaged 2.31 inches, 0.29 inches below the long-term average. The nationwide summer precipitation was 1.0 inch below average.

This monthly analysis, based on records dating back to 1895, is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides.

U.S. climate highlights -- August

Excessive heat in six states -- Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana -- resulted in their warmest August on record. This year ranked in the top ten warmest August for five other states: Florida (3rd), Georgia (4th), Utah (5th), Wyoming (8th), and South Carolina (9th).The Southwest and South also had their warmest August on record.

Only nine of the lower 48 states experienced August temperatures near average, and no state had August average temperatures below average.

Wetter-than-normal conditions were widespread across the Northeastern United States, which had its second wettest August, as well as parts of the Northern Plains and California. Drier-than-normal conditions reigned across the interior West, the Midwest, and the South.

Hurricane Irene made landfall near Cape Lookout, N.C. as a Category 1 storm on August 27, marking the first hurricane landfall in the U.S. since Hurricane Ike in September 2008. Irene made a second landfall in New Jersey as a hurricane on August 28, marking only the second recorded hurricane landfall in that state.

Irene contributed to New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire having their wettest August on record. Meanwhile, Massachusetts (2nd), Connecticut (2nd), Delaware (3rd), Maine (3rd), Maryland (5th), Pennsylvania (5th), and Rhode Island (9th) had a top 10 wet August.

Several major U.S. cities broke all-time monthly rainfall amounts during August. New York City (Central Park) measured 18.95 inches of rain, exceeding the previous record of 16.85 inches in 1882. In Philadelphia, 19.31 inches of rain was observed, besting the previous monthly record of 13.07 inches in September 1999.

Louisiana (3rd), Tennessee (4th), Texas (5th), Mississippi (6th), Georgia, (6th), Illinois (8th), Washington (9th), and Alabama (9th) had precipitation totals among their top ten driest on record.

Despite record rainfall in parts of the country, drought covered about one-third of the contiguous United States, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index indicated that parts of Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas are experiencing drought of greater intensity, but not yet duration, than those of the 1930s and 1950s. Drought intensity refers to the rate at which surface and ground water is lost, due to a combination of several factors, including evaporation and lack of precipitation.

An analysis of Texas statewide tree-ring records dating back to 1550 indicates that the summer 2011 drought in Texas is matched by only one summer (1789), indicating that the summer 2011 drought appears to be unusual even in the context of the multi-century tree-ring record.

U.S. climate highlights -- Summer

Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Louisiana had their warmest (June-August) summers on record. Average summer temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma, at 86.8 degrees F and 86.5 degrees F, respectively, exceeded the previous seasonal statewide average temperature record for any state during any season. The previous warmest summer statewide average temperature was in Oklahoma, during 1934 at 85.2 degrees F.

Fifteen states had a summer average temperature ranking among their top ten warmest. West of the Rockies, a persistent trough brought below-average temperatures to the Pacific Northwest, where Washington and Oregon were the only states across the lower 48 to have below-average summer temperatures.

Texas had its driest summer on record, with a statewide average of 2.44 inches of rain. This is 5.29 inches below the long-term average, and 1.04 inches less than the previous driest summer in 1956. New Mexico had its second driest summer and Oklahoma its third driest summer. New Jersey and California had their wettest summers on record with 22.50 inches and 1.93 inches, respectively.

The U.S. Climate Extremes Index, a measure of the percent area of the country experiencing extreme climate conditions, was nearly four times the average value was during summer 2011. This is the third largest summer value of the record, which dates to 1910. The major drivers were extremes in warm minimum and maximum temperatures and in the wet and dry tails of the Palmer Drought Severity Index.

Based on NOAA's Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index, the contiguous U.S. temperature-related energy demand was 22.3 percent above average during summer. This is the largest such value during the index's period of record, which dates to 1895.

Other U.S. climate highlights

During the six-month period (March-August), much-above-average temperatures dominated the southern and eastern United States. New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, all experienced their warmest March-August on record. Cooler-than-average temperatures dominated the West and Northwest.

For the year-to-date period, the average statewide temperature for Texas was 69.9 degrees F, the warmest such period on record for the state. This bests the previous record for the year-to-date period of 69.8 degrees F in 2000.",2011-09-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['warmest', 'degrees', 'drought', 'second', 'state', 'texas', 'states', 'experiences', 'summer', 'record', 'f', 'average', 'inches']",China,news article,English

(FPRI) — When Islamist insurgents laid siege to the coastal town of Palma in gas-rich northeastern Mozambique on March 24, leaving dozens dead, including several foreigners, the story received international attention. The insurgency in Mozambique is being waged by a group that calls itself al-Shabaab—not to be confused with the Somali group of the same name—and is affiliated with the Islamic State’s (ISIS) Central Africa Province. Despite the recent flood of attention al-Shabaab in Mozambique has received, the insurgency is not new.

A local religious group called Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaa (ASWJ) turned toward militancy around 2015, eventually renaming itself (in whole or in part) al-Shabaab. The militant group has engaged in insurgent fighting against Mozambique’s government since late 2017. Al-Shabaab has not been particularly outspoken about the goals of its insurgency, but it has articulated a desire to establish rule by a hardline version of Islamic law in Cabo Delgado. The group’s aims appear to center on undermining and degrading the Mozambican government’s military and political authority, gaining local support, and combating foreign interests in Cabo Delgado.

Religious and ethnic tensions, alongside poor regional economic conditions, are also reportedly prominent factors motivating the violence. The militants are believed by local leaders and community members to be primarily “disaffected youth motivated by complex political, economic, and social factors including feelings of marginalization and disagreements with religious authorities in Cabo Delgado,” according to the most recent U.S. Department of State Report on International Religious Freedom.

Mozambique is a Christian-majority country, but around 18% of citizens are Muslim, primarily residing in the north, including in Cabo Delgado province, where most of the violence has occurred. Fundamentalist forms of Islam have spread in the country over the past several decades and have largely been at odds with local political and religious authorities. Additionally, the Mwani ethnic group—a Muslim-majority ethnic group that has a large presence in Cabo Delgado—has long viewed itself as politically and economically marginalized by the Christian-majority Makonde ethnic group in the region. These religious and ethnic tensions have converged with low levels of economic opportunity in Cabo Delgado, which is considered one of the poorest regions in Mozambique.

Origins of Militant Activity in Mozambique

Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaa was founded by Mozambican and Tanzanian religious leaders with links to Salafist circles in Tanzania, Kenya, and Somalia. Various local sources say the group’s early leadership included locals who studied religious doctrine and received military training in Tanzania, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia.

Early Influences and Recruitment. Accounts from locals note that one of ASWJ’s early influences was the teaching of Aboud Rogo Mohammed, an extremist cleric from Kenya designated by the United Nations for providing support to Somalia’s al-Shabaab. Rogo was killed in Kenya in 2012, but his influence lives on. ASWJ’s leaders reportedly gave lectures inspired by Rogo and distributed videos of his speeches, along with other militant propaganda. Some members of Mozambique’s al-Shabaab were followers of Rogo in Kenya who resettled in Mozambique after his death.

ASWJ’s leaders appear to have originally recruited poor or unemployed youth by offering them small loans. Recruits could invest their loans in any sector, including the illicit economy, to help them build wealth through business opportunities. ASWJ leaders were likely able to lure recruits into these business ventures by capitalizing on both “long-standing feelings of marginalization” and “issues of youth unemployment and poverty.”

Transition to Militancy. ASWJ began its transition toward militancy by mobilizing in mosques against established religious leaders, a pattern that can be discerned elsewhere in militant Salafist social mobilizations. ASWJ members reportedly began causing disruptions at mosques, criticizing local Muslims for not adequately abiding by Islamic law. Some members reportedly threatened to kill local religious leaders.

After these confrontations with local religious leaders, the group began to shift from a religious organization to a militant group. Around 2015, ASWJ leaders began setting up training camps in northern districts of Cabo Delgado and created a decision-making council that was reportedly responsible for crafting military strategy. Locals interviewed by the Mozambique-based Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Económicos say that the group began recruiting youth from Tanzania and the Great Lakes region. These foreign recruits trained locals in military techniques.

October 2017 marked ASWJ’s transition to being an overtly militant group. It launched a series of attacks against police posts, killing two officers and briefly overrunning the strategic port of Mocimboa da Praia. In the following months, the militants carried out arson attacks on villages in Cabo Delgado that killed and wounded several civilians. Locals reported that some members of the group sold off their stock and businesses around this time (much of which had been built using loans from ASWJ leaders) and left their homes to travel to Mocimboa da Praia. The group likely began referring to itself as al-Shabaab at this point. There are no indications that Mozambique’s al-Shabaab is affiliated with Somali militant group of the same name, but there have been some suggestions of a connection between militants in Mozambique and Somalia. For example, some locals reported that children who were members of the Mozambican group disappeared for several months leading up to the October 2017 attacks, traveling to Somalia during this period to “participate in jihad” and study the Islamic faith.

Escalation of the al-Shabaab Insurgency in Mozambique

Since its turn to overt militancy in 2017, al-Shabaab has grown into an established insurgency, in some places openly controlling territory.

Nascent Insurgency. The group operated as a nascent insurgency in Cabo Delgado through 2018. It carried out intermittent small-scale operations, an estimated 120 incidents that killed 38 people between January and November 2018. This initial phase of insurgency represented a building period.

The following year, al-Shabaab intensified the scale and scope of its operations, carrying out more than 150 attacks that killed over 450 people during the same reporting period. The reasons for the escalation in 2019 are not clear, but there are indications that the group began organizing with ISIS-linked militants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) around this time.

At the beginning of 2019, news reports began to suggest that al-Shabaab was organizing training and operations with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militant group that has been waging a decades-long insurgency in eastern DRC and Uganda. Mozambican authorities arrested several Ugandan militants (likely associated with ADF) who were suspected of involvement in attacks in Cabo Delgado. A few months later, in March 2019, regional news outlets reported that an ADF offshoot, Madinat Tawhid-wa-l-Muwahidin (MTM), had opened a cell in northern Mozambique.

Affiliation with ISIS. Clear indications of al-Shabaab and ADF’s affiliation with ISIS emerged around this time, though murkier indications of a connection between the two groups and ISIS had already surfaced in 2017-18, primarily in online forums and jihadist propaganda. In April 2019, ISIS announced the formation of the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) after claiming responsibility for an attack launched by ADF militants in the DRC. Not long after, in June 2019, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack perpetrated by al-Shabaab in Mozambique, thus formally incorporating al-Shabaab into ISCAP.

There remains a fair amount of uncertainty about the role being played by foreign ISIS actors in Mozambique and the DRC. However, it is clear that since becoming integrated into ISCAP, al-Shabaab has significantly stepped up its operations and has begun to overtake and control territory. In August 2020, it captured Mocimboa da Praia, where it has continued to exert control. Al-Shabaab’s attacks have also become increasingly frequent and brutal, often displaying trademark ISIS tactics like beheadings. Between January and November 2020, the group was responsible for over 400 violent incidents that left more than 1,300 people dead. This is a substantial increase compared to the same reporting period in previous years. Al-Shabaab’s assault against the city of Palma in March/April 2021 shows that the militant threat is enduring, and it seems, growing more dire by the week.

Al-Shabaab also has likely grown in size since becoming affiliated with ISIS. Though many members are local Mozambicans and Tanzanians, the group also includes foreign elements, which likely include foreigners who traveled to fight with the group, as well as those who resettled in Mozambique looking for work. For the most part, the group’s foreign members come from Somalia and the Great Lakes region. Some reports have claimed that individuals from the Middle East and South Asia are present as well, but local sources have mainly reported that the fighters speak local languages.

Factors Hospitable to Insurgency

Whether al-Shabaab in Mozambique will sustain its operational tempo remains to be seen, but several factors suggest that the conditions in Mozambique are favorable to a prolonged insurgency, including geography and terrain and weak security forces.

Geography & Terrain. Mozambique is located on the southeastern coast of Africa, and Cabo Delgado is its northernmost province, bordering Tanzania. Forests and islands in Cabo Delgado offer valuable opportunities to an insurgency. The region is covered by dense forests and shrublands, which have provided the militants cover from counterterrorism operations and air raids. One media outlet reported that local residents who had been abducted by militants and later escaped described the base where they had been held as “located amid vegetation so dense that the place is always dark, necessitating the permanent use of lamps and lanterns, even during the day.” Cabo Delgado’s islands, many of which are thinly inhabited or even uninhabited, have reportedly served as training bases and points from which the militants can strategically position themselves against security forces.

Counterterrorism & Security Forces. The Mozambique Defense and Security Forces are largely incapable of countering the insurgency, lacking both adequate resources and the capabilities to contain militant activity or protect civilians. Given these deficiencies, the government of Mozambique has contracted private military companies—Wagner Group (Russia) and Dyck Advisory Group (South Africa)—to provide paramilitary assistance, including aerial support. Self-defense militias have also reportedly tried to protect civilians. After the Palma siege, the African Union called for “urgent action” to quell the fighting.

Conclusion

Though much foreign interest in Mozambique is centered around Cabo Delgado’s natural resources, outside interest also focuses on regional stability and spillover violence. The South Africa Development Community, an inter-governmental organization of countries in the Southern Africa region (including Mozambique), called for regional action on Mozambique last year since the insurgency poses “a serious threat to regional peace and stability.” In September 2020, Mozambique asked the European Union for military training and other assistance.

At various points, the insurgents have targeted contractors associated with liquefied natural gas projects, and have moved in recent months to close in on areas where these companies operate. There is the potential for foreign involvement, especially after recent attacks, and the United States has roughly a dozen Green Berets in country to train the Mozambican security forces. There is the possibility for a prolonged insurgency that could draw foreign fighters to the region, with the potential to spread into neighboring countries.

Its path is expected to pass over the northern tip of the Comoros islands on 24 April and continue onward to northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania. It is expected to make landfall in the district of Palma in Mozambique on 25 April...The Global Disaster Alert Coordination System (GDACS) has issued an orange alert for the Cyclone, meaning a medium humanitarian impact is expected based on the storm strength and its forecasted path. According to UNOSAT, the entire population of Comoros (758,339) is within the Cyclone’s windspeed zones, with Grand Comore the primary concern. In Mozambique, more than 747,000 people are living within the Cyclone’s path, mainly in Cabo Delgado Province, including a projected 117,000 living in high wind speed zones. (OCHA, 24 Apr 2019)

The official death toll from the impact of Tropical Cyclone Kenneth in northern Mozambique has risen to 38 people, according to the Government. Nearly 35,000 houses have either been partially destroyed (32,034) or totally destroyed (2,930), according to the Government ... More than 570 mm of rain has been recorded since 25 April in Pemba, the highest in Cabo Delgado. (OCHA, 29 Apr 2019)

More than 27,000 people have been reached with food assistance since Cyclone Kenneth made landfall on 25 April 2019. International deliveries of shelter supplies began to arrive in Pemba on 1 May 2019; more flights are scheduled in the days ahead. The number of people affected by Tropical Cyclone Kenneth has risen to more than 384,800, with an estimated 185,000 people affected in Comoros and at least 199,836 affected in Mozambique. The risk of water-borne diseases is high, with many areas still without access to clean water following the cyclone. (OCHA, 2 May 2019)

From 9 to 17 September, in close coordination with Mozambique’s National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), IOM DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix) teams conducted baseline assessments at locality level (localidade), the findings were as follows:

- All the affected population remain within the same locality;

- More than 160,000 people whose homes were affected by shelter damage have stayed inside their locality;

- In Cabo Delgado, reported a displaced population who have not returned to their locality of origin estimated at around 1,000 individuals and 200 households;

- The number of returned populations who have returned to their locality of origin represents nearly 2,500 people and around 500 households.

Nearly 50% of the country is currently facing drought with at least 16% falling in the “exceptional” or “extreme” category, according to IIT Gandhinagar scientists managing India’s real time drought prediction system.

This ongoing drought will pose a lot of challenges in water availability this summer, Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Gandhinagar, told PTI.

The real-time monitoring system run by his team, which includes Ph.D. student Amardeep Tiwari, collects weather and precipitation data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is then used to simulate soil moisture and other factors that contribute to drought.

The results of the simulations, prepared by the Water and Climate Lab at IIT Gandhinagar, are available on the website of the IMD.

“About 47% of the country is facing drought — with 16% facing extreme, or exceptional category of drought — which we show from our real time monitoring system that we have developed for the country,” said Mr. Mishra, who heads the lab.

“Arunachal Pradesh did not get good rain this year, and parts of Jharkhand, southern Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and northern part of Tamil Nadu are under drought,” Mr. Mishra said.

If these areas experience very hot summer before the onset of monsoon, it could lead to a crisis, he warned.

According to him, continuing drought will further burden the already depleting groundwater resources of the country.

“We are not enhancing groundwater recharge. On the other hand, drought conditions are making us extract more and more water,” he said.

While famine-like conditions are not expected, the drought will have a massive impact on the economy.

“It can create long-term stress, if not mortality for poor, marginalised farmers,” Mr. Mishra said.

The scientist said global warming and climate change are likely to exacerbate drought in the coming years.

Difficult situation ahead

“If our groundwater is not recharged and managed sustainably, we could face a very difficult situation in the coming years,” Mr. Mishra said, adding that groundwater is being used irresponsibly at present.

“You can reduce groundwater by selecting appropriate crops. If we already have depleted groundwater we should not grow water-intensive crops. For example, Punjab should not be growing rice,” Mr. Mishra said.

“The government needs to take some tough decisions as far as groundwater, and water conservation is concerned,” Mr. Mishra said.

Conserving water in urban homes is just a drop in the bucket compared to steps that can be taken in the agriculture sector, he said.

“Of course, conservation should be encouraged at every level, but the elephant in the room is agriculture. 80% of our total fresh water is used in agriculture sites, rather than residential sites,” he said.

He also stressed the need to equip ourselves better to tackle a drought situation,

“The government thinks drought is a reactive situation, that they will provide a relief only once there is a crisis But with the data available they can take proactive measures to prevent a water crisis,” Mr. Mishra said.",2019-02-28 08:00:00+00:00,"['india', 'facing', 'situation', 'nearly', 'water', 'drought', 'currently', 'mr', 'groundwater', 'country', 'used', '50', 'scientists', 'mishra', 'iit', 'gandhinagar']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Maharashtra received 21 per cent above rainfall in June, while Marathwada outperformed the other meteorological sub-divisions in the state with 57 per cent surplus rainfall.

Even though cyclone Nisarga, which hit Raighad district on June 3, caused significant damage to property and livelihood of people living along coastal districts, the associated rainfall eventually contributed to the surplus in the state in June.

The monsoon then entered a weak phase before activity picked up last week.

The rainfall figures for June are Madhya Maharashtra (48 per cent), Konkan and Goa (3 per cent) and Vidarbha (-1 per cent).

The India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall over Pune, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Satara districts between July 2 and July 4.

‘Winds accompanying lightning can aggravate hazards’

Strong winds at the time of thunderstorm and lightning events can aggravate destruction and damage even leading to greater loss of life, said Soma Sen Roy, scientist, Nowcast Department, National Weather Forecasting Centre at IMD, Delhi.

She was speaking on ‘Thunderstorm, Duststorms and Lightning’ as part of a webinar series organised by the Ministry of Earth Sciences on Tuesday. Last week, lightning strikes killed more than 100 people in Bihar. According to Roy, lightning and thunderstorm events are prone to occur in the June to September period over Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and northeastern regions.

Higher casualties are linked with more farmers in the fields who are involved in sowing activities. “Predicting thunderstorms poses great challenges as there are still gaps in sharing forecast information to the last person.

382,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Water shortages worsen in Afghanistan as drought persists - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/23/water-shortages-worsen-in-afghanistan-as-drought-persists,"More than the two million Afghans affected as La Nina has devastating effect on the planting season.

Afghans are facing water shortages due to the persistent drought that has ravaged the country this year.

In many places, including the capital Kabul, local residents have to carry containers to fill at water points several times a day.

”Water used to be available 24 hours every day, but now it is only available three to four hours. More than 500 families gather here to get water during these few hours,” said Sayed Ali, a local resident.

In the past year, the amount of precipitation dropped by more than 50 percent compared with that of average levels in most parts of Afghanistan. Sixteen out of 34 provinces are suffering from drought.

This year is even worse. La Nina has had a devastating effect on the planting season, with a rain, snow and sleet deficit of 70 percent prevailing across most of the country.

In the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, nearly 15 million people rely on farming, livestock or labour opportunities in agriculture. Of these, an estimated 2 million people will become severely food insecure due to the drought.

According to the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, about two million Afghans have been affected by the drought. Years of conflict have damaged the country’s infrastructure, making the situation even worse.

”Afghanistan lacks infrastructure. The construction of water projects including dams has been slow. So when water flows past Afghanistan, there is no way to store it and just let it flow right into neighbouring countries,” said Aslam Sayas, the deputy director of Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority.

Local media say the drought has caused a fall in crop production in the western and northern parts of Afghanistan, and people in these areas are on the edge of famine.

595,Drought Sri Lanka,Tomato prices go through the roof as drought hits crop - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tomato-prices-go-through-the-roof-as-drought-hits-crop/article26985240.ece,"Vegetable prices have almost doubled

As the vegetable-growing belt around the city reels from a severe drought, the crops have failed and the supply of produce has fallen drastically, pushing the prices of vegetables upwards.

Tomatoes, especially, have turned into a costly commodity and a kilo costs between ₹45 and ₹60, up from ₹24 to ₹30 for a kilo two weeks ago.

“There is no supply of tomatoes in the market and it is down by over 70%,” said a senior procurement official of a reputed retail chain in the city.

Drought in A.P.

The drought in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh as well has further aggravated the market situation.

G.R. Srinivasan, director, HOPCOMS, said that most borewells have dried up and many areas did not receive rain in the recent spell around Ugadi, creating an acute shortage of water.

Papa Reddy, a tomato farmer from Kolar, said most plants had wilted away as temperatures soared and there is a severe shortage of water.

A few farmers have found a way to beat this – water the plants through tankers.

“Most farmers now have dug sumps in the fields in which they store water through tankers – around five tankers per week. Each tanker of 6,000 litres costs ₹600. This has only driven up the input cost manifold, which is reflected in the selling price as well,” he said, adding that he could not sustain buying water through tankers any more and had stopped it two weeks back.

“Tomatoes are a three-month crop and the present crop has failed causing huge losses to farmers. We will sow the next crop in a couple of weeks in time for the onset of monsoon,” he said, indicating that it may be a couple of months before the supply of tomatoes resumes.

The prices of other vegetables have also remained high. For instance, a kilo of beans costs around ₹100. However, this is down from the ₹120 to ₹130 levels from three weeks ago.

Carrots, capsicum, and brinjals cost in the range of ₹60 a kilo. The only saving grace has been the low prices of onions and potatoes – both being sold in the range of ₹20 – ₹25.",2019-04-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'crop', 'supply', 'tankers', 'roof', 'vegetables', 'water', 'drought', 'tomato', 'weeks', 'kilo', 'prices', 'hits', 'costs']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Their numbers are spectacular, at the height of their history, but we have the goal of always: make a great match, regardless of the stage. It will be difficult”. The coach did not want to analyze the situation of the possible sanctioning of Neymar and expressed his confidence in the squad: “We are more than capable to supply Busquets, it is normal for a player to see cards”

“Sergio Busquets is a crucial player for us; just look at his statistics and you will understand how important he is. However, suspensions are normal in a competition like this and we must be ready to replace him in the best possible way”. Enrique explained.

Regarding the final of Berlin, he has warned that “it is a positive memory, but it will have nothing to do with the final” and considers that the defeat of Malaga does not have to be a spur: “At this point the player already Is more than attentive. It’s very attractive the competition, and more face the semifinals, I do not think I have to see what happened before. ” He also believes that 6-1 has little to do now: “Notros we have no previous results, eight teams are in quarters and it will depend on who develops a better game, which is more successful in the areas … Of many details.

I have watched many Juve matches and they are always trying to impose their own game in every part of the pitch. They will do the same tomorrow, but you must put that question to Allegri. I can only tell you what we will do. We will try to win, as we always do. I have only good memories of my experience in Italy. I had the chance to experience a new culture which I enjoyed a lot.

There are a few different players compared to the Berlin final. Juve are still a great team, but I cannot say if they are better or worse than two years ago. I have great memories of that final, but this game is completely different. Both sides are definitely confident about their chances. I certainly don’t need to motivate players for a quarter-final against a team like Juventus.

He has defended André Gomes and does not think it fair to blame him.For him Barça played well against Sevilla and also in Malaga: “Both games were good matches.

487,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia: Humanitarian leadership declares drought - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-leadership-declares-drought,"(Mogadishu, 25 April 2021) – Based on observed drought conditions and rainfall forecasts, the Federal Government of Somalia and the humanitarian community are deeply concerned about the deterioration of the dry conditions in Somalia which has now escalated to a drought situation.

More than 80 per cent of the country is experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. Although the Gu rains started in some parts of the country, forecasts indicate below-average rainfall. Limited rainfall amounts are expected in May and June with larger parts of Somaliland, Puntland, central regions and Gedo region being the worst affected.

“Somalia experiences a cyclical pattern of drought every five to six years and the failure of the rains thus far spells disaster. At a time when communities are already struggling to cope with the recent water shortages in many parts of the country, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and already dire humanitarian situation in the country, many lives are at stake,” said Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Khadija Diriye.

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. Since 1990, Somalia has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. In 2021, drought conditions are expected to increase displacement and have a lasting negative impact on livelihoods and food security outcomes. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by the end of 2021, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced.

The loss of livelihoods forces families to rely on increasingly severe coping mechanisms, worsened by political instability, armed conflict and forced displacement. “We are at the brink of a human catastrophe amidst an already dire humanitarian situation,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator, Adam Abdelmoula. “The cost of inaction is far too dire and the time to take action is now. Urgent and immediate collective action, including scaling-up of response and funding, is needed now to mitigate a full-scale disaster.”

The Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) requires US$ 1.09 billion to assist four million people, including more than three million people in acute need. As of today, the HRP is 15 per cent funded.

In immediate response to the Government’s appeal to address the devastating drought conditions in Somalia, the Humanitarian Coordinator released all available SHF funds to launch a targeted drought response allocation. This allocation will provide life-saving response in areas experiencing pre-drought conditions including acute water shortages, causing the death of livestock, escalating hunger and extreme difficulty in growing crops. The crisis is exacerbated by protection risks and limited access to health facilities and basic services. The SHF funds also target underserved and hard to access areas through cluster-specific and integrated projects. Prioritized activities will help address food insecurity and acute water shortages through rehabilitation of dams and construction of water harvesting infrastructure, conditional cash transfers to access food, provision of fodder seeds and training on improved fodder production and management. Other project activities also aim to improve health and nutrition outcomes, through delivery of free basic and life-saving health services, training health care staff and provision of curative and preventative nutrition services.

This SHF allocation is complemented by the two CERF allocations that will allow NGOs and UN early action to save lives, alleviate suffering, reduce displacements, and get assistance out before the situation becomes catastrophic.

231,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Applicability of Force Majeure Clauses in the Aftermath of Hurricane Sandy - The Maritime Executive,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/applicability-of-force-majeure-clauses-in-the-aftermath-of-hurricane-sandy,"Applicability of Force Majeure Clauses in the Aftermath of Hurricane Sandy

Hurricane Sandy was the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, and possibly the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, causing damage in excess of approximately USD 50,000,000,000 and claiming the lives of at least one hundred ninety-three (193) individuals.

On October 28, 2012, the USCG Captain of the Port of New York and New Jersey set port condition YANKEE for all commercial waterways requiring, inter alia: (1) commercial deep draft vessels greater than 500 gross tons to evacuate all port piers by 6:00 p.m. local time; and (2) all vessels to evacuate Bay Ridge, Stapleton, and Gravesend Bay anchorage grounds by 6:00 p.m. local time. On October 29, 2012, Sandy’s storm surge hit New York City flooding streets, tunnels and subway lines and causing massive power outages throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It is estimated that litigation arising out of delays and damages caused by Hurricane Sandy will be voluminous as insurance claims continue to mount and disputes over coverage under various policies have already begun.

As individuals and businesses continue to deal with the effects of Hurricane Sandy, many have questioned the applicability of force majeure clauses in charter party contracts, specifically, whether Hurricane Sandy qualifies as an “Act of God,” excusing the non-performance of one (1) or more parties. While each clause is unique and subject to fact specific review, force majeure clauses, in general, will be upheld by Courts of the United States “to relieve a party from its contractual duties when its performance has been prevented by a force beyond its control or when the purpose of the contract has been frustrated.” Phillips Puerto Rico Core, Inc. v. Tradax Petroleum, Ltd., 782 F.2d 314, 319 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1985) (internal citations omitted).

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals (the Federal Circuit governing New York and Connecticut) and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (covering New Jersey and Pennsylvania), have each held that the burden of demonstrating force majeure is on the party seeking to have its performance excused, and the non-performing party must demonstrate its efforts to perform its contractual duties despite the occurrence of the event that it claims constituted force majeure. Phillips Puerto Rico Core, Inc., 782 F.2d at 319 (citing Gulf Oil Corp. v. FERC, 706 F.2d 444, 452 (3d Cir. 1983), cert denied, 464 U.S. 1038, 79 L. Ed. 2d 164, 104 S. Ct. 698 (1984)). In reviewing whether the non-performing party has met these burdens, the Court will conduct a factual review of the specific language and requirements of the contract and the force majeure clause at issue.

Specific issues which deserve consideration include, inter alia, (1) whether a storm, hurricane or weather event was specifically included in the force majeure clause (for example a hurricane can be treated differently in the U.S. Gulf, an area in which such storms are frequent, as opposed to New York and New Jersey); (2) whether Hurricane Sandy actually caused the non-performance; (3) what are the notice requirements (if any) to declare force majeure; (4) when does the force majeure event end thereby allowing performance to be completed; and/or (5) any obligations of the parties to mitigate damages, including whether steps were (or could have been) taken prior to, during, and after the storm which would have enabled the performance of the contract.

In short, before declaring force majeure, or accepting a force majeure declaration from another party under a particular contract, parties should give close consideration to the causal relationship between the storm and the type of performance for which excusal is sought. If the non-performance of a specific contract was not directly related to Hurricane Sandy, it is arguable that force majeure would not apply.
