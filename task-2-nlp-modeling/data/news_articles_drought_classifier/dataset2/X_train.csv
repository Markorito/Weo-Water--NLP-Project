639,Drought Sri Lanka,How a drought helped this lost village in Aurangabad resurface - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/photos/from-the-rivers-belly/article27248151.ece,"Nanasaheb Avadhoot remembers the day in 1976 when his village — and several others in Maharashtra's Aurangabad district — were swallowed up by the swirling waters of the Godavari when the Jayakwadi dam was constructed in Paithan.

The drought raging in Aurangabad has made the waters recede at Nath Sagar reservoir, and Avadhoot's village Pimpalwadi can be seen again. Now in his 50s, Avadhoot stands on the spot where his house once stood. A broken stone structure brings back memories of the flood — it is one of the few features that has survived the deluge.

The receding waters have uncovered a century-old Narasimha temple, a Hanuman temple, the Pirbaba dargah, a math, the Aurangabad-Paithan road, and a bridge. Shivaji Khillare has often sailed on the river and fished in the reservoir's waters, and he was amazed at the magnificent structures that the riverbed yielded.

He says he has heard stories from his 90-year-old father Rambhau about how Savkheda village submerged when the dam was built. Rambhau spent 30 years in this village before it went under. “I spent my childhood and played with my friends here, sitting on the banks of the Godavari,"" says an emotional Rambhau. “Then the village was asked to vacate, and everything was gone forever.”",2019-05-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['waters', 'aurangabad', 'dam', 'helped', 'village', 'lost', 'drought', 'temple', 'yieldedhe', 'resurface', 'rambhau', 'avadhoot', 'spent', 'godavari']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
707,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The Ducati Scrambler was a bike for hippies — but now it's a motorcycle for hipsters - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ducati-scrambler-bike-hippies-now-160712814.html,"Ducati Scrambler

I recently took a short vacation to Bologna, Italy and while I was there I spent some time at the Ducati factory and museum.

Ducati is a very old motorcycle brand, founded in 1926 and headquartered in Bologna for its entire history.

In recent years, the company has gained renown for its so-called ""naked"" bikes, mainly the Ducati Monster, which was rolled out in 1993 and has achieved widespread popularity (it has an open trellis frame that exposes its unique desmodromic v-twin engine).

Ducati is also well-known for its aggressive superbikes, such as the Panigale — often called the ""Ferrari"" of motorcycles.

But it's biggest hit of late is a reboot of a motorcycle that it first built back in the early 1960s and discontinued in the early 1970s. It was called the ""Scrambler,"" and Ducati resumed making it, with a completely different level of technology and much more horsepower, in 2015.

Ducati Scrambler

I was a big fan of the Monster, but the Scrambler is really just about my favorite bike on the road right now. For Ducati, it gives the brand a bike to put against some of the revived ""cafe racers"" that have been produced by the likes of Triumph and even Harley-Davidson, which is famous for its hulking cruisers.

Triumph's bikes are pure hipster, but the Scrambler nods at a subset of hipsterdom: riders who want to tackle the road and the trail. In this sense, they probably would have appealed to somebody like Steve McQueen, a motorsport nut who actually sampled a whole bunch of dirt bikes for Popular Mechanics in 1966.

The original Ducati Scrambler wasn't on his docket, but it should have been.

Ducati made the original Scrambler for the US market, and if a photo I snapped while I was at the museum is any indication, it was a bike beloved by counterculturalists:

Ducati Scrambler

I'm not sure if the new Ducati is similarly pitched; the target market seems to be especially chic hipsters. In fact, the Scrambler has been so successful that rather than allow it to exist as a single model in the overall Ducati lineup, the company has turned it into a standalone brand selling a variety of different bikes.

Story continues

From a business standpoint, this shows a pretty bold pivot for Ducati. The bike maker is now appealing to several different markets, uniting them with its high-end, design-and-engineering-driven DNA.

As I learned when I stopped by the New York Motorcycle Show last year, American bikers are now absolutely spoiled for choice. There are far more great, modern motorcycles now than there were when I was growing up. Back then, it was essentially cruisers and sport bikes; if you wanted something different, you had to scour the vintage realms.

Nowadays, kickstarting is a thing of past and all these retro-bikes are outfitted with state of the art tech. But as in the case of the Scrambler, they haven't lost their spirit. The bikes of the 1960s and '70s may have appealed to hippies, but there aren't that many of those folks around these days. So a hipster dirt bike with an Italian pedigree is perfect.

Flames roar near Bastrop State Park as a wildfire burns out of control near Bastrop, Texas September 5, 2011. An estimated 1,000 homes are being threatened in Bastrop County, just east of Austin, as a 14,000-acre (5700-hectare) wildfire rages out of control, causing evacuations. [Photo/Agencies]

SAN ANTONIO - Sixty separate wildfires, whipped by strong winds, were burning across Texas on Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and killing at least two people, officials said.

Authorities in Gregg County, in northeast Texas, say a 20-year-old woman and her 18-month-old daughter were killed on Sunday when they were trapped in their mobile home by flames.

The Texas Forest Service estimates 424 homes may have been destroyed so far, including 300 from the so-called Bastrop County Complex fire east of Austin.

Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is running as a Republican presidential candidate, is cutting short his campaigning and returning from South Carolina to Texas on Monday.

""I urge Texans to take extreme caution as we continue to see the devastating effects of sweeping wildfires impacting both rural and urban areas of the state,"" Perry said in a statement.

Perry had been slated to participate in televised forum with other Republican candidates on Monday.

More than 3.6 million acres (1.5 million hectares) in Texas have been scorched by wildfires since November, fed by a continuing drought that has caused more than $5 billion in damage to the state's agricultural industry and shows no sign of easing any time soon.

The Texas Forest Service responded on Sunday to 63 new fires burning on more than 32,000 acres (13,000 hectares), including 22 new large fires.

Officials said the worst of the fires was the Bastrop County Complex fire, which stretched for 16 miles (26 km).

Officials said the fire had jumped a road that they had hoped to set up as a barrier, and has now spread to 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares).

""We have about 16 miles long at this time and about 6 miles wide (10 km),"" said Bastrop County Fire Chief Ronnie McDonald.

Residents said the fire had moved very quickly, driven by the strong, gusty winds.

""It's pretty dire,"" Justice Jones of the Forest Service said on Monday morning.

The Bastrop Complex fire has forced the evacuation of several subdivisions in the county of 70,000 people.

""This is a shock,"" said one man as he drove out of the fire zone near Bastrop with his family. ""We had some nice plans for Labor Day, and this gives you a sick feeling.""

The Texas Forest Service said dozens of aircraft were responding to fires, including four heavy airtankers, 15 single-engine airtankers, and 13 aerial supervision aircraft.

In the Steiner Ranch area of Austin, a separate fire has forced the evacuation of some 1,000 homes. One woman desperately scanned the wall of thick black smoke and flames looking for her lost dog.

""I was just driving around the neighborhood, I'm five months pregnant, and I was taking in smoke and I was freaking out,"" she said. ""I looked to the right of me and everything over there was full of fire, it was just gone.""

About 200 homes had to be evacuated due to a brush fire in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, and about 150 homes were evacuated in Longview, in east Texas. A dozen homes were under mandatory evacuation on Monday near Tyler in east Texas.",2011-09-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['forest', 'near', 'wildfires', 'east', 'destroyed', 'bastrop', 'texas', 'service', 'homes', 'dead', 'county', 'miles']",China,news article,English
646,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to take part in WHO malaria vaccine pilot programme - Malawi - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/ghana-kenya-and-malawi-take-part-who-malaria-vaccine-pilot-programme,"Brazzaville, 24 April 2017 - The World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) announced today that Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi will take part in a WHO-coordinated pilot implementation programme that will make the world’s first malaria vaccine available in selected areas, beginning in 2018.

The injectable vaccine, RTS,S, was developed to protect young children from the most deadly form of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. RTS,S will be assessed in the pilot programme as a complementary malaria control tool that could potentially be added to the core package of WHO-recommended measures for malaria prevention.

“The prospect of a malaria vaccine is great news. Information gathered in the pilot will help us make decisions on the wider use of this vaccine”, said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Combined with existing malaria interventions, such a vaccine would have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives in Africa,” she added.

Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria worldwide. Global efforts in the last 15 years have led to a 62 percent reduction in malaria deaths between 2000 and 2015, yet approximately 429,000 people died of the disease in 2015, the majority of them young children in Africa.

The WHO pilot programme will assess whether the vaccine’s protective effect in children aged 5 – 17 months old during Phase III testing can be replicated in real-life. Specifically, the pilot programme will assess the feasibility of delivering the required four doses of RTS,S, the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths, and its safety in the context of routine use.

WHO recommendations and RTS,S

RTS,S was developed by GSK and is the first malaria vaccine to have successfully completed a Phase III clinical trial. The trial was conducted between 2009 and 2014 through a partnership involving GSK, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and a network of African research sites in seven African countries—including Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.

RTS,S is also the first malaria vaccine to have obtained a positive scientific opinion from a stringent medicines regulatory authority, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which approved RTS,S in July 2015.

In October 2015, two independent WHO advisory groups, comprised of the world’s foremost experts on vaccines and malaria, recommended pilot implementation of RTS,S in three to five settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The recommendation came from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC), following a joint review of all available evidence on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The World Health Organization formally adopted the recommendation in January 2016.

Pilot implementation

The three countries were selected to participate in the pilot based on the following criteria: high coverage of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs); well-functioning malaria and immunisation programmes, a high malaria burden even after scale-up of LLINs, and participation in the Phase III RTS,S malaria vaccine trial. Each of the three countries will decide on the districts and regions to be included in the pilots. High malaria burden areas will be prioritized, as this is where the benefit of the vaccine is predicted to be highest. Information garnered from the pilot will help to inform later decisions about potential wider use of the vaccine.

The malaria vaccine will be administered via intramuscular injection and delivered through the routine national immunization programmes. WHO is working with the three countries to facilitate regulatory authorization of the vaccine for use in the pilots through the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF). Regulatory support will also include measures to enable the appropriate safety monitoring of the vaccine and rigorous evaluation for eventual large scale use.

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNITAID, are partnering to provide US$49.2 million for the first phase of the pilot programme (2017-2020) which will be complemented by in-kind contributions from WHO and GSK.

UNITED NATIONS, Jul 11 2019 (IPS) - The United Nations has warned of drought, disease and war preventing farmers from producing enough food for millions of people across Africa and other regions, leading to the need for major aid operations.

A report called the Crop Prospects and Food Situation by the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that shortages of grain and other foodstuffs have left people in 41 countries — 31 of them in Africa — in need of handouts. Related IPS Articles Food From Thought

Looking to the Land in the Climate Change Race

Desertification ‘More Dangerous and More Insidious than Wars’

“Ongoing conflicts and dry weather conditions remain the primary causes of high levels of severe food insecurity, hampering food availability and access for millions of people,” U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters on Tuesday.

Southern Africa has experienced both dry spells and rainfall damage from Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in Mozambique on Mar. 14. The storm caused “agricultural production shortfalls” and big “increases in cereal import needs,” added Haq.

Farmers in Zimbabwe and Zambia have seen harvests decline this year. Some three million people faced shortages at the start of 2019, but food price spikes there will likely push that number upwards in the coming months, researchers say.

In eastern Africa, crop yields have dropped in Somalia, Kenya and Sudan due to “severe dryness”, added Haq.

According to the FAO, life for rural herders in Kassala State, in eastern Sudan, has been upended by a drought that has forced them to move livestock away from traditional grazing routes in pursuit of greener pastures.

“Life would be so hard if our livestock died. We wouldn’t have food or milk for the children,” Khalda Mohammed Ibrahim, a farmer near Aroma, in Kassala State, told FAO. “When it is dry, I am afraid the animals will starve — and then we will too.”

Droughts are getting worse, says the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). By 2025, some 1.8 billion people will experience serious water shortages, and two thirds of the world will be “water-stressed”.

In Asia, low yields of wheat and barley outputs are raising concerns in North Korea, where dry spells, heatwaves and flooding have led to what has been called the worst harvests the hermit dictatorship has seen in a decade, the report said.

More than 10 million North Koreans — or 40 percent of the country’s population — are short of food or require aid handouts, the U.N.’s Rome-based agency for agriculture said in its 42-page study.

FAO researchers also addressed the spread of a deadly pig disease in China that has disrupted the world’s biggest pork market and is one of the major risks to a well-supplied global agricultural sector.

China is grappling with African swine fever, which has spread across much of the country this past year. There is no cure or vaccine for the disease, often fatal for pigs although harmless for humans.

By the middle of June, more than 1.1 million pigs had died or been culled. The bug has also been reported in Vietnam, Cambodia, Mongolia, North Korea and Laos, affecting millions of pigs and threatening farmers’ livelihoods.

The FAO forecast a five percent fall in Chinese pork output this year, while imports were predicted to rise to almost two million tonnes from an average 1.6 million tonnes per year from 2016 to 2018.

Conflict is another worry, the FAO said. While Syria and Yemen have seen “generally conducive weather conditions for crops”, fighting between government forces, rebels and other groups in both countries has ravaged agriculture.

Violence in Yemen has triggered what the U.N. calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 3.3 million people displaced and 24.1 million — more than two-thirds of the population — in need of aid.

Last month, the U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP) announced a “partial suspension” of aid affecting 850,000 people in Yemen’s capital Sanaa, saying the Houthi rebels that run the city were diverting food from the needy.

Likewise, in Africa, simmering conflicts in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan have caused a “dire food security situation”. In South Sudan, seven million people do not have enough food.",2019-07-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['drought', 'africa', 'war', 'food', 'million', 'shortages', 'disease', 'uns', 'dry', 'seen', 'hit', 'global', 'sudan', 'fao', 'agriculture']",Ghana,news article,English
203,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought Kills Crops but won't Impact Milk Output - Opinion - Daily Mirror,http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Drought-Kills-Crops-but-won-t-Impact-Milk-Output-126472.html,"You may not believe me; I have news about the drought: Good news, better news, best news and the bonus.Did you know that the income from selling milk compensated the farmer’s losses incurred from crop failures during this period? That’s the good news as the farmer with dairy cows received 46.1% higher income this Maha season. The drought had a beneficial effect on milk production, increasing it by 77% during this period. That’s the better news. The cost of production of a litre of milk in the Dry Zone is between Rs.10 to 15 and the sale price is between Rs.65 to 80. Hence, the turnover is between 300 to 700%. Now that is the best news. In addition to these, there is an overall increase of 13.3% income per cow.

Can any agricultural enterprise match this?

Furthermore, consuming milk from Dry zone cattle is ecologically sensible, as these cows are part of an integrated agricultural system that raises crops primarily for human consumption. No dedicated crops were grown for them and their diets are mainly human food crop residue and naturally

growing grasses.

This news implies that Sri Lanka should capitalize in the Livestock sector sub-sector. Why? The effects of climate change and drought can be minimized by crop farmers rearing livestock. This is a fact. Such livestock enterprises can be considered as a facilitator for the sustainable growth of human food of crop origin. Here I am referring to an integrated farming system, which consists of around 95% of the ruminant (cattle, buffalo and goat) population of Sri Lanka. The prevailing drought condition severely affected paddy and highland food cultivation. Farmers usually start land preparation and planting paddy and highland crops from the beginning of September to October and November. It is safe to say that this expenditure is around Rs.40,000 per acre in both paddy and highland cropping and will be recovered after the sale of the harvest at the end of season. It was not to be, this time, as the prevailing drought destroyed their crops. However, farmers with dairy cattle recovered this amount within 21/2 months See table below.

With the advent of the Maha season, farmers are busy with land preparation, followed by crop cultivation and will have less time to attend to livestock activities. In this period, cattle and other ruminants are restricted to prevent any crop damage and easy management. They will not be provided with adequate amounts of food and water, no grazing and sometimes no milking, which will result in the loss of 2 million litres per year. The consequence of this restriction results in a low feed intake- and very little milk is collected during the Maha season when compared to the Yala season. However, due to the drought conditions in the 2016/17 Maha season, this has changed. This season, paddy land and highlands have been mostly abandoned and look bare but there is a luscious growth of grass, remnants of the failed crop and a few wet patches due to intermittent rains. Grazing herds are visible in these abandoned

crop fields.

This situation has allowed the milking herd to consume sufficient herbage to provide nutrients required for their body and milk production. However, unlike in a normal year, these animals were able to maintain a healthy condition and a nutrient reserve throughout the year that may have indirect results such as increased milk production, prolonged lactation period, increasing fat percentage and increase in the number of calves who would initiate milk production. This added income through these direct and indirect benefits will support the total farm activities in this crop-livestock mixed farming system. The following chart 1 shows an increase in milk production by 43.8%, 76.6%, 98.3% and 103.7% in the months of November, December, January and February respectively. This is contrary to what we usually witness in the regular Maha season (from 2007/08 to 2015/16) with normal rainfall.

Poor nutrition in the Maha season can cause severe problems in the cattle population. Indigenous cattle breeds were less affected but crossbreeding with European and Indian breeds showed poor growth, a shorter lactation period and longer calving intervals. A poor body condition is apparent through visible hips and pin bones, the outline of 3 to 5 ribs and the outline of the spine. Some of these features can be observed in the image 1 below.



Yet, after the Maha harvest, an ample amount of feeding will allow these cattle to recover and increase milk production. However, during the 2016/17 Maha season there is a sufficient amount of feed to maintain a favourable body score. This will reflect in increased lactation periods by about 30 days and reduced calving interval by about 2 months. Ruminant milk and meat production is predominantly a grazing farming system. This grazing farming system has failed to produce milk consistently throughout the year and supply milk to meet the demand. This is due to the quality of herbage available for grazing and owing to the lack of feed at critical times. In the past they were allowed to graze in forest and marginal pasture lands, in addition to uncultivated land in the Yala season (dry period) where irrigated water is provided only to cultivate around 30 - 40% land. Later, government regulations were legally enacted to prevent ruminant grazing in forest and marginal pasture land. The effect of this is the drastic reduction of ruminant population during the past two decades. In addition, the new paddy harvesting practice, through heavy machinery prevents the use of rice straw. However, there will be a fresh problem in the Dry Zone farming system with the new irrigation projects being able to provide sufficient irrigated water to cultivate the rest of the land during the Yala season (dry period) for only human food.

This will have a major consequence on the growth of the ruminant population, as this farming system will be completely cut off from the land. Hence, there is a need to transform this grazing milk production system to a stall feeding system in the dry zone. This is not possible unless an intervention to the feeding system is introduced.

Key lessons learned:

Modes of interventions not focused to the real problem for a paradigm shift.

Annual Loss of 2.2 million litres in the Anuradhapura and Trincomalee areas.

Continuation of the practice of grazing management (free grazing) system in Dry Zone.

Demand for replacement stock higher than the current supply.

Seasonality of availability of feed- no measures to increase shelf-life of crop-residue and grass.

Starvation and water deprivation effects physiology of cattle

Difficulties of women-headed families rearing cattle – Unable to take animals for grazing to distant places.

Impact needs to be generated:

Increasing crossbred population through artificial insemination (AI) and organized natural breeding system. Currently, crossbred pregnant heifer costs Rs.120,000. Half the population is of the indigenous types yielding 2 – 3 litres per day. Hence, to do any intervention that will result in a paradigm shift, there is a need to increase the crossbred population that will yield 10 to 15 litres per day.

The AI program has the capacity to supply around 40% of the required replacement and the rest either takes a long time to conceive or breed using a nondescript male unsuited to produce calves that can produce more milk. Milk marketing organizations will benefit from every calving, as it results in the inception of milk production. Hence, it will be advantageous to have a national programme for Natural Breeding managed by Milco through using good quality Jersey males from the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB). They should position one such stud unit per milk collecting centre. A member of this milk collecting centre will be responsible for maintaining this stud centre, where he economically benefits through the compensatation for the use of the stud bull for natural breeding.",2017-03-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['kills', 'impact', 'milk', 'land', 'opinion', 'grazing', 'wont', 'cattle', 'output', 'drought', 'crops', 'maha', 'population', 'period', 'production', 'season', 'system']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
667,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Transforming The Society Through Education - GNAT - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/transforming-the-society-through-education-gnat/,"GNAT is the biggest public sector union in the country, and her mission and visions are collectively achieved through the efforts putten into doing hard work.

In her speech delivered at the Kumasi Metro’s 5th quadrennial Delegates Conference held at the GNAT Hall on 12th April, 2017, the acting national president of GNAT, Mrs. Philippa Lawson said, teaches are wonderful people whose contributions towards national development cannot be over emphasized.

Saying that, the teacher at all times influences the lives of people positively. ” Our job cuts across all facets of life, for the dedication and meritorious services we render in and outside the classroom, I say AYEKOO to all teachers for your tireless efforts in making the country what it is and what it will be in the future.”

According to Mrs. Lawson, the association does not take unilateral decisions. Decision making starts at the grassroot level which is the basic unit through all the levels. And said since the delegates are representing their various districts, they would be able to come out with the best resolutions that will benefit all teachers.

The theme for the conference, “Transforming Society Through Education : The Role Of The Teacher Towards Agenda 2030”, is appropriate. “The world is changing at a very fast pace and therefore, there is the need for us to change our way of doing things and for that matter, teaching. Bearing in mind that, we are the pivot around which transformation and development revolves.

That is why GNAT is an association prioritizing the professional developments of its members. Even though, it’s the duty of the Ghana Education Service to retrain teachers to sharpen our skills, GNAT in collaboration with Canadian Teachers Federation, organises workshops for it’s members in three regions across the country for free. And this year the GNAT/CTF program will be organized in Accra, Central and Western regions.” Mrs. Lawson noted.

Hinting on the role of the teacher towards agenda 2030, she outlined the following;

* There is the need for them to adapt to change and be ready accept new views, methods and techniques, move away from traditional waysof doing things and use scientific methods.

* The teacher should be a facilitator and not a lecturer.

* Should have in depth knowledge on the learners and how fast they are growing in terms of technology.

* Teacher must be curious in acquiring professional knowledge of education framework and curriculum learners, identify gaps in knowledge and go beyond textbooks.

* Exhibit professional attitudes and values, knowing very well that, they are role models for the children and to name a few.

She continued that, their major pressing concerns as teachers, are the issues of validations of their promotions, Tier two pension, Souvenirs and salaries. But their officer have met her for a lengthy discussion and the details will be made known to the national council in order to address all their concerns.

Present at the gathering was the former regional director of education, Mr. J. K Onyinah, to grace the occasion.

1074,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Southern Africa: Drought - 2018-2021 - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/disaster/dr-2018-000429-zwe,"The number of severely food insecure people in Southern Africa rose to an estimated 9.6 million at the start of the lean season (October 2018 to April 2019), due to an increase of 1.1 million people in Malawi. Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique. (OCHA, 26 Nov 2018)

Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid‑December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. (GIEWS, 22 Jan 2019)

Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, a Flash Appeal was launched to galvanize funding for rapid response in the Grand Sud region, where 890,000 people are severely food insecure. (OCHA, 22 Jan 2019)

FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time.

President Hage Geingob [of Namibia] yesterday declared the current drought affecting 23 arid and semi-arid counties and pockets of other areas a national disaster. Since 2013, most parts of Namibia recorded below normal rainfall, thereby leaving the grazing land exhausted and with little recovery. (New Era, 7 May 2019)

An estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food insecure this year. When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year, food insecurity increased by 28%. It is also 7.4% higher than it was during the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2016/17. (SADC, 11 Jul 2019)

The overall food security situation in the region is deteriorating and the number of severely food insecure people is rising in some countries, reaching a peak between October 2019 and March 2020. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes prevail in cyclone affected areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe and areas significantly affected by the drought and the deteriorating macro-economic context in Zimbabwe. Emergency (IPC 4) outcomes prevail in parts of Southern Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini. Poor crop performance due to variable and late rainfall affected significant portions of Lesotho, Eswatini, southern Madagascar, and southern Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, while the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused damage and destruction to harvests in eastern Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, and central and north Mozambique. (ECHO, 4 Sep 2019)

A record 45 million people across the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) will be severely food insecure in the next six months, United Nations food agencies have warned ... There are more than 11 million people now experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4 in nine Southern African countries: Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Eswatini and Lesotho ... The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020. In addition to addressing urgent food and nutrition needs, they will help smallholder farmers boost production and reduce losses, manage precious soil and water resources in a sustainable way and embrace climate-smart agricultural practices, better access to inputs, credit and markets, and spearhead vaccination campaigns to contain livestock disease.

The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a US$3.39 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help meet the immediate food needs of drought-affected people in Zambia. The US support, confirmed in December 2019, comes at a moment of increasing needs, after drought and prolonged dry spells have left 2.3 million people severely food insecure and in need of assistance. Through this funding, WFP will deliver 2,380 MT of pulses to complement the Government’s maize for three months, giving 255,000 drought-affected people across the country the food and nutritional assistance they need.

A record 45 million Southern Africans are food insecure as the region enters the peak of the lean season (January-March 2020) (WFP, 14 Jan 2020)

Between October 2019 and March 2020, an estimated 430,000 people are facing severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3+) and require urgent humanitarian action. (IPC, 23 Jan 2020)

More than 4.34 million people in rural Zimbabwe are acutely food insecure facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse from February-June 2020. That is equivalent to 45% of the country’s rural population. This includes over 1.04 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, with Hwange, Kariba and Binga districts being the most vulnerable. (IPC, 30 Mar 2020)

According to the results of the IPC, around 26% of Lesotho’s population (380,000 people) are facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and above from July to September 2020 and require urgent humanitarian action. This includes around 33,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 350,000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). In the current period, seven districts are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3 ) with the exception of Butha-Buthe, Leribe and Berea, where around 560,000 people are classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and require support to maintain their livelihoods. (IPC, 28 Aug 2020)

Between October 2020 and March 2021, Zambia’s food security situation is expected to deteriorate, as this coincides with the lean season, when more households will rely on the market for food. It is projected that about 1.98 million people (29% of the analysed population) will be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. IPC, 01 Dec 2020)

By the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of Madagascar, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In Mozambique, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province—which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October—and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In Zimbabwe, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021. Without the humanitarian assistance delivered in Zimbabwe in 2020, these figures would be much higher, according to the IPC analysis. OCHA, 19 Jan 2021)

According to the acute food insecurity analysis update in Zambia for the February-March 2021 projection period, an estimated 1.73 million people (25% of the analysed population) are likely to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes around 1.5 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and around 240,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), who will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods. IPC, 12 Mar 2021)

Around 27.3 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), making the central African country the host of the highest number of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in the world. IPC, 30 Mar 2021)

Angola has been experiencing episodes of drought since December last year with below average rainfall in the provinces of Cuanza Sul, Benguela, Huambo, Namibe and Huíla. The situation is not expected to improve in the coming months in the absence of above average rainfall. Since the beginning of March 2021, Angolans living in the border provinces of Cunene and Huila are crossing into Namibia at illegal entry points in Omusati and Ohangwena regions in search of food, water, medical services and employment opportunities. The regional councils (local authorities) have recorded altogether 894 people in Omusati and Kunene regions who have crossed into Namibia in search of food.

1874,FL-2021-000038-KEN,109-year-old Dottie Ball dies - Uckfield News,https://uckfieldnews.com/109-year-old-dottie-ball-dies/,"A service of celebration and thanksgiving is due to be held on Thursday for the life of 109-year-old Dorothy Ball. She was recently listed as the 21st oldest person in the UK.

Dottie, as she was known, was born on October 5, 1911, in London, but her family later moved to Yorkshire where she met her husband John.

After the end of World War 2 the couple went to East Africa as missionaries, spending ten years in Tanzania and 16 years in Kenya. They spent their retirement years in Seaford.

Home-maker

Daughter Glenys Dean said that her mother was a home-maker, loved having visitors, was a needlewoman, wonderful cook and gardener. She had many stories to tell about life in Africa.

Dottie was 106 when she went into Temple Grove care home at Herons Ghyll, near Uckfield.

Glenys said: “She received care second to none from wonderful nurses/carers. We could not have chosen a better place for her to spend the last years of her very long life.”

Dottie was totally unaware of the pandemic and she was able to receive occasional visits from her family outside periods of lockdown.

Cards from the Queen

Glenys was with her as she celebrated her 109th birthday when she received her sixth card from the Queen. Dottie had received them previously when she was 100, 105, 106, 107 and 108.

Glenys said that she and her brother Stephen grew up in Africa. She remembered the excitement of food being delivered in boxes once a month.

There was no running water, no electricity – and there was always the possibility of arriving home to find a leopard sitting on the veranda.

Trips to the outside loo were terrifying because you never knew whether a snake was going to drop in.

‘Mrs Practical’

Glenys said Dottie was ‘Mrs Practical’. She needed to be resourceful because John spent a lot of time away travelling. She made the children’s clothes while John made some of their toys.

“We didn’t think anything of it then, of course,” said Glenys. “That was just what life was like, but I do remember when we came home Stephen was amazed to turn a light on at the flick of a switch.”

One of the things John did while in Kenya was set up a training college for the Church Army. It is now called Carlile College and, from very small beginnings has grown exponentially over the years.

Dottie died peacefully at Temple Grove on March 31, and a service of celebration and thanksgiving for her life is to be held on Thursday, April 22, at All Saints Church, Crowborough.

300,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Germany's first female Euro commentator faces sexist outrage online - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-first-female-euro-commentator-faces-sexist-outrage-online/a-19340658,"Social media users flooded German public broadcaster ZDF's sites after Friday's Italy-Sweden match, not to voice complaints about the game, but to bemoan the broadcaster's female commentator.

Claudia Neumann, a reporter for German public broadcaster ZDF, became the first female play-by-play announcer for this year's men's European Championships in France.

But her role as the match's main commentator enraged numerous soccer fans. Many of whom posted complaints about her ""annoying voice"" while others said women have no place doing sports commentary for men's soccer. One Twitter user wrote: ""Women shouldn't commentate men's soccer. It doesn't fit. Annoying. Period.""

Her Euro 2016 debut was the June 11 match between Wales and Slovakia. Following that first game, users insulted and attacked her with misogynistic slogans about ""the place of women"" and even rape threats.

ZDF 'shocked' by sexist comments

Despite expecting some criticism following the games, the head of ZDF's sports department said he couldn't believe the ""harsh formulation"" of comments that appeared on ZDF social media sites.

""I'm shocked,"" said Dieter Gruschwitz on Saturday to sports news agency SID, calling some of the social media comments ""asocial critique.""

In a post on the broadcaster's Facebook site, ZDF editors said numerous ""offensive"" comments had been deleted.

""If you cannot objectively take part in the discussion, we will block you,"" warned ZDF on Facebook, adding that ""insults are not opinions and will not be tolerated according to our netiquette.""

Stefan Leifert, a ZDF correspondent in Brussels tweeted a screenshot of some of the Facebook comments which included homophobic and sexually explicit remarks.

Neumann: 'I've got thick skin'

The strength of some of the comments prompted an angry reaction from ZDF on Saturday, but a cool reaction from Neumann, herself.

""Hey, people, it's only about football!"" Neumann told SID in an interview, adding that the social media backlash against her ""is all absolutely ridiculous.""

""Most of those people weren't even born when I was already sinking bicycle kicks.""

In 2011, she became the first female sports announcer on German TV for the women's World Cup - women's soccer, as well as men's, had until that point been dominated by male commentators.

When asked how she is coping with the deluge of online criticism following her first two Euro 2016 games, she said she hopes her work will make it easier for more women to break into the ranks of sports commentary.

""If it helps to eventually make it easier for a few younger female colleagues - okay. I can take it,"" Neumann said. ""I've got thick skin.

""I won't let them break my passion and my profession,"" she added.

Fans stand up for Neumann

Many on Twitter and Facebook also praised Neumann's performance during the two Euro matches, including several members of the German media.

One user tweeted that the Italy-Sweden game had ""two good things. 1. The refreshing commentary from Claudia Neumann. 2. The goal from Italy's team.""

Kathrin Steinbichler, an editor for the German newspaper ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" tweeted: ""By the way, Claudia Neumann is one of the best and most knowledgeable colleagues. (She's) doing a super job at the Euro 2016.""

Another twitter user praised Neumann's voice and called her a ""hero.""

Although Neumann was only slated to make the commentary for the tournament's group rounds, some on social media are campaigning for her to take over the Euro 2016 match final.

The ability to provide commentary during an important soccer game ""is not a question of sex, but a question of competence,"" read an online petition calling for her to commentate on more matches.",2016-06-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['faces', 'neumann', 'comments', 'social', 'online', 'female', 'german', 'commentator', 'mens', 'germanys', 'outrage', 'sexist', 'zdf', 'women', 'soccer', 'euro', 'media']",India,news article,English
404,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghanistan: Drought - Information Bulletin n° 1 - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-drought-information-bulletin-n-1,"This bulletin is being issued for information only, and reflects the current situation and details available at this time. The Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) is coordinating closely with Afghanistan authorities, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), other Movement partners with incountry presence, and humanitarian actors regarding potential humanitarian intervention. As of now, no external assistance is determined yet.

The situation

After decades of conflict, the current intensification of fighting and growing insecurity are hampering the Afghan population to have access to humanitarian aid and essential services. In the current unstable and volatile context, the civilian population is paying the highest toll of the protracted conflict in Afghanistan. On top of the conflict related humanitarian needs, below average precipitation and above average temperatures since October 2017 have resulted in significant reductions in snow depths, river flows, water level in dams, water tables and soil moistures. These conditions have negatively and irreversibly impacted the winter of 2017-2018 agricultural season and are expected to also negatively impact the spring and summer of 2018 agricultural season in Afghanistan.

Cumulative precipitation for the season through February 2018 was well below average in most areas, with record low snow accumulation in some basins. Moderate (50-100 mm) to locally heavy (200-300 mm) precipitation occurred over central, north-western, and eastern parts of the country during the months of March and April. However, cumulative seasonal precipitation deficits remain significant in most areas, especially in the north and southwestern parts of the country. Despite increased precipitation in March and April, initial estimates from field reports indicate that area planted for rainfed wheat is smaller than last year, reflecting dry soil conditions and the use of extended areas for grazing.

The overall combined effect is a significant shortage of water for rain-fed agriculture, irrigated agriculture, and pasturage. Based on satellite imagery and data analyses by Information Management and Mine Action Programs (IMMAP) and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET), combined with observations by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP), this shortage could affect up to 2 million rural population in 20 provinces who are reliant on agriculture, livestock, or agriculture-related wage labor for their food security and livelihood.

Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could further impact agricultural production.

Livestock products are major source of nutritious food and income for vulnerable farmers especially women headed households. As it is difficult for people to maintain livestock in absence of fodder and water, livestock production has gone down and livestock sale prices have decreased on average between 20-30 per cent since October 2017. Concurrently, agricultural labour opportunities have declined, and combined with increasing migration of rural workers, have resulted in reduced casual labour wages throughout the country. Limited or no harvest and reduced livestock production can lead to food insecurity and reduced income for those households that are reliant on agriculture. Monitoring of the situation should start immediately and continued during winter 2018 to avoid asset depletion migration and malnutrition.

The latest figure published on 1 May from Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) shows that around 1.9 million people in 20 provinces (Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Samangan, Daykundi, Saripul, Badakshan, Baghlan, Kunduz, Takhar, Nuristan Badghis, Farah, Ghor, Herat, Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan and Zabul) are affected by the prevailing drought conditions. The map of the 20 affected areas is as shown in Figure 1.

Badghis, Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Hilmand, Nimroz, Uruzgan, Kubduz, Takhar, Herat, Ghor and Farah are among the worst affected provinces. The population in these dry spells affected provinces, which are most ikely to need support in the areas of nutrition and food security, water and sanitation, emergency shelter and non-food items.

The Government of Afghanistan requested the international community’s support in mid-April 2018. A technical committee composed of the Ministry of Relief & Rural Development (MRRD), Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL), the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG), ARCS, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA), Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC), WASH, and nutrition clusters has been established to develop a detailed response plan. According to MAIL available data and field observations, lifesaving and agriculture livestock protection needs are massive across the country. The government launched a USD 100 million appeal in mid-April through MAIL for immediate livestock protection for an initial two months of assistance for fodder/feed support and an overall demand of USD 550 million for a 10 months fodder / feed support throughout the 34 provinces of Afghanistan.",2018-05-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['bulletin', 'food', 'water', 'livestock', 'precipitation', 'support', 'information', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'provinces', 'humanitarian', 'n', 'agriculture', 'average', 'areas']",Afghanistan,news article,English

757,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Climate adaptation: setting the stage for transformation | United Nations Development Programme - UNDP,https://www.undp.org/blogs/climate-adaptation-setting-stage-transformation,"In early August, the World Meteorological Organisation confirmed that July 2019 at least equalled, if not surpassed, the hottest month in recorded history. It followed hard on the heels of the hottest June ever recorded, when heatwaves in Europe reportedly caused 13 deaths.

While this headline perhaps startled some readers, providing clear and brutal evidence on the status of our warming planet, for many who have been dealing with the impacts of climate change for decades, it was no surprise. Chennai in southern India with a population of over nine million is in the midst of city-wide water shortages, after months of poor rain and average temperatures stretching well into the 30Cs.

The world is trying to deal with a dawning reality: after decades of learning about the causes of climate change, we are far from where we need to be to effectively tackle it. But there is room for hope. In the past few months both the United Kingdom and the European Union have pledged to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. The upcoming UN Climate Action Summit in New York City in September and this year’s UN climate talks, the COP25, in Santiago, Chile in December are opportunities for all countries to step up their commitments to the Paris Agreement. There are two ways to do this—through the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are the promises each country makes as part of the agreement—and through National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), which integrate climate change risks into all plans and budgets. These two mechanisms are intertwined, because an NAP will contribute to a country's NDC.

Since 2010, when the the process to formulate and implement NAPs was established under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNDP has been working with developing countries to integrate climate changes risks into development plans. The goal is to ensure that ministries are able to assess the medium and long-term risks of climate change in every decision they make, and, critically, that ministerial budgets take the costs into account. This can range from the costs of adaption strategies, such as research and development and dissemination of drought-resilient crops, or it can be the anticipated costs of detrimental climate-related events, such as floods, or decreases in agricultural yields.

With other UN agencies, UNDP has worked with donors such as the Government of Germany and the Global Environmental Facility in more than 70 countries to understand the NAP process and take stock of their climate change adaptation progress. Priorities have been identified and resources mobilized to address these needs. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), a recently-established source of large-scale climate finance, is allocating up to US$3 million for countries to increase adaptation planning. Thirty of these countries have accessed US$79 million from the GCF, 14 of these with UNDP support.

Finance is a primary concern for all countries. Who is going to pay? It is estimated that 85 to 90 percent of the Paris Agreement goals need to be funded by the private sector, this includes adaptation, which has typically less attractive investment opportunities than mitigation. But the tide on this perception is turning.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cote d’Ivoire, UNDP will help facilitate NAPs that identify opportunities that appeal to the private sector, in particular to address the hesitation of investing in climate change adaptation. This will start with a review of different financial instruments that can create more business-friendly environments. With projects like this, that successfully engage private enterprises, word will spread, more people will get involved, and the mechanisms will be refined and enhanced as activities expand.

In Bhutan, climate change is shifting the country’s monsoon, and rain and water supplies are becoming increasingly unpredictable. UNDP is supporting a NAP process focused on addressing climate risks in the water sector. This project will help make the water pathways resilient to climate change, but it will also act as pilot, to develop and refine methods of assessing the risks faced by certain sectors and infrastructure networks, so that the approach can be applied in other cities and industries.

In light of the latest IPCC report which revealed 23 percent of global emissions between 2007 and 2016 came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use, the need to manage land and resources efficiently and to climate-proof our approaches is paramount. In Armenia the NAP will have a strong focus on agriculture and forestry, and part of the GCF funds are being handled by the Ministry of Nature Protection. The NAP will enable the ministry to train civil servants to better assess and address climate change risks and conduct economic cost analyses.

Adaptation is often the main climate change priority for developing countries. The NAPs are a key piece of this puzzle as we strive to reach the Paris Agreement goals. As we look ahead to the Climate Summit and to COP25, the world will be watching their leaders, to see whether their promises can aggregate to enough action to reverse the dangerous path we are on. Meanwhile, we can take some comfort from knowing that efforts to mainstream climate change risks and adaptation into national plans is happening more effectively, more quickly, and at a larger scale.",2019-08-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['risks', 'nap', 'naps', 'change', 'undp', 'water', 'stage', 'climate', 'transformation', 'countries', 'plans', 'adaptation', 'setting']",Ghana,news article,English

Kerala Closes Dam Gates to Save Elephant Trapped By Flood Waters! - The Better India,https://www.thebetterindia.com/155953/kerala-closes-dam-gates-saves-elephant-trapped-floods-news/,"The scenic Athirappilly Falls in Thrissur is a favoured location for filmmakers, and movies like Raavan and Baahubali have been shot here.

However, as Kerala continues to reel under the devastating floods, a very different kind of scene would have played out, had it not been for the locals, forest officials and wildlife lovers.

On Monday, locals discovered a stranded wild elephant who had presumably been swept away from a different location. The pachyderm had somehow managed to climb on a rocky terrain but was unable to move out as it was engulfed by gushing water from all sides.

They alerted the authorities and thus began a 4-hour effort to save the elephant.

Speaking to Hindustan Times, a senior forest official said, “The elephant was tired, and it seems it was stranded there for more than 24 hours. We found gushing water should be controlled to save it. We immediately approached the officials of Peringalkooth dam, and they agreed to shut three sluice gates for two hours.”

The officer elaborated that once the water receded, crackers were burst to lead the tusker into the forest.

With the onset of the winter season, people in need have become more vulnerable

The joint winterisation strategy for 2019-2020 integrates shelter, food, health and WASH

How the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund is helping

Case study: the perils of the winter season

Providing support for winter to affected people

Humanitarian context

Conflict and insecurity, recurrent natural disasters continue to force people to be on the move in in Afghanistan. In the first ten months of the year, over 400,000 people fled their homes due to conflict, with a total of 32 out of 34 provinces affected.

In addition, nearly 300,000 people were affected by natural disasters in 32 out of 34 provinces resulting in at least 149 people killed and 165 injured; and over 39,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. With the onset of the winter season, people in need have become more vulnerable compounding the effects of displacement as many people have exhausted their coping mechanisms as decades of war have eroded people’s resilience. The combination of conflict with repeated displacement, poverty, and the wide-ranging consequences of under-investment in services has resulted in many families to be burdened by burgeoning debt. For example, it is estimated that it will take 16 years for returnees in Badghis to repay the debts they incurred while displaced during the drought

Furthermore, about half a million people from Afghanistan returned from Pakistan, Iran and other countries in 2019. As in previous years, many returnees are returning with minimal assets and are in need of humanitarian assistance upon arrival as well as income-earning opportunities. Without assistance, people have little capacity to cope and recover. Next year, humanitarian needs are expected to increase with almost a quarter of the population or 9.4 million people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance; 56 per cent of people in need are children.

438,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghans fleeing conflict face worsening hunger | NRC - Norwegian Refugee Council,https://www.nrc.no/news/2018/june/afghans-fleeing-conflict-face-worsening-hunger/,"“We are concerned that the poorest cohort of Afghan society, particularly those already displaced by conflict, will be worst affected. Displaced people affected by the drought are prevented from reaching markets and aid due to the ongoing armed conflict, said Christopher Nyamandi, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) country director in Afghanistan.

Over two million people in Afghanistan are expected to become severely food insecure in the coming months and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in order to survive, according to the United Nations. The North and West regions are estimated to be particularly at risk due to lack of snow and rainfall leading to dried up water points.

“Rivers and water points started drying up and we couldn’t find any grass. Last month we had to sell all our sheep and goats for 80 to 90 per cent less than what they are worth, and we fled to Qala-i-naw. Those with more money to pay went to Herat, but we couldn’t afford the travel so we stayed in Badghis. Even here, we don’t have water to drink or food to eat. The weather is hot and there is no roof over our heads. Our children are suffering under the sunlight and there is no one to help us,” displaced Abdul Salaam Babi, 35, told NRC staff. He is originally from Muqur district in Badghis province.

In a surveyconducted by NRC in January, one in two displaced Afghans said they could not adequately feed their families, and were often skipping meals. This is an increase from one in three in 2012. Regional differences are stark – with one in four respondents in conflict-affected Kandahar and Nangahar provinces saying they had suffered hunger over the past year, compared with one in six in Kabul.

In hard-to-reach Badghis Province in the northwest of the country, the most food insecure province in the country, NRC is currently assisting Afghans fleeing from fighting in Qadis District to the provincial centre. Over half of the displaced had no food stocks, and the rest had less food than to last them for a full week. 86 per cent of these displaced households had below borderline food consumption scores, with three quarters borrowing food, two thirds going into mounting debts, and a third eating smaller portions and fewer meals. One in four had restricted their own eating so that small children could eat. Prices of basic staples of wheat flour and rice have begun to climb by about 20 per cent, according to a new assessment conducted over the last weeks by NRC.

“The humanitarian crisis is not only a consequence of the severe drought, it is also a sad result of man-made factors. An under-developed irrigation system and the weakening economy is hitting ordinary families hard. But it is the ongoing and worsening conflict that is compounding these factors and bearing such a heavy cost on civilians,” said Nyamandi. “There must be an increased level of humanitarian funding and the international community must sustain the support to ensure the needs of vulnerable Afghans continue to be met”.

More than one million Afghans have been newly displaced by conflict in the past two years alone – a threefold increase in less than five years.",2018-06-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'food', 'water', 'badghis', 'hunger', 'nrc', 'conflict', 'face', 'fleeing', 'humanitarian', 'cent', 'country', 'worsening']",Afghanistan,news article,English
1021,Drought Sri Lanka,"ASPCA Provides $250000 for Hay in Equine ""Bale-Out"" – The Horse - TheHorse.com",https://thehorse.com/118691/aspca-provides-250000-for-hay-in-equine-bale-out/,"The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) Nov. 19 announced that a total of $250,000 is being granted to 53 equine welfare organizations and animal control agencies across 19 states as part of its Equine ‘Hay Bale-Out’ grant program. The funds will provide relief for horses impacted by the high cost and low supply of hay in these drought-stricken states.

Soaring temperatures, widespread drought, wildfires, and export to Asian markets have depleted the supply of hay, creating a desperate need among equine caretakers. The cost of hay has been driven upward at an alarming rate, as the supply and quality of hay dwindles, with bales of hay costing up to $25 in some regions.

""The ASPCA knows of the devastating hardships that the equine community is facing this year due to the immense shortages and skyrocketing costs of hay,"" said Jacques Schultz, senior director of the ASPCA Equine Fund. ""Our Hay Bale-Out program provides the dedicated equine caretakers with the funds needed to properly care for their animals, and we are thankful that we are able to assist those who are struggling to feed their horses and donkeys.""

Diane Zook, president of the Beartooth Humane Alliance of Montana, one of the groups receiving a grant through the ASPCA’s Hay Bale-Out program, added, ""This past season has seen hay production merely a third of normal production due to persevering drought conditions. We predict the low inventory and high costs of hay will make this an exceptionally challenging winter for families already struggling to feed their horses.

2191,FL-2017-000155-VNM,How a green pillow is helping to save Hoi An from climate change floods - Sydney Morning Herald,https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/how-a-green-pillow-is-helping-to-save-hoi-an-from-climate-change-floods-20210427-p57mqe.html,"Save Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later. Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size For decades, monsoon floods have been eroding the riverbank of Triem Tay, an island village just a bridge crossing away from the ancient town of Hoi An. As his village shrank, Pham Duoc destroyed his old house to move further inland. Now at the age of 54, the former carpenter hopes the current and third house will be his last. I wasnt sad, Duoc said of the decision to abandon his second house of 30 years in 2018 after 2017s historic flooding carried away 12 hectares of Triem Tays land. Thats what I had to do. He was also worried that a green embankment he had helped build wouldnt be stable enough to withstand future flooding. He wasnt wrong. After eight consecutive floods triggered by fierce storms that hit central Vietnam in late 2020, two-thirds of the sonneratia mangrove forest they planted along the 650-metre-long west bank of the island disappeared. But the silver lining was that the land remained nearly intact. Sonneratia are front-line plants and their death is like a sacrifice to protect the flora behind them, landscape architect Dr Dao Ngo says. They form the first layer of what she calls a soft levee girding the riverbank. She doesnt view the loss of the mangroves as a failure but an inevitable course of nature. The green embankment is meant to embrace forces of nature rather than resist them and youve got to accept there are gains and losses to be made. Daos mangrove plantations, which she helped fund along with the city of Hoi An, are nothing like the concrete embankments commonly used throughout Vietnam and worldwide as shields against surging waters. Instead of confronting forces of nature, the green levees adapt, aiming to restore the natural riverbank ecosystem. Nguyen Thi Vui in her boat in the flooded streets of Hoi An, Vietnam, in November 2017. Credit:AP Triem Tay lies in the estuary of Thu Bon river, a very sensitive and fragile area where hard solutions [to erosion] wont work, said Dao, who has studied the regions ecology for nearly two decadesas an urban planning consultant. Here, dunes and islands rise and fall as water flows fluctuate between wet and dry seasons. Sixty years ago, Triem Tay was more than twice its current size.

The common thinking among us humans is: we never want to lose land, Dao says. Between land and water, there always exists an ecosystem. If you put a barrier over it, it breaks down. As storms grow stronger and more unpredictable as the climate changes, the force that hits concrete embankments increases. In Daos words, by fighting strength with strength, the destruction is going to be enormous. The mangrove forest planted along Triem Tays riverbank is like a pillow that doesnt stop but slows down the forces of nature. Dr Daos green embankment plan. Behind the first layer of deep-rooted sonneratia mangroves are fast-growing local grasses  a second layer that grows on a sloping bank designed to let the waves through while reducing their destructive force. They are then followed by the final layer of tall pine trees, which act as a natural windbreaker. The three layers are supported by a system of bamboo logs designed to help retain the soil when the trees are still young. The villagers are also philosophical about floods. In Triem Tay, people arent afraid of flooding, says Nguyen Yen, a village elder. We have learnt to live with the floods, he said, seated in the parlour of his house, a traditional one-storey building with an attic for storage during the monsoon season. Outside in his garden stands a boat, which replaces bikes for transport during flooding. Nguyen Yen was born and raised in Triem Tay village, and has lived through the many floods it has endured. Whenever the floods came, we stayed in the garret and ate instant noodles to survive, he said. Credit:Yen Duong Thirty years ago, Yens fellow villagers planted a bamboo forest by the islands west bank to slow the waves and winds. Today, it is the unofficial fourth layer of the green embankment on a farm purchased by Dao as a way for an outsider to earn locals trust as she continues to test and refine her work.

But the future is bleak for the World Heritage-listed city of Hoi An, especially its beloved ancient port town where centuries-old yellow wooden shophouses line the Thu Bon river. No more than two metres above sea level, the city is flood-prone and vulnerable to rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016, a joint report by UNESCO, UNEP and the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that climate change would make conditions even worse from 2020. Every monsoon season, local news outlets run pictures of the ancient town submerged in water. Millions of dollars have been spent on concrete embankments to save the citys famous Cua Dai beach, to little effect. The causes arent simply climate change. Rapid development in the area, including the tourism boom that followed Hoi Ans recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, has also caused problems. Dozens of hydropower dams upstream have changed the water flow and the amount of sediment brought downstream, while illegal sand mining, resort construction and a shift to intensive agriculture have all weakened the ground. Dr Dao Ngo bought her own land in Triem Tay village to do her conservation work. Credit:Yen Duong Now the ecological component is extremely important. In the past it was culture, now its ecology, Hoi Ans vice-chairman Nguyen The Hung said of the local governments development strategy. The city has earned its place on the global tourism map, welcoming 4 million foreign visitors in 2019, compared with just 1 million in 2015, by betting on its cultural capital and ecotourism. The shift to environmental projects, says Hung, is about encouraging a green mindset in everyday life and business. The city is piloting a weekend organic market, recycling restaurant waste and reducing reliance on single-use plastic. Of course, it is difficult and it will take time, says Hung. Perhaps we wont succeed in this period but it will start changing with the young generation. As the city prepares to revise its long-term strategy in the pandemics wake, Hung doesnt want to go back to being dependent on the tourists who once contributed 70 per cent of the citys revenue. Weve got to try to preserve the maximum amount of agricultural land, like the rice fields that dot the urban landscape of Hoi An. As dozens of per cent of residents have farmland, therell be less to worry about.

Ecology-based development, in Hungs words, also means preserving the citys forests, like the nypa palm mangroves in Cam Thanh commune at the mouth of the Thu Bon river. They currently make up the buffer zone of the Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve but Hung wants this better protected. If we achieve that, well be able to keep the water coconut forest, preserve the ecosystem and locals life will definitely be improved. Loading The mangrove forest is more than 200 years old but not native to Hoi An. Locals say their great-grandparents brought the trees from the Mekong Delta after noticing their ability to stabilise the soil. Over time, what started as a couple of trees planted outside houses by the river has grown into a vast forest that spans 120 hectares. You dont see erosion here, but build-up [of land], said Diep Van Nam, a 45-year-old construction worker and farmer who has been planting nypa palms for 10 years. During the 2020 historic storms, the nypa palms in Cam Thanh survived three days under water. Ive never seen these trees die because of flooding, said Nam, adding that they could withstand a week-long deluge. During the Vietnam-American War, North Vietnamese soldiers and locals hid in the nypa forest from enemy forces. Today, they are the first line of defence against storms for those living on the banks of the river. It is their root system, which Nam compares to intertwined tyres that go up to 1.5 meters deep into the ground, that keeps them standing tall and the muddy soil firmly in place. The palms grow so fast that every year, to prevent the forest from blocking the rivers mouth, locals prune their trunks and leaves. Before the arrival of bricks and concrete, houses in Cam Thanh were built of palm leaves. Now, they mainly serve as material to thatch roofs for cafes, restaurants and tourism accommodation.

Le Thi Huongs family is one of the few who to this day live in a house built entirely from nypa leaves, nestled behind a row of the palms she planted more than 20 years ago to keep her safe from storms. To people living in poverty, the nypa palms are a literal lifeline, which is why 20 years ago Huong invested what she described as a fortune on seeds to plant a nypa forest behind her house on the banks of Thu Bon river. Le Thi Huong, 59, a mangrove palm farmer, in her home made from the palms in Cam Thanh commune. Credit:Yen Duong Before the pandemic, she was among the hundreds of locals who made a living by taking tourists in a bamboo basket boat, which fits no more than three people, through the canals. But since early 2020, the 59-year-old woman, her sick husband and three children have all been out of work and rely on whatever nature has to offer, from fish and seafood caught in the sea to the nypa fruits, which can be made into a sweet soup. The livelihood of locals [of Cam Thanh] is strongly tied to the ecosystem of nypa palms; thats why they protect it, Hung explained. Nypa palms were among the first trees Dao planted alongside the banks of Triem Tay in 2015. But their heavy trunks could not withstand the stronger currents around Triem Tays sandy soil. In 2017, Dao started experimenting with sonneratia brought in from Quang Tri province further north. By the end of the year floods wiped out the seedlings, but the second and third layers of the soft embankment survived. After this deluge, the city of Hoi An approved the extension of the green embankment in Triem Tay to cover the neighbouring Cam Kim commune. Local authorities have also advised several tourism projects to switch to soft embankments instead of their planned concrete ones. But authorities remain cautious about Hoi Ans toughest erosion sites, such as Cua Dai beach, preferring to invest millions of dollars in high-tech concrete embankments.

The home-buying season is in full swing in North America — and flood season is still on.

After overflowing rivers ravaged communities in Newfoundland and British Columbia, the Town of Banff, Alta., received its own flood alert on Tuesday. And flash flooding turned the streets of Maryland’s historic Ellicott City into rapids on Sunday.

So how can homebuyers reduce the risk that the biggest investment of their lives will at some point end up under water?

You wouldn’t necessarily know it from the headlines. With extreme weather events now happening with alarming frequency, flooding is becoming increasingly common, even for homes that are nowhere close to waterways. And a basement flooded by sewer backup after a torrential downpour wouldn’t make the news.

READ MORE: Flooding, flooding everywhere – do Canadians have insurance for it?

Flooding has overtaken fire as the No. 1 cause of home insurance payouts, with claims for flooded basements averaging $43,000 in major cities. And yet, there isn’t much in Canada that would help homebuyers assess that risk, says Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

Home inspectors aren’t trained to spot flood risks

A home inspection, for example, will likely tell you little about whether you should waterproof the basement or regrade the perimeter of your future home so that the water flows away from the foundations.

“Home inspectors receive virtually zero training on flood risk assessment,” Feltmate told Global News.

And the process of changing that is just getting underway. Feltmate’s own Intact Centre is developing a flood-risk crash course for home inspectors that will be rolled out in Ontario this September and throughout Canada at the beginning of next year.

Municipal flood plain maps are usually outdated

Large municipalities and conservation authorities across Canada generally have maps that prospective homebuyers can ask to see to check whether a property lies in a known floodplain.

But those drawings are often 25 to 30 years old and woefully out of date, Feltmate said.

The Trudeau government just released guidelines to harmonize flood maps across Canada last year.

Homesellers don’t necessarily have to tell you about past flooding

Don’t think your homeseller will let you know about past floods. Often, the onus of finding that out lies squarely with the homebuyer.

Story continues below advertisement

Editor’s note: The following sentence has been modified to reflect the fact that homesellers have an obligation to disclose latent defects.

In general, homesellers have an obligation to disclose so-called latent defects, including those that “wouldn’t be readily identifiable by a reasonable person doing an inspection of the property,” said Michael Abrams, an Ottawa-based lawyer at Kelly Santini.

“If [a home] floods every spring and [homebuyers] are looking at the property in July, it might not be readily apparent that there is a flooding issue. But if the seller is aware of it and it happens on a regular basis, then that’s something they’d have an obligation to disclose,” Abrams said.

And homesellers can’t lie if you ask them direct questions, he added.

“There’s a duty of good faith that exists that you have to provide complete and truthful answers to those questions.”

READ MORE: Here’s how much climate change can cost homeowners in damages

But homeowners don’t have to volunteer information about properties that are located in a known floodplain or an instance of flooding, whether it was from overland water seeping in through doors and windows or old city regurgitating sewage into the basement.

Story continues below advertisement

Those, at least, are the common-law principles that apply throughout Canada, Abrams said. Each province has its own regulations on the matter, and private law in Quebec is governed by French-inspired civil law.

What homebuyers can do

Canada is catching up when it comes to flood insurance, with a growing number of insurers now providing both sewer-backup and overland insurance, which are generally treated as additional coverage.

But buying flood insurance is no substitute for doing your due diligence before signing on the dotted line. A growing number of homes throughout Canada are becoming uninsurable due to repeated instances of flooding, Feltmate said. And even a single instance of water seeping through your basement drains could lead to drastically higher insurance premiums or denial of further coverage, as Global News has previously reported.

Your best bet? Asking pointed questions of homesellers and their neighbours.

“Spend time in the community,” Feltmate said. The extra legwork could really pay off in the long term.

Catholics in Sri Lanka have expressed concern about their ability to hold regular services during Holy Week due to the scorching weather, lack of rain and the continued threat of government-imposed power cuts.

Mary Patricia, a laywoman who volunteers with the Legion of Mary in capital Colombo, said Catholics in many parishes were planning a three-hour outdoor Way of the Cross pilgrimage around Easter but added this may now have to be called off.

""All of these power cuts, combined with the sweltering weather, could affect services scheduled for Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday,"" she said, explaining that the services from April 18-20 were due to include outdoor activities.

With the mercury hitting 38 degrees Celsius this month, the sweltering heat is potentially dangerous, especially for young children and the elderly.

The punishing heat and lack of rainfall have caused reservoirs, rivers and water tanks to dry up at an alarming pace as another drought ravages Sri Lanka's potable and other water supplies, threatening crops, livestock and people's livelihoods.

""Many reservoirs and rivers have emptied due to the lack of monsoon rains this year,"" said Naveen Kosgoda, a farmer activist from Anuradhapura in North Central Province.

""The country is suffering from chronic water shortages. Power cuts at day and night are making matters worse because they disturb the production schedules of small businessmen.""

The government has been imposing daily power cuts as an urgent measure since the dried-up waterways have put a dent in the amount of hydropower available.

However, officials proudly announced in recent days that there had been no such outages during the Sinhala Tamil New Year, celebrated by Buddhists and Hindus from April 13-14.

According to the Disaster Management Center, the dry weather has affected over 580,000 people nationwide.

This prompted the Department of Meteorology to issue an advisory urging manual laborers to seek shade and take regular breaks.

The Ministry of Health has also released a set of guidelines, including a reminder that children should not be allowed to play outside in the midday heat nor left waiting in vehicles when it is baking hot outside.

Chandana Jayaratne, a professor of physical science at Colombo University, said Sri Lanka was experiencing its warmest weather in 140 years, partly as a result of global warming.

Meanwhile, Power and Energy Minister Ravi Karunanayake pledged to thwart future power outages by issuing more licenses for solar farms to diversify the country's energy supplies and rely less on hydropower.",2019-04-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['weather', 'cuts', 'mother', 'week', 'attack', 'daily', 'heat', 'lanka', 'sri', 'holy', 'water', 'sweltering', 'lack', 'nature', 'power', 'services']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
1043,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,"2018-2019 Mozambique Humanitarian Response Plan Revised following Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, May 2019 (November 2018 - June 2019) - Mozambique - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/2018-2019-mozambique-humanitarian-response-plan-revised-following-cyclones-idai,"OVERVIEW OF THE CRISIS

In March and April 2019, Mozambique was hit by two consecutive tropical cyclones that left a trail of death, damage and destruction in their paths. In March, the Tropical Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port City of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow and leaving people stranded on trees and houses. On 25 April, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in Cabo Delgado province, flattening entire villages. Overall, it is estimated that close to 2.2 million need urgent assistance following the cyclones and floods (374,000 people from Cyclone Kenneth and 1.85 million people from Cyclone Idai), on top of 815,000 people already in need as a result of the drought.

The Tropical Cyclone Kenneth and Idai weather systems brought destruction and damage to Cabo Delgado, Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Tete provinces, killing at least 648 people (45 deaths due to Cyclone Kenneth and at least 603 deaths due to Cyclone Idai), injuring nearly 1,700 and leaving an estimated 2.2 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection. Although the death tolls are yet to be disaggregated, women are more likely to die in natural disasters than men. The Cyclone Idai weather system’s impact came in three waves: in early March, the low pressure system caused flooding in Zambezia and Tete in early March, displacing more than 140,000 people; on 14 March, Cyclone Idai made landfall near the port city of Beira – home to 500,000 people – tearing roofs off homes and buildings and leaving death and destruction in its wake; finally, over the weekend of 16-17 March, the weather system carried torrential rains across multiple areas, causing rivers to overflow, and leaving people stranded on trees and houses. Then, on 24 April, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in the Macomia district of Cabo Delgado, flattening entire communities in its path.

This is the first time in recorded history that two strong tropical cyclones (above Category 2) have made landfall in Mozambique in the same season, and the first time that a cyclone has made landfall as far north as Kenneth. The cyclones devastated two distinct swathes of the country.

Cyclone Idai hit the central region of Mozambique, leaving an estimated 3,000km2 of land submerged and damaging more than 240,000 houses. Subsequently, Cyclone Kenneth struck the northern region, destroying more than 45,300 houses. This came on top of drought in other areas of country, as well as violence in parts of Cabo Delgado.

The cyclones have compounded an already serious food insecurity situation in Mozambique. From September to December 2018, an estimated 1.78 million people (IPC phase 3 and above) were severely food insecure in the country, according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the food security and nutrition assessment conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) in October 2018. Of these, an estimated 814,700 severely food insecure people in five provinces – Cabo Delgado, Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala and Tete - were prioritized as being in most urgent need of assistance, with the most affected provinces being Tete (more than 359,300 people) and Gaza (more than 318,200 people). Following Cyclone Idai’s landfall, more than 715,000 hectares of crops were destroyed, while Cyclone Kenneth affected nearly 55,500 hectares of crops and caused loss of livelihoods, including fishing. Both of the cyclones made landfall during the critical harvest period, effectively wiping out the food the Cyclones. of thousands of families, prolonging an already difficult lean season and leaving many without the prospect of another full harvest until March 2020. All communities in Manica and 80 per cent in Sofala have reported harvesting less than half of their maize due to Cyclone Idai.

Both Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth caused significant displacement and protection concerns. Many children, elderly and people with disabilities were unable to flee to safety and more than half of the affected people are children.

The cyclones significantly exacerbated protection risks, including sexual and gender-based violence, loss of personal documentation, and issues related to land and property rights. Already, in October 2018, families in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala were adopting crisis strategies (17 per cent) and emergency strategies (13 per cent) due to drought, including selling productive assets and animals and taking children out of school to perform household chores, including fetching water. After the cyclones, many families lost everything – their homes, their livelihoods and family members – heightening the risks of their resorting to negative coping strategies – including child labour, child trafficking and forced marriage - to survive in the months ahead. Some children have lost their parents, while others were separated from their families as they sought to reach safety.

Access to safe water was compromised by both Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth, particularly for displaced people living in collective centres, as well as people in areas where water supply was cut. Even prior to the crisis, only half of Mozambicans had access to improved water supply and only one in five use improved sanitation facilities. Most households impacted by flooding during Cyclone Idai lost access to safe sanitation, with latrines overflowing and homes destroyed. People who sought refuge in collective centres – usually schools and churches – were living in overcrowded and congested conditions with limited access to safe water.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people living in Cyclone Kenneth-affected areas lost access to water, including due to power cuts in key urban centres, such as Macomia, Mucojo and Quissanga towns. Each of these factors significantly heightened the risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera and malaria. Meanwhile, women and girls have been forced to walk longer distances to access clean water and firewood, exposing them to heightened risk of gender-based violence.

Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai caused major damage to health facilities, with at least 62 health centres damaged or destroyed. The emergency room of the Beira Central Hospital was extensively damaged during Cyclone Idai’s landfall, rendering it non-functional in the aftermath of the storm.

At the same time, community health centres lost access to supply chains for drugs, with damaged medicine being lost and were unable to open due to flooding. It is estimated that 67,000 women impacted by Cyclone Idai are reportedly pregnant, of whom 60 per cent (19,000) were expected to give birth in the three months following landfall. Meanwhile, over 7,000 pregnant women are estimated to be at risk of unsafe childbirth in areas affected by Cyclone Kenneth. The majority of these women were attending pre-natal clinics in health centres which have been destroyed or damaged. HIV prevalence in Mozambique is among the highest globally, and this disaster is expected to increase the risk of transmission as well as to jeopardise access to care for people living with HIV. In Sofala province, which bore the brunt of Cyclone Idai, at least one in six adults are HIV positive. In Buzi, several women and girls who reported having sex for money noted that more money is typically offered if they do not use condoms, exposing them to heightened risk of sexually transmitted disease.

Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai and the preceding drought are occurring in a context of chronic undernutrition.

Prior to Cyclone Idai, five districts were expected to face IPC Acute Malnutrition phase 2 or above during the 2018-2019 lean season: Balama in Cabo Delgado; Marara in Tete province; Milange in Zambezia province and Macossa in Manica province. Each of the causes of acute malnutrition in these districts - including low quality and quantity of infant feeding; increased occurrence of childhood diseases, such as diarrhoea and malaria; low coverage of health and sanitation services; and low access to safe water sources – have been exacerbated by the drought and floods. Results from the annual food security and nutrition analysis (SETSAN) prior to Cyclone Kenneth already showed a concerning food security and nutrition situation in five districts in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to conflict and violence: Macomia,

Mocimboa da Praia, Nangade, Palma and Quissanga. This includes two of the districts – Macomia and Quissanga – hardest-hit by Cyclone Kenneth.

Both drought and floods have negatively impacted children’s well-being and their access to education. The government reports that Cyclone Kenneth damaged at least 480 classrooms, affecting close to 42,000 children. Meanwhile,

Cyclone Idai damaged more than 2,800 classrooms. In addition, many children have been displaced away from their homes and schools, and many schools were initially used as collective centres for the displaced, rendering them non-functional for educational purposes. Although school has resumed in most of the affected areas, many classrooms are still damaged and in need of immediate repair and rehabilitation. In the drought-affected areas, poor concentration in class due to hunger and thirst was reported and shortage of water led to migration of the most vulnerable rural families, causing their children to drop out of school.

There are also reports of significant psychosocial support needs amongst children following the cyclones.

Extensive damage to key roads and bridges, has compromised people’s access to services and basic supplies.

The impact of cyclones Kenneth and Idai resulted in many people being unable to move freely due to the persistence of flood waters and damaged road networks. Key roads in each of the affected areas were cut for significant periods.

After Cyclone Idai, for example, the N6 was cut, leaving Beira City cut-off and disabling a key supply route in the country. In Nhamatanda, people were isolated between the Zimbabwean border and the flood-affected areas. Food prices reportedly rose by more than 100 per cent in some affected areas and transport costs in the limited accessible areas have either doubled or tripled. Poor families, who lost everything in the floods, were unable to purchase basic items. After Cyclone Kenneth, the roads to Metuge town, Mucojo Sede in Macomia, and other areas were inaccessible. The isolation of communites increases the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, as boys, girls and families become desperate for livesaving resources such as food, shelter and water. It is critical that the response reduces the risk of exploitation.

The humanitarian situation is compounded by high levels of poverty, as well as the Government’s limited fiscal space to respond effectively. Despite a downward trend in the incidence of poverty over the years, the number of poor people remains high and inequality is growing. Both Cyclones Kenneth and Idai are expected to exacerbate this situation, as recent poverty analysis conducted in Mozambique shows that cyclone, flood or drought can lead to a drop of up to 25 to 30 per cent in per capita food consumption and that affected households also cut back on expenditures in basic non-food items. The rain-dependent agricultural sector -which accounts for around 25 per cent of Mozambique’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs nearly 75 per cent of the labour force- has been hard-hit by Cyclone Idai.

This revised Humanitarian Response Plan will enable response to the most immediate and life-saving needs arising from Cyclone Idai over a three month period, along with sustained response to the pre-existing needs in drought-affected areas. It will also allow partners to immediately kick-start crucial recovery actions to begin restoring livelihoods and self-reliance, which will continue beyond the three-month horizon. Over the coming three months, the humanitarian community will review the situation, with the Government, to determine next steps, while simultaneously engaging with development partners to urge rapid action to tackle the longer-term issues resulting from the storm, including reconstruction and recovery",2019-05-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'revised', 'response', 'plan', 'idai', 'humanitarian', 'cyclone', 'following', 'including', 'kenneth', 'cyclones', 'access', '2019', 'food', 'landfall', 'areas', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
23,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"Onion Powder Prices Jump, Bad News for Potato Chip Lovers - Spend Matters",https://spendmatters.com/2014/08/04/onion-powder-prices-jump/,"Spend Matters welcomes a guest post from Jo Allen of Mintec.

Flavourings are expensive by weight. They tend to be the most expensive ingredient of many food products. Onion powder is just one of those costly ingredients. Major potato chips brands like Pringles and Lay’s rely on onion powder to create some of our favourite flavours like sour cream and onion, cheese and onion, and onion rings.

Although the dehydrated onions equate to only 2 percent of the size of the onion market in volume. They are worth up to six times the value of the fresh onion market. Global onion powder prices have been increasing year-on-year since 2012 – all in all a 20-percent price increase.

The US is the major producer of onion powder, producing over 100,000 tons annually, which accounts for around 50 percent of total global production. This is followed by India, who produces around 40,000 to 50,000 tons annually. China and Egypt each produces around 13,000 to 15,000 tons.

Last year global onion production fell in all major dehydrated onion producing countries due to drought conditions. The reduced output drove prices up in early 2013 but they were also influenced by increased input costs driven by a need for further irrigation. In the US, warm weather in March and April of 2013 led to reduced yields. So by season’s end, the US onion industry had processed 9 percent less than was estimated. This tightened supply was on top of the already low carry-over stocks left from 2012.

This year, the drought has continued causing concerns that the 2014 crop will be lower than estimated for the second year running. California, a major dehydrated onion growing state, officially declared drought conditions in mid-January. Unfortunately, the US is not the only country to be suffering with increased prices due to restricted supply. In India the new crop is expected to fall short of forecasts by 20 percent, and Egypt’s ongoing political turmoil is causing uncertainty of supply to the global market. Since current (and future) supplies of dehydrated onion product around the world are tight, there's little doubt that onion prices are going to leave us with a not-so-sweet taste in the near future.",2014-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['major', 'bad', 'supply', 'jump', 'drought', 'powder', 'onion', 'chip', 'tons', 'dehydrated', 'global', 'prices', 'lovers', 'market', 'potato']",China,news article,English

This is the third time Prof. Oquaye has taken the seat as the acting President since assuming office as the Speaker of the Seventh Parliament of the Fourth Republic of Ghana.

Prof. Oquaye's assumption of the presidential throne, Tuesday night, was occasioned by the absence of the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and his Vice, Dr Alhaji Mahamudu Bawumia, from the jurisdiction.

His swearing-in was in accordance with Article 60 (11) of the 1992 Republican Constitution which provides for the Speaker of Parliament to act in the absence of the President and his Vice.

""Where the President and the Vice-President are both unable to perform the functions of the President, the Speaker of Parliament shall perform those functions until the President or the Vice President is able to perform those functions or a new President assumes office as the case may be"" it read.

492,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Drought-hit Gedo herders living on a meal a day - Radio Ergo,https://radioergo.org/en/2021/05/05/drought-hit-gedo-herders-living-on-a-meal-a-day/,"(ERGO) – Mohamoud Mohamed Marji and his family of 10 are down to a single meal of rice a day since leaving their drought-stricken rural home in southern Somalia’s Gedo region in March, to shelter temporarily with an equally hard up relative near town.

They left the rural area of Ceel-Garaar along with many other families after the three water wells dried up in February. Since the beginning of the year, 240 of Mohamoud’s goats have died due to lack of pasture and water.

Mohamoud used $80 sent by his brother working as a casual labourer in Mogadishu to pay a tuk-tuk taxi to transport his family in two trips the 40 kilometres to the town of Luq. They are living there in a flimsy hut Mohamoud put together using cartons and plastic bags they were given by their host, who works as livestock broker.

“My family and the livestock lived a good life during the rainy seasons, but this is our life now, full of hardships despite the Gu’ rains,” he recounted sadly.

“My family used to eat three meals a day, but now getting one meal is a hustle. I don’t have livestock to sell to provide for my family. We are living with these relatives and I don’t know how long they can host us.”

Mohamoud said he tried to secure unskilled labour jobs on construction sites, but he has not been lucky. He is considering relocating his family to internal displacement camps across the border in Ethiopia’s Somali region, where he heard that the World Food Programme is providing families with wheat rations.

“I would have migrated long ago, but I don’t have the money to travel, and we can’t reach there on foot,” he said.

Families across Gedo region, one of the hardest hit by the drought and water crisis, have been moving in all directions seeking survival.

Warsame Mohamoud Isack, a pastoralist living in a rural part of Elwak district, lost 60 of his 100 goats in the drought. He was forced to migrate to Caashacad village, 75 km from Elwak town. He has accumulated $500 in debt mostly buying food from local shops for his family of 16 members.

“The past few months have been tough. The pastoralists have been forced to shift to the nearest towns for help,” said Warsame, who is living in a shelter he put up for the family.

His children are helping him graze his remaining goats in the village.

He hopes to repay his debt when his goats regain the weight they lost in the prolonged dry season, and he can sell them at a good price.

The head of Gedo region’s social affairs department, Ibrahim Mohamed Gumow, told Radio Ergo that 90,000 pastoralist and farming families have been displaced from their homes in the region since December 2020. He said there had been a double tragedy of locust invasions and the early drying up of wells.

Most of the families migrated in the last four months as conditions worsened and their livestock started to die.

However, Ibrahim said he is hopeful the Gu’ rains will ease the food shortage crisis, as some of the families were left with some livestock and the farmers are planting crops. “The current rain is not completely enough to get these displaced families back on their feet, but it will help them get pasture for their livestock,” he said.",2021-05-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['region', 'meal', 'gedo', 'food', 'living', 'day', 'rural', 'herders', 'livestock', 'mohamoud', 'goats', 'families', 'droughthit', 'family']",Somalia,news article,English
425,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghanistan: Drought - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) update n° 2; DREF n° MDRAF004 - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-drought-emergency-plan-action-epoa-update-n-2-dref-n-mdraf004,"Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:

This operation update is issued to inform one month no cost extension of the operation due to the delay of the replenishment of food parcels.

Summary of current response context

Poor precipitation during the winter of 2017/2018 in the mountainous regions of Hindu-Kush is responsible for the severe drought that hit Afghanistan in the first half of 2018, particularly over the northwestern regions. These semi-arid/arid areas rely heavily on rain and melted snow flowing from the mountains for the majority of their water resources. As most of Western Afghanistan does not receive any precipitation between June and October, the lack of it in earlier months compromises water supply for the rest of the year.

The drought caused losses to the rural communities (70 per cent of population live in rural areas) and forced people to move toward makeshift camps and cities, to avoid famine as many people have been left without enough food to feed their families. Helmand ANDMA reported about 1,400 individuals displaced from Khanshin to Lashkargah due to drought and lack of water. As part of the drought response in rural areas, WFP and its partners delivered 3,500 metric tons of food for more than 398,000 people in 13 provinces, in the last week of November (20-27 November). In the past month, more than 1.4 million people received food or cash from WFP as part of the ongoing full-scale drought response that plans to reach 2.5 million people by end of the year.

The Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) remains vigilant and have been monitoring the situation since the start of dry spell. ARCS is in close coordination with Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC). ARCS Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated to coordinate with relevant stakeholders and update on the situation on regular basis. ARCS started coordination meetings with in country movement partners since May 2018.",2019-03-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['food', 'water', 'update', 'mdraf004', 'wfp', 'epoa', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'plan', 'response', 'arcs', 'dref', 'rural', 'action', 'yearthe', 'n', 'emergency', 'areas']",Afghanistan,news article,English
846,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Michael Pavitt: Can Lima 2019 help end Peru's Olympic medal drought? - Insidethegames.biz,https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1082773/lima-2019-end-peru-olympic-medal-wait,"Panam Sports officials have spent the majority of the week sounding relieved that despite significant issues in Lima 2019’s preparations for the Games, it looks as if the continental event will turn out all right in the end.

The impression appeared to be backed up yesterday when a Lima 2019 weakness looked to have contributed to the host nation enjoying double gold on the first morning of the Games.

Both the men’s and women’s marathons, it has been suggested, were moved from the end of the Games to the start to coincide with national holidays when the normally gridlocked roads of the capital might prove quieter and more manageable.

The result was an immediate boost for organisers, with Gladys Tejeda and Cristhian Pacheco’s victories in the two distance races giving the host nation gold medals.

The triumphs for Peru appear to have given the Games early momentum among the local population.

Another benefit was that Tejeda’s victory was a good story in itself, given that she saw her Toronto 2015 gold taken away over a positive drug test.

Whether you take the controversial view or the local Peruvian angle that Tejeda had gained revenge for being stripped of the title four years ago for an allegedly inadvertent case, it is clearly a positive for Lima 2019 that people are talking, writing and reading about the Pan American Games.

Pacheco certainly played his part by completing the marathon double, leading to front page spreads of the Peruvian runners standing next to the country’s President Martín Vizcarra on the podium, hoisting their nation’s flag.

The distance runner then gave further promotion to the Games today, when he suggested the event could have a lasting effect. Pacheco insisted success at a home Games would show that Peruvian athletes could compete for and win Olympic medals.

Following his comments and the subsequent standing ovation from local journalists, I was surprised to discover that Peru, remarkably, have only won four Olympic medals. Shooter Edwin Vásquez, who died in 1993, remains their only Olympic champion, his triumph coming at London 1948.

The other medals were a women's volleyball silver at Seoul 1988, along with shooting silvers at Los Angeles 1984 and Barcelona 1992.

I wonder whether Lima 2019 could help to end this drought.

You suspect the home Games could lead to a greater number of Peruvian athletes locking up Tokyo 2020 qualification places due to the benefit of competing in front of a home crowd.

After all, the early indicators are that the host nation will vastly surpass the three gold, three silver and six bronze they earned four years ago in Toronto, given the Peruvian team matched the achievement on the first day here.

Panam Sports Coordination Commission head Keith Joseph earlier this week did what sporting officials do regularly, as he suggested the Games would deliver a great future for young people.

“Our projects are meaningful, impactful and sustainable,” he said. “What we have here is a milestone that will impact the lives of Peruvians, impact the lives of the people of Lima and impact the youth of the Americas.”

The President of Lima 2019, Carlos Neuhaus, went a little further.

""Lima 2019 has consolidated a new generation of Peruvians with new facilities,” he said. “Let's take this opportunity to make sport the centre of our lives. Peru has as its new standard ambitious projects made according to our needs.

“We did it together, the success belongs to everyone, together we are achieving the most spectacular event in our history. We win together, united.""

Cristhian Pacheco claimed success at the Games showed Peru could produce Olympic medallists ©Getty Images

This is a topic that is contentious and used regularly by opponents to multi-sport events.

Events like the London 2012 Olympic Games have promised to inspire millions to get off the couch and become more active. But they have repeatedly been found to have had limited or no impact on participation levels.

Personally, I am unconvinced that the Peruvian population will suddenly take up sports like rugby sevens having had the opportunity to watch them at the Games.

I suspect the sports that were popular prior to the Games, such as football, will remain that way in two weeks’ time when the event draws to a close.

But if we focus entirely on a high-performance perspective, it seems possible that the Games could help Peru.

Neuhaus pointed out at the Panam Sports General Assembly that the Games had led to legislation being introduced to boost the provision of sport in schools in Peru.

While it might not necessarily lead to medal success in Japan’s capital city next year, you wonder whether it could lead to greater talent-spotting with potential stars of the future being found.

If we are to believe the hype from Lima 2019 and Panam Sports, the new venues are the best in the region.

Why then shouldn’t the facilities built for the Pan American Games here ultimately help to deliver long-term medal success for Peru at both Pan American and Olympic Games level?

This will undoubtedly be the long-term task for Peruvian sporting bodies, who will hope to utilise the facilities to bring back Olympic medals to Lima.

It will be interesting to see over the next couple of weeks whether Peru’s staging of the Pan American Games has led to new talent emerging with the potential of securing podium finishes at Tokyo 2020.",2019-07-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['drought', 'olympic', 'michael', 'pan', 'success', '2019', 'help', 'end', 'medal', 'lima', 'peruvian', 'peru', 'games', 'pavitt', 'impact', 'perus', 'gold']",Ghana,news article,English
1396,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Why is basement flooding on the rise across Canada? - Insurance Business Canada,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/flood/why-is-basement-flooding-on-the-rise-across-canada-188720.aspx,"Flooding is also exacerbated by the loss of natural infrastructure and the ageing of municipal infrastructure. Filippi commented: “More and more people are moving into higher density cities and areas. This is causing a loss of natural infrastructure. Many local municipalities in Canada don’t have a lot of money. How do they make their money? They let developers build new homes and they collect taxes from them. But what’s happening is that they’re taking away a lot of that natural infrastructure – the trees, the wetlands and the parks.

“Natural infrastructure allows for more infiltration when there’s major rainfall. If you’re developing or paving over that natural infrastructure, the water is going to go to the lowest common denominator, and that’s going to be the homes at lowest level in that city or municipality. They’re the ones that are going to be flooded first, and they’re the ones that are going to be seeing these costly basement claims. Ageing infrastructure creates similar problems. Municipalities aren’t updating infrastructure enough because they don’t have the money, which again causes water infiltration issues.”

Another key issue causing a rise in basement flooding is the lack of flood protection measures at a household level. This is where the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation hopes its Home Flood Protection Program will start to make some waves. Launched in 2016, the residential flood risk reduction education program helps Canadians by providing free online flood protection resources, training programs, and a nationally applicable flood risk assessment tool.

“A lot of homeowners don’t know how to implement simple flood risk management in their basements,” said Filippi. “According to the IBC, the average cost for homeowners to repair their damaged basement is $43,000. But as more people are finishing their basements, that’s where they’re keeping the lifeblood of their homes – the water heater, the AC, all of this important stuff - which is going to be impacted first in the event of a flood. The basement, which historically used to be a storage area for people is now a new living area as people try to grow the square footage of their home.”

According to the Home Flood Protection Program, there are three steps homeowners can take to reduce their risk of basement flooding and lower the cost of clean-up if flooding occurs. The first step revolves around maintenance and involves things homeowners can do themselves for no additional cost. It includes actions like: removing debris from storm drains, cleaning out eaves troughs, maintaining plumbing fixtures, testing sump pumps, and cleaning out backwater valves.

The second step involves completing simple home upgrades, often for less than $250. That might be installing window well covers, installing flood alarms, extending downspouts and sump discharge pipes at least two metres from the home foundation, and buying watertight containers to store valuable or hazardous materials.

Finally, the third step homeowners can take involves making more complex upgrades, which often requires work with a contractor and can cost over $250. A few suggestions include: installing a backup sump pump and battery, installing a backwater valve, correcting the grading to direct water away from a home’s foundation, and installing window wells. For some of the items in this step, some municipalities offer flood protection subsidies, so homeowners and brokers are advised to check on that before making the investment.",2019-10-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['rise', 'water', 'infrastructure', 'theyre', 'homeowners', 'going', 'canada', 'protection', 'flood', 'basement', 'installing', 'flooding', 'step']",Canada,news article,English

...is running out of options. During the past few months, rain has refused to fall. He watched his land turn into dust and his livestock die. Like hundreds of thousands of others, he has brought his family to the city of Herat, set up small camps by the roadside and trying to survive.

Over 260,000 people have so far been displaced by drought across four provinces in western Afghanistan and Herat province is one of the worst affected areas.

This is one of the worst drought Ghulam could remember. As winter arrives, temperatures at night is dropping down to close to zero degree centigrade.

""Some nights none of these families here have any food, we go sleep hungry and cold. We all have lost so much to this drought."" ----Ghulam

HEALTH RISKS

The drought is yet another burden on a country still wracked by violence. With a fragile health system, the displaced people are faced with a significant shortage of primary health services. The risk of communicable diseases is very high in displacement camps, as well as areas of origin for those affected by drought. Cases of acute watery diarrhea are affecting more than 40 percent of households in displaced sites. Measles are more prevalent than previously reported. Existing health services are unable to cope with the increase demand in the areas of origin and are now out of essential medicines and supplies.

MOBILE CLINICS

Dr. Salehi works at the mobile clinic in one of the informal settlements on the outskirts of Herat city.

""Pneumonia and diarrhoea are common here. Eye infections and skin diseases are on the increase because of lack of water, measles, colds can spread quickly because people are malnourished, their immune system is weak, and we are their only source of healthcare."" Said Dr.Salehi.

NEW MOTHER Aliah came to Herat city from Ghor province. She brought her six months old baby to the mobile clinic for assessment of malnutrition. Mothers are often given iron and vitamin supplements and instructions about their health condition. The services are still far from enough. ""We've seen women often come in with birth complications and the closest healthcare centre is more than an hour's drive away,"" says Fatima, a midwife, ""with the drought, some small complications became serious.""

42% of the households in drought affected districts report a total lack of antenatal care.

WHO IN DROUGHT-HIT AREAS

More than 45,000 people have received health services under the Health Cluster led by WHO. ""We are providing all possible support to address the ongoing challenges. We support the Basic Package of Health Services for implementers to begin rapid responses to areas of greatest threats. We are sending medicines and medical supplies to health facilities in prioritized drought-affected areas."" Says Dr. David Lai, the Health Cluster coordinator at WHO afghanistan, who visits the drought-hit regions regularly to assess the situation.

""This really is a coordinated effort among different agencies, and we've had a lot of support from different donors. For example, the Republic of Korea has been supporting the Health Cluster to help the Afghans who are in dire need during this drought. ""

GHULAM’S FAMILY PLAN

Fara is one of Ghulam’s daughter-in-law. This morning, she brought her 6 months old daughter to mobile health facility supported by WHO. ""If we had any money we would have never come here. Our bad luck brought us here,"" she says. Her daughter is being treated for diarrheal disease. Her other son, who is 3 years old is in hospital being treated for severe acute malnutrition.

Ghulam and his family are stuck. They don't know where they can go next or what would happen to them. While the government of Afghanistan has a plan is in place to move some of the displaced to a more stable site gradually, winter has arrived. More food is needed, better health services have to be provided for those in Herat and other provinces affected by drought.

In the last few days, some of the worst flooding ever recorded — triggered by cyclone Idai — has devastated southeast Africa. Storm surge floods up to six meters (about 20 feet) deep have destroyed nearly 90 percent of Mozambique, as well as neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi, decimating almost all water and power infrastructure.

Between extreme floods and drought, global warming is disrupting the planet's water cycle.

Worldwide flooding

Across the Atlantic, flooding in the US state of Nebraska has been so bad an entire city was walled off from the outside world. In southeast Asia, more than 80 people have been killed in flash floods brought on by torrential rain in the Papua Province of Indonesia. Some areas of the province recorded almost 200 mm (7.8 inches) of rain in 24 hours.

A hotter global climate — in which a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture — is causing stronger, more frequent rainfall. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined in their 2018 report, it's likely that anthropogenic influences have affected the global water cycle since 1960.

Heavy rainfall and floods are a natural part of the world's weather cycle, but climate change is exacerbating them.

Drought, heat and fire

On the other end of the spectrum of extremes, vital water sources — like lakes, rivers and wetlands — are drying up. For places like Iraq, Australia and China, drought, heat and fire are becoming the new normal.

In China, 28,000 rivers and waterways have dried up over the past 25 years. The country's Yellow River — the second-longest in Asia — is now a mere tenth of what it once was in the 1940s. In late 2018, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao said the nation's acute water crisis was a threat to its very survival.

Parts of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, one of the country's biggest water networks, have experienced huge drops in flows in recent years. Extended drought, prompted by intense heatwaves, in part led to the death of one million fish in the basin over a two-week period in January 2019.

In the Middle East, the Mesopotamian marshlands in southern Iraq, once the largest wetland ecosystem in Western Eurasia, are at risk of disappearing after years of drought.

While the links between some weather extremes and climate change are more complicated than others, Jascha Lehmann from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says the line drawn between floods, drought and global warming is clear.

""There is a lot of evidence pointing to the fact that climate change means we have more weather extremes globally, and this is especially true for heat extremes, for heavy rainfall events and for droughts,"" he told DW.

Pegged to gain an extra 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 if emissions aren't reduced, the world's climate may yet see the worst of such extremes.

The secret is in the soil

One important impact of temperature rise is greater evaporation rates and plant transpiration, which leads to drier soils. When rainfall does occur, these dry soils absorb more of it.

This, according to Ashish Sharma, professor from the school of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New South Wales, is a crucial aspect of climate change's impact on the water cycle.

A study Sharma co-authored on the topic found that where soils were once moist before heavy rainfall and storms — allowing excess rainfall to runoff into lakes and rivers — they are now so dry they absorb most of the water.

This means, in many parts of the world, increased rainfall is contributing less to ""blue water"" that flows through lakes, rivers and dams and is extracted for human use, and more to ""green water,"" which is soaked up by the landscape.

""What's happening is the first significant chunk of the rainfall has to be used up to wet the soil before the overland flow can occur and before the big flood can form,"" Sharma told DW.

This is more so the case with ""moderate"" floods that flow into dams, the professor said, rather than extreme floods, which tend to lead to more rapid movement of the water from the atmosphere back into the oceans — preventing it from being stored and used.

""It's these moderate floods that supply water to our dams and it's the dams that basically give us water for our irrigation systems for our communities,"" Sharma said. The problem, Sharma surmised, ""is the temperature rise.""

An entire state in Australia was declared in drought for the second half of 2018

Water wars

Less water in our rivers, lakes and dams means less water for drinking, sanitation, food production, energy, and many other vital uses. It can also fuel conflict, and drive people from their homelands.

Age-old tribes like the Marsh Arabs in Iraq are being deprived of their livelihoods on the marshlands. The worst drought in Syria's history, from 2007 to 2010, has been credited as triggering political unrest and instability in the region, leading to a surge of refugees into Europe.

As Friederike Otto, associate professor at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University outlines — and as climate change is continually showing — it is the world's poorest and most marginalized that disproportionately suffer.

""It's important in these debates not to forget just who and what is in harm's way, about vulnerability and exposure, by blaming [all extreme weather events] on climate change,"" she told DW.

""We shouldn't assume that just because it's 'climate change' that we can't do anything. We can.""",2019-03-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['struggling', 'mozambique', 'change', 'climate', 'freshwater', 'deluge', 'idai', 'devastates', 'sources', 'extreme', 'drought', 'zimbabwe', 'worst', 'weather', 'floods', 'rainfall', 'replenish', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
80,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Debal Deb | The barefoot conservator - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/bmr5i8vBw06RDiNFms2swK/Debal-Deb--The-barefoot-conservator.html,"The Sunday morning in July marked the fifth straight day of rain in the fecund foothills of the Niyamgiri range in western Odisha’s Rayagada district. The delayed showers heralded the year’s busiest period for ecologist Debal Deb and his right-hand man Dulal as they prepared Basudha—a 2-acre farm unlike any other in India—for an intricately planned growing season.

Wrap your mind around this: Over the coming days, the farm would see the planting of 1,020 indigenous varieties of rice—part of a remarkable effort under way since 1996 to rescue a sliver of India’s genetic diversity from extinction.

This wouldn’t just mean planting 1,000 varieties of rice saplings on a plot one-tenth the size of Mumbai’s Oval Maidan, and watching them grow. Maintaining the genetic purity of each of these heirloom varieties, year on year, necessitates an intricate sowing plan crafted by Deb, 53, and his colleagues, so that no two neighbouring varieties flower at the same time, thus guarding against cross-pollination. Deb published his methodology in the Current Science journal in July 2006, after field-testing it for six years. The constant addition of vanishing varieties to Deb’s growing collection—last year, it numbered 960—means the plan needs seasonal redesigning.

Rice—daily sustenance for a majority of Indians—is a grass species, believed to have been domesticated over 7,000 years ago in a broad region extending from the north-eastern Himalayan foothills to southern China and South-East Asia. Over the centuries, human hands selected thousands of different strains, evolved in response to specific ecological niches. The undulating region of western Odisha, called the Jeypore tract, was one of the world’s leading areas of diversification, where a great number of rice varieties, also called landraces, were developed by cultivators—“the unnamed, unknown, and greatly talented scientists of the past,"" as Deb describes them.

In the 1960s, when Deb was growing up in Kolkata, India was estimated to have over 70,000 such rice landraces. According to a 1991 National Geographic essay, just 20 years later, with scientists and policymakers chasing high yields through aggressively pushed modern, input-intensive hybrids, over 75% of India’s rice production was coming from less than 10 varieties.

This devastating and irreversible genetic erosion from India’s farms continues: For example, rice varieties from West Bengal that Deb collected just five years ago are no longer being cultivated. The disappearance is insidious. “It can result from something as innocuous as a farmer dying, and his son dropping the variety,"" says Deb. “I witnessed this on a farm in Birbhum, with a rare two-grained variety called Jugal.""

An Indian Institute of Science alumnus and a former Fulbright Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, US, Deb abandoned his job at the World Wildlife Fund in the mid-1990s after struggling to convince colleagues to fund documentation of Bengal’s vanishing rice varieties. “Conservation organizations suffer from what I call mega-fauna species syndrome,"" he says, acerbically. “Tigers—yes. Rhinos—yes. But if some earthworms or beetles are going extinct because of chemical pollutants on a farm, who cares?""

Deb headed out to villages in search of indigenous rice, often travelling on bus rooftops or by foot; an iconoclast by temperament, the small, wiry man still abjures institutional links, relying on teaching assignments in European and American universities and donations from friends to sustain Basudha. He particularly sought out areas that were remote, un-irrigated, and had marginal farmers who could not afford chemical inputs and seeds from the market. “The places Indian elites like to call ‘backward’, such as tribal areas, were those with the greatest chances of having retained these varieties over time,"" says Deb. “When I would find such a variety, I would ask the farmer’s family for a handful, explain why I wanted it, thank them for preserving a vital part of our heritage, and urge them to not give up cultivating it.""

Deb has collected 1,020 desi rice varieties over the past 18 years. They come from 13 states across north-eastern, eastern and southern India. Kashmir, with two indigenous varieties, is the latest entrant to the seed bank, which Deb has named Vrihi, Sanskrit for rice. There are seeds that will grow in soils with high salinity, or conditions of submergence; others are drought- or flood-tolerant; yet others are resistant to attacks from varying pathogens; some are suited to dryland cultivation. There are medicinal varieties as well as 88 aromatic varieties.

These landraces—embodying centuries of accumulated knowledge—and farmers who can work with them are crucial for sustainable ecological agriculture, argues Deb. Annual seed conservation training and a distribution effort centred on the small farmer complement his in-situ conservation project, resulting in an informal personal network of about 3,000 cultivators.

Farmers who approach Basudha for seeds get them free of cost, with a plea to grow them and in turn become distributors to other farmers, to help reduce the chances of the variety becoming extinct.

Last December, having heard of the seed bank, 40 Malkangiri farmers travelled over 200km to Basudha’s doorstep and demanded indigenous seeds for their farms. “Not one asked about yield or market price,"" says Deb. “It was a very moving moment for us."" Deb is also proud that the farm stands on common land in Rayagada’s Adivasi village of Kerandiguda: its residents invited Deb after taking seeds from his bank, and hearing that he was in search of a place to house his project.

The communitarian ethos defining Deb’s work contrasts sharply with agricultural policymaking, where the voices of the small farmer—the largest group of Indians—are often impossible to detect. Take, for example, a gene bank built in recent years by the Odisha government. Located in a government building in Bhubaneswar, 900 varieties from across the state are sealed in aluminium foil packets, and preserved at zero degrees in an impressive facility. It is a laudable effort. Only, how does an average farmer access it?

Officials watching over the collection say they cannot give farmers seed samples to cultivate since these might fall into the wrong hands (seed companies that might exploit the genes for developing new proprietary seed lines). Never mind that the entire collection was built with farmer contributions from across the state. Why does the state not officially release these desi varieties in the market to encourage use and, thereby, survival? The release process, admit bureaucrats, is skewed towards modern, commercial varieties developed by breeders in government labs or private seed companies.

Besides being inaccessible to the average farmer, says Deb, official gene banks neglect the process of life’s co-evolution by freezing seeds in time. “Bring out seeds of a pest-resistant variety after 30-40 years. They will have lost some major traits of defence since in the meantime the pest has evolved,"" he says. “They might be useful for research but are not geared towards our farmers in the field.""

Deb counters the official argument that indigenous varieties result in inferior yields: “I have several varieties which outperform the so-called high-yielding varieties."" High yields do not ensure food security, he reminds, pointing out that India is home to record stockpiles of rice and wheat, as well as a quarter of the world’s undernourished.

Over lunch—greens, vegetables, dal and rice combining eight different varieties from the farm—Deb asks if we can evaluate our heirlooms in money. “Imagine a unique painting, a sari...an ornament which has been in your family for 200 years—would you sell it off to make money?"" he asks. “That’s how these indigenous rice varieties are—they are our culture.""

618,Drought Sri Lanka,Government aims to tackle drought - The Phnom Penh Post,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/government-aims-tackle-drought,"Government aims to tackle drought

The Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts on Monday said that 100 per cent of people in urban areas will have reliable access to clean water by 2025 as the government takes action to tackle drought and other effects of climate change.

The World Health Organization has predicted that between 2030 and 2050 climate change will kill 250,000 people a year, with 38,000 deaths from extreme heat. Food shortages are expected to kill 95,000 children.

A 2015 UN Risk Report showed that Cambodia is the world’s ninth most vulnerable country for disaster, with the economy, agriculture, health and education sectors likely to be affected.

Ministry secretary of state Um Sotha said government policy aimed for 100 per cent of people living in urban areas to have reliable access to clean water, with 90 per cent part of the piped water system and the remaining 10 per cent to receive it from other sources.

Sotha was speaking at a workshop on Monday hosted by the ministry and attended by civil society organisations and around 200 sub-national government officials and representatives of clean water supply operations from across the country.

He said the ministry has expressed concerns over future droughts and has ordered its municipal and provincial officials to study the matter.

“We are worried about this problem and have instructed our provincial and municipal departments to work with their counterparts at the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology to study it.""

“We regard the study of how the supply of water will be affected during dry seasons with no rain and how many cubic metres can be supplied as an urgent task.""

“Private clean water suppliers get their water from existing sources, but if a natural disaster was to occur, it is possible they will not be able to do this.""

“Therefore, the state needs to intervene because water sources depend on geography – some areas have it but some do not. This is the challenge,” Sotha said.

He said that while some areas were facing water shortages, private suppliers nationwide were yet to fill the need.

Ieng Vongrithy, representative of Prek Thmey Water Supply in Kandal province’s Koh Thom district, told The Post that while his operation has not faced water shortages as it is located on the Mekong River, it does face technical issues.

“I do not worry because I can supply the people with enough clean water, both in rainy and dry seasons. But I want to ask for technical and financial support because we run a small operation and usually face such issues,” he said.

Chheang Sokha, a representative of Kampong Trach Clean Water Supply in Kampot province’s Kampong Trach district, told The Post on Monday that though his operation was yet to experience water shortages, he was worried about the situation as the weather was predicted to become hotter in the future.

A boy carries a bucket of water during a drought in Banteay Meanchey province in 2016. The government has said all people in urban areas will have reliable access to clean water by 2025 to combat drought from climate change. Hong Menea

“[Droughts have occurred] several times and caused difficulties for people when my operation does not have enough water for them.""

“At the moment, the ministry informs us beforehand and we are prepared. When my area lacks water, we try to find it from another source as we have the main system to control the flow of water,” he said.

Ministry of Water Resources spokesmen Chan Yutha, Yin Savuth and Mao Hak could not be reached for comment on Monday.

In January, the Ministry of Water Resources forecasts that this year’s dry season will be hotter than normal, especially during April and May, with temperatures hitting 40-42 degree Celsius as the weather is affected by the El Nino cycle, which last occurred in 2016.

Ministry of Rural Development spokesman Chan Darong told The Post on Monday that the ministry has set goals for 100 per cent of people living in remote areas to have a reliable supply of clean water by 2025. The ministry is prepared for drought in remote areas this year, he said.

“The ministry’s measures are to bore deep wells to ensure enough water for the whole year when we are faced with drought.""

“However, we do not dare to think our measures will be 100 per cent effective because we do not know how serious the drought will be,” Darong said.",2019-02-12 08:00:00+00:00,"['shortages', 'reliable', 'ministry', 'supply', 'clean', 'operation', 'water', 'cent', 'drought', 'aims', 'tackle', 'areas']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

From now until the end of the current year, the drought will impact on more than 4,7 million people.

This is according to the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee's recently-concluded Rural Livelihood Assessment.

The World Food Programme (WFP) urgently requires US$173 million (R2,4 billion) to address the food shortage crisis.

Zimbabwe's food deficits are blamed on poor rainfall and flooding caused by Cyclone Idai in March.

WFP stated the 5,5 million people to be in need of food aid represented 59 percent of rural households.

""Given the scale and scope of the food insecurity in Zimbabwe, WFP is planning to scale up to assist over 2 million people by the peak of the lean season during early next year,"" said WFP spokesperson, Herve Verhoosel.

Until then, the organisation would continue providing food assistance to the most vulnerable populations, while also assisting communities build resilience to climate change and future shock impacts.

Formerly an exporter of grain, Zimbabwe has suffered successive droughts and food deficits over the past two decades.

This has coincided with controversial land reforms by the administration of now-deposed president, Robert Mugabe.

KEY MESSAGES

• Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present in some areas affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai and Kenneth and drought, and conflict in Cabo Delgado. Due to ongoing humanitarian assistance and above average second season harvest, Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes are present in areas of Sofala and Manica provinces. In October, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to be widespread as many poor households have limited to no food stocks and incomes. In these areas, poor households are likely to have limited or no food stocks or income and in need of urgent humanitarian food assistance.

• Emergency food assistance is transitioning to early recovery assistance in the cyclone affected areas; however, funding is insufficient to meet the need. Roughly 67 percent of the plan is funded, only meeting about 40 percent of the estimated need. Humanitarian assistance funding for southern areas affected by drought is limited. These areas are also in need of assistance to close food consumption gaps and protect livelihoods, particularly during the lean season from October to January.

• According to international forecasts, the most likely ENSO phase through February 2020 is neutral. Despite ENSO neutral conditions, the 2019/20 rainfall season is most likely to start late with above average rainfall in the north and below average in the southern region. This is expected to delay agriculture labor availability as well as the availability of green foods.

• In July, maize grain and meal and rice prices remained relatively stable.

Across monitored markets, July maize grain prices on average remained well above last years’ prices by nearly 45 percent and 20 percent above the five-year average.

The small family business has come a long way since its creation, three generations earlier.

Olivier Thibaut, expert in communication and graphic designer, joined his father Bertrand in the company about 10 years ago. To the experience with the orchards was then added an ambition to diversify, which gave birth to a workshop for processing fruit juices and to local sales.

Olivier Thibaut

A production valued in its entirety thanks to the juice processing workshop

Besides differentiating it from other farms, the juice processing workshop has allowed the company to enhance the value of its entire harvest. “We have almost no waste. All the slightly damaged fruits are processed into juice. We also help our neighbors add value to their fruits, for example, when scab problems occur, or when frost damages their harvest.”

The activity has been profitable since last year, but setting it up required a lot of hard work. “We built the workshop 8 years ago. But at the beginning, we could not find any qualified employee to help us get started. So I learned everything on the job.” A few years later, this self-taught juice producer recruited employees which he himself trained.

His efforts paid off and last year, the company sold, to large retailers and directly at the farm, nearly 200,000 bottles of 100% natural non-filtered juice and non-alcoholic sparkling fruit juices. The company also received a gold medal for its apple-pear juice in 2018, and a gold medal for its apple juice and apple-pear juice in 2019.

A desire to bring consumers closer to the producers

In addition to his juice processing workshop, Olivier was one of the first to set up, upon his arrival at the company, direct sales and picking in the orchards. “This brought some income before the harvest. We train the visitors so everything goes smoothly during the picking. It is also an opportunity for them to understand how an orchard works, and to see that, unlike what they hear on TV, there is biodiversity in the orchards,” explains Olivier. An activity which benefits everyone. At 1.00-1.20 €/kg [0.50-0.61 $/lb] for apples and 1.40 €/kg [0.71 $/lb] for kiwis, Olivier and Bertrand offer producer prices.

For a few years now, father and son have been opening the gates of their orchards on the first weekend of the fall holidays, which they have called “Vitamin Days”. For the occasion, a small concert is given and a market of local producers is held on the Sunday. “It is an opportunity for people to come visit the orchards, to pick Chantecler apples and kiwis.” A successful event, since the orchards welcomed 2,500 visitors last year, which is 500 more than the previous year.

Multiple ongoing projects

When it comes to projects, Olivier is full of ideas. After modernizing his bottle labels, the manager is now targeting new markets. “The demand is increasing and people consume more and more locally. We would now like to touch the fast-food industry and we plan to offer other formats for our juices. We are also working on a deposit system, but for this, retailers must get involved.”

Olivier also wants to expand and modernize the site. “We are making an expansion of 21,528 square feet and we have installed solar panels on the roofs. There is a plan to buy another juice production line and to create a parking-lot in order to receive our clientele.”

Cholera Oral Vaccination 2020

Ministry of Health will next month embark on Cholera vaccination in flood-prone areas following reports of anticipated heavy rains.



Oral Cholera Vaccine is used as part of the Ministry of Health’s Integrated Cholera prevention and control strategy. The others include the provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and high-quality case management.



Dr Joyce Moriku, the State Minister for Primary Health Care, says that the government has imported additional 1 Million vaccines which will be rolled out in May to complete vaccination of those that had earlier received the first dose last year 2020.



//Cue in: “In November 2020…



Cue out: districts as mentions.”//



According to Moriku, the flood-prone districts include Kasese, Busia, Namayingo, Obongi, Madi-Okolo, Ntoroko targeting to reach between 800,000 and one million people. These received the first dose and have been considered high-risk areas to flood reports during the rainy season.



During the floods, the districts face threats of an outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases. In Kasese district, River Nyamwamba bursts its banks displacing several people and washing away latrines. The residents also deposit human waste in polythene bags and dump it in the flowing water.



Dr Godfrey Bwire, the Assistant Commissioner of Public Health Emergency, urged the public to also follow preventive guidelines like regular hand washing, opening up drainage channels, drinking boiled water and clearing bushes around their homes.

In September 2018, the government launched a national cholera vaccination campaign that aimed to vaccinate over one million people in cholera prone areas.



Cholera is an infection caused by bacteria and affects the intestines. The main symptoms are watery diarrhoea and vomiting. This may result in dehydration and severe cases of greyish-bluish skin.

131,Drought Sri Lanka,"With drought looming, Sri Lanka tries something new: preparing - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-drought-resilience-idUSKBN1520X6,"COLOMBO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With rainfall in many areas just a third of that last year and many water reservoirs far below normal levels, Sri Lankans have begun holding traditional ceremonies to invoke rain – some with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena.

But this time, national officials are also doing something new to prepare for what many fear could be the worst drought in decades: Developing plans, in advance, to deal with it.

Those include everything from allowing communities to take only drinking water from drying reservoirs to removing taxes on imported rice and looking for alternatives to hydropower to maintain the national electric grid.

“The change came about because we were able to predict the onset of the drought well in advance and with detailed information,” said Lalith Chandrapala, the head of Sri Lanka’s Meteorological Department.

The country has had clear signs since last October that drought was coming, officials say. During 2016, Sri Lanka had only one period of exceptionally high rainfall, with some areas receiving over 300 mm (11 inches) of rain in three days, leading to flooding and landslides.

Apart from that, rain was less than normal almost all year. “We have a rainfall deficit and it is likely to stay that way until the next monsoon” in June and July, Chandrapala said.

According to the Meteorological Department, in some districts rainfall has been 30 to 40 percent of normal levels. Some of these districts are also among the country’s largest agriculture producers.

LESS RICE, LESS POWER

The lack of rainfall severely affected paddy rice production in the last growing season. According to the Disaster Management Center (DMC) only around 300,000 hectares out of a possible 800,000 were cultivated, largely because of a lack of irrigation water.

Reservoirs that will provide water for the next growing season, which starts in March, need to be at least half filled by that time to support a normal harvest. But DMC officials and Chandrapala said the country’s main reservoirs were currently less than a third full.

“It nothing like I have ever seen before,” said Ranjith Punyawardena, an agro-climatologist at the Department of Agriculture.

The lack of water is likely both to hurt agriculture and cut into supplies of vital hydropower. Already, as a result of drought, the country is getting 80 percent of its electricity from coal and oil and only 11 percent from hydropower.

Normally, at this time of year, the country would get at least 40 percent of its electricity from hydropower, according to the electricity board.

MAKING PLANS

To deal with the coming problems, Sri Lanka has set up a cross-ministry committee to come up with an action plan, said Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.

The committee includes high ranking officials representing agriculture, power, disaster management, finance and meteorology and has been meeting every two weeks, with meetings expected to become weekly from the middle of January on.

In an effort to stabilize rice prices in the market the government removed all taxes on rice imports on Jan. 7. Rice imports are expected rise in the next two months as available local stocks dwindle.

According to Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, minister of power and energy, the government is also prepared to enter into short term power-supply agreements with private companies to meet any further drop in hydropower production capacity.

The inter-ministerial committee is expected to launch a national power and water conservation program as well.

The committee has recommended that water use from national reservoirs be strictly monitored, something that has not be done in the past. Water from some of the reservoirs already has been limited for drinking purposes only.

“This time we are taking some precautions. Hopefully they will help us ease the worst impact” of the drought, Chandrapala said.",2017-01-18 08:00:00+00:00,"['reservoirs', 'tries', 'national', 'preparing', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'hydropower', 'officials', 'looming', 'rice', 'normal']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
1116,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Farmers are committing suicide as drought in southern Africa reaches crisis levels - New York Post,https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/farmers-are-committing-suicide-as-drought-in-southern-africa-reaches-crisis-levels/,"VOSBURG, South Africa — Residents call this drought-stricken community a “forgotten town.”

The flat, dusty roads to Vosburg are surrounded by withered fields. The streams feeding the community of a few thousand people have gone dry. Signs warn drivers of wandering cattle and sheep but there are none in sight.

The months-long drought is affecting most of southern Africa. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people now face crisis levels of food insecurity in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where two cyclones wiped out crops earlier this year.

Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.

Commercial sheep farmer Louis van der Merwe, 64, broke down as he described losing more than 400 sheep and 450 springboks in the past two years because of the worst drought he has seen in 45 years of farming.

Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.

“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”

Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.

Northern Cape province will need over $28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’ organization Agri-SA.

So far, South Africa’s government has pledged $2 million.

The World Food Program says southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, with small-scale farmers feeling it most.

Some like 55-year-old Gertruida Buffel, have resorted to sharing their own food with their animals.

For two weeks she had fed two tiny lambs a mixture of maize meal and water after their mother starved to death. When The Associated Press arrived at her home, she had just learned that one had died.

“It must have died because it has only been eating the maize meal mixture. It is not their natural diet,” Buffel said.

Small children are hungry, too.

At Vosburg’s only school, Delta Primary School, scores of children line up every morning for what becomes both breakfast and lunch: usually corn meal, vegetables and soup.

While the school food program began before the drought, teachers say it has become increasingly vital for the town’s struggling families.

“It’s very hard for the parents to actually feed their children at home,” said one teacher, Xolile Ngxathu.

In the regional center of Kimberley a few hours’ drive away, government officials spend their days trying to allocate money from the $2 million provincial disaster relief fund. It is a daunting task as some farmers in far-flung areas cannot be reached easily.

Farmers Jan Louw, 65 and Martiens Tieties, 67, are among those relying on government-sponsored animal feed but are not expecting their next rations until January.

Until then, they rely on commercial farmers sharing feed to keep their few livestock alive.

The Rev. Jaco Heymans with the Dutch Reformed Church has been offering spiritual counseling to many farmers and farm workers in Vosburg.

“The drought is having a devastating impact on the people emotionally and spiritually because financially, all is almost lost,” Heymans said.

“Many people have already canceled their insurance policies and their medical aid in order to just survive. Primary concern is to keep the animals alive, so everything that is spared goes into feeding sheep.”

The drought is even blurring the divisions left by racially-based planning under South Africa’s harsh apartheid system that ended 25 years ago — with more affluent and mainly white residents living in developed areas and black and mixed-race residents in under-resourced townships.

Vosburg is no exception. With the stress of the drought, residents realize they need each other more than ever to survive. Large commercial farms are sharing animal feed with small-scale farmers. The church now counsels everyone from well-off farm owners to farm laborers who fear losing their jobs.

The end is not yet in sight. Christien Engelbrecht, a meteorologist at the South African Weather Service, said below normal rainfall is predicted for the country and the southern African region over the next three months.

“It is clear that southern African farmers, water managers and government entities need to prepare,” Engelbrecht said.",2019-11-21 08:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'sheep', 'south', 'southern', 'crisis', 'farmers', 'van', 'suicide', 'feed', 'drought', 'sharing', 'food', 'levels', 'committing', 'residents', 'reaches']",Mozambique,news article,English

295,FF-2016-000062-IDN,What China's successful reforestation program means for the rest of the world - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-06-27/what-chinas-successful-reforestation-program-means-rest-world,"Forest recovery was seen particularly in mountain regions, including the Min Mountains pictured here, and in areas that had previously been cut down by logging companies. (Photo: Andrés Viña)

After major flooding in 1998, China introduced the Natural Forest Conservation Program, a logging ban to help protect against erosion and rapid runoff. A recent study in Science Advances of 10 years of satellite data found significant recovery in some Chinese forests.

But it's not all good news. Andrés Viña, an author of the paper, says this reforestation is probably shifting deforestation elsewhere.

""They implemented two national programs. One was the Grain to Green program, which is basically to reconvert agricultural fields in steep slopes into forests. And the other is the natural forest conservation program which is, in a sense, a logging ban to prevent deforestation and also to increase the aerial forests,” Viña says. “At regional scales, in the Sichuan province, the program seems to be working in the sense that there is forest regeneration, forest recovery. And so we wanted to see if that was the case on a national scale. And we also wanted to see if the program was, in fact, related with this regeneration.”

China’s conservation policies banned logging and employed locals as park rangers, protecting forests so that they could regrow. The recovery of a forest in the Min Mountains, Sichuan Province, is pictured here. (Photo: Andrés Viña)

China's reforestation initiatives, in other words, have been a huge success. But Viña says this isn't necessarily a good thing. China, as it turns out, is just looking elsewhere to get the lumber products it needs.

“China has become one of the leading timber importers in the world,” Viña says. “It's Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Indonesia, as well as Africa, northern Eurasia, Russia are the ones that are now supplying all the gap that has been left by this program enacted. In a sense, the program exported the deforestation, and we basically also speculate that it's not just a climate issue, but also a biodiversity issue, because many of the places that are being deforested right now are also places of high biodiversity. We are replacing high biodiversity places in other places for relatively poor biodiversity forests in China.”

Satellites tracked forest cover and regrowth from 2000-2010 in the study, “Effects of conservation policy on China’s forest recovery,” published in Science Advances. (Photo: Viña et al. Sci. Adv. 2016)

“We as consumers with user consumption habits and user consumption rates basically encourage China to participate in things like sustainable timber production certification. A lot of that timber that is imported is used to produce furniture, for example. But then is exported again to countries like the US and countries in Europe, etc. So, indirectly, we are contributing to this export of deforestation. ... What we do in one place will have repercussions beyond that particular place,” Viña says. “Thinking of China as a vacuum, it's a win for China, but how much a reality in terms of climate change mitigation this program is accruing is still a question mark.”

1453,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Who should bear the financial risk of flooding? Report lays out three options - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/who-should-bear-the-financial-risk-of-flooding-report-lays-out-three-options-1.4471632,"OTTAWA -- The federal government could help mitigate the cost of flood damage by creating a ""high-risk"" insurance pool to help lift the burden off the public purse, says a report released Tuesday by the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

The high-risk scheme is one of three options laid out in the report, a product of months of work by a national working group co-chaired by the bureau and Public Safety Canada.

About one-fifth of homes in Canada are considered to be at risk of overland flooding, but many don't have coverage for the damage. For those that do, insurance payouts have surged to about $1 billion per year over the past six years, based on estimates in the report.

Meanwhile, federal payouts to help communities recover from flood damage have quadrupled over the last four decades to about $3.7 billion during the first four years of this decade, compared with just $300 million during the 1970s.

""Taxpayers cannot continue bailing out people who live on floodplains,"" said Craig Stewart, a vice president at IBC and co-chair of the working group.

The three options laid out in the report include a pure market approach where risk is solely borne by homeowners, another where the government is more involved, and finally the creation of a high-risk pool of funds to help manage the financial risk.

The report suggested the high-risk scheme fares better than others at being affordable for homeowners, efficient at payouts, and accessible to homeowners -- but the report stops short of making a recommendation on which option the country should follow.

The advantage of the high-risk scheme is that it allows insurers to pass on risks to a larger pool of available money fed by premiums from homeowners. If a homeowner makes a claim, the insurance company would pay out to the customer and then seek reimbursement from the pool.

Homeowners might not even know they're in the high-risk pool, Stewart said, but it would allow insurance companies to avoid some of the financial risk involved with insuring people whose homes may be flooded.

Premium costs would be based on the risk of flooding, Stewart said. If premiums are capped, the pool would need another source of money to make up the loss, he said, suggesting property taxes or insurance premiums might be options for both that stream of money and the pool's startup costs.

Over time, the high-risk pool would no longer be necessary as homeowners do more to protect their properties, decreasing the risk of damage and insurance payouts. The U.K. took a similar approach in 2016 and projects its high-risk pool will no longer be needed after 25 years.

""For that to happen,"" Stewart said, ""you need to have significant government investment in mitigation over those 25 years.""

While the federal government has promised $2 billion for disaster preparedness, the report noted ""ongoing funding"" is needed, without putting a dollar figure to it. Stewart said the IBC is working with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to figure out the cost to make Canada resilient to flooding, as well as other natural disasters.

More money from the government is one of several key factors the report says are needed to address flood risk.

Another is the possibility of moving people out of high-risk flood zones by paying them to relocate, the report said.

More immediately, improving the quality of data, such as mapping flood risk zones, is ""the single greatest thing the federal government can do,"" Stewart said.

Better mapping is essential to help homeowners take action because many don't even know they live in high-risk flood zones, said Jason Thistlethwaite, an associate director of Partners for Action, a research network committed to reducing flood risk.

""If you are trying to encourage demand for this product, you first need to convince people that they need it,"" he said.

Solving issues like the lack of flood mapping data, poor public awareness and insufficient investment in risk mitigation are essential ""preconditions"" to creating a viable flood insurance system, said Thistlethwaite, who is also a professor at the University of Waterloo.

""It doesn't matter what type of flood insurance model you have -- unless you have the right conditions in place, it isn't going to work,"" he said, adding that first and foremost means more aggressive investment and leadership from the federal government.

""The report is on flood insurance, but it's actually the government that needs to do most of the heavy lifting.""",2019-06-18 07:00:00+00:00,"['federal', 'report', 'flooding', 'bear', 'homeowners', 'risk', 'financial', 'stewart', 'highrisk', 'flood', 'lays', 'help', 'options', 'insurance', 'pool']",Canada,news article,English

51,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Hazelnuts shortfall forces buyers to shell out 60% more for supplies - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/13/hazelnuts-shortfall-price-rise-harvest-turkey,"Chocolate makers already choking on the rising price of cocoa face another price crunch in commodity markets after warnings of a global shortage of hazelnuts.

The price of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60% this year to a 10-year high after bad weather devastated crops in Turkey, the world's biggest producer.

One Scottish manufacturer that sells bags of mixed nuts has already decided to take hazelnuts out of the pack, according to an industry source.

About 70% of the world's hazelnuts are grown on steep slopes near Turkey's Black Sea coast, but this year's harvest is likely to be sharply down after hail storms and frost in late March destroyed hazel flowers at a critical moment in the growing season.

The price of the nuts has reached $10,500 (£6,300) per tonne, compared with $6,500 (£3,900) per tonne in February, according to Michael Stevens, a trader at Edinburgh-based Freeworld Trading.

The full extent of the damage is not yet clear, but the Turkish industry is braced for a harvest that could be down to 540,000 tonnes, against pre-frost expectations of up to 800,000 tonnes.

It comes as food companies also face rocketing prices for almonds, cocoa and coffee – a potential nightmare for those who enjoy a Ferrero Rocher with their after-dinner coffee.

The hazelnut price rise will be particularly tough for buyers at some of the world's biggest confectionery companies, such as Cadbury, whose Whole Nut bar – made with hazelnuts – is one of its bestsellers.

A spokesman for the American conglomerate Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment on whether it would increase the price of its chocolate bars. Mondelez is the name of the snack company spun off by America's Kraft, which completed a controversial takeover of the British chocolate maker in 2010.

Ferrero, the Piedmont-based company that makes Ferrero Rocher and Nutella, the cocoa and hazelnut spread, will also be watching the market closely. Ferrero is the world's biggest buyer of hazelnuts, using 25% of the world's supply and making 180m kg of the spread every year, according to the Italian Trade Agency.

But the company could be insulated from the latest price moves following its recent purchase of Turkey's largest hazelnut processor, Oltan.

The deal to purchase Oltan, which has eight factories shelling, chopping and roasting nuts, is reported to have unsettled other confectioners, which are uncomfortable that one of their suppliers has fallen into the hands of a rival.

Meanwhile, almond prices are at a nine-year high, because of drought in California, the world's biggest grower, while a prolonged dry spell in Brazil in January and February reduced the coffee harvest, pushing up prices.

Not all the current price moves in food commodities are due to unseasonal weather. The price of cocoa has been driven to a three-year high with consumers in China and India getting a taste for chocolate.

The hazelnut price surge has left market players reeling. ""Buyers are living hand to mouth,"" said Stevens. ""Some people had contracts already [pre-dating the frost] and they are not going to get them. A lot of people are still uncovered in the market and people that thought they were covered are now in the market again.""",2014-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['forces', 'hazelnuts', 'nuts', 'supplies', 'shortfall', 'buyers', 'biggest', 'market', 'shell', 'worlds', 'price', 'harvest', 'high', '60', 'cocoa', 'hazelnut']",China,news article,English
377,DR-2021-000022-AFG,'The country could fall apart': drought and despair in Afghanistan - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/25/country-could-fall-apart-drought-despair-afghanistan,"Shafiqa watches closely over her six-month-old niece. Lying on a bundle of fabric, Maryam’s legs jut out, thin and pale. When they arrived at hospital two weeks ago, she could hardly breathe. Her body was swollen with malnutrition, her lips and fingers were blue.

There are 24 children being treated at Mofleh paediatric hospital’s malnutrition ward, on the outskirts of Herat city, western Afghanistan. Mothers and aunts lean next to hospital beds, some rocking tiny babies back and forth.

The worst drought in a decade, prolonged conflict and poverty have pushed families across Afghanistan to the brink. About 13.5 million people are severely food insecure – 6 million more than in 2017. This means they are surviving, for the time being, on less than one meal a day.

“That’s the highest number of any country in the world except Yemen,” says Toby Lanzer, the UN’s deputy special representative in Afghanistan. An estimated 3.6 million people are one step from famine. Flash flooding in many areas has compounded the misery families are facing.

As US and Afghan Taliban peace talks continue, and the prospect of US troops withdrawing looms, the UN’s appeal to donors – which set a target of $612m (£465m) for this year – is only 11% funded.

Without donor support, Afghanistan would face “a humanitarian tragedy beyond what one could describe”, warns Adele Khodr, Afghanistan’s Unicef representative; the country, she says, could fall apart: “It will become a chaotic situation that can generate insecurity not only for here but maybe elsewhere.”

Outside Mofleh hospital, tents stretch into the distance. It’s one of several areas where families who fled the drought have sought shelter. Some sleep in white tents handed out by the UN, others have propped up flimsy pieces of cloth on sticks.

Critics say the response to the drought was slow and failed to support people to stay in their home areas. Alarm bells were first rung by several agencies on the ground, including World Vision, in autumn 2017, but it wasn’t until April 2018 that the government declared a drought. About 260,000 people were forced to leave their homes across northern and western Afghanistan.

New arrivals, whose presence in Herat is politically sensitive, are scattered across several sites, making it harder for agencies to provide services. Access to drought-affected areas, where millions more remain, is hampered by insecurity and lack of funding.

Rahima Lakzai and her family left their village in the Muqur district of Badghis province four months ago. Almost all their animals had wasted away. There was no money for transport; for eight days, they travelled with two donkeys across the rugged terrain that leads to Herat.

Sitting in a small mobile health clinic, run by World Vision, Lakzai, 22, cradles her youngest daughter. Rakima, 11 months, is wrapped in a red cardigan, a matching scarf tied under her chin. A measurement of her arm circumference – just 11.2cm – indicates she has developed severe acute malnutrition. Rahima is given peanut paste to feed to her daughter, and asked to come back in a week’s time.

She says through an interpreter that the family still haven’t been given a proper tent to sleep in and can barely afford food for their two children. Her husband will do any daily labour he can, she says, but there’s little work going.

Torpikae, 35, from Badghis province, lost all 50 of her sheep and three cows in the drought before she fled with her family. “Only a few people remain,” she says. She has received cash handouts, but debt to neighbours means she is not able to keep everything she receives. “Half we give to those [neighbours] we borrowed from,” she says. Like Rahima’s family, Torpikae’s husband goes out to look for work in the city. “Mostly he is jobless,” she says.

Herat is one of Afghanistan’s most prosperous and safe cities, but competition for daily labour, which pays up to $5 a day, is tough. Food is abundant in markets, but numerous families – both locals and people who have fled the drought – can’t afford it.

Shafiqa is from Herat province’s Shindand district, an area that has been racked by violence. Maryam’s mother died two days after giving birth, leaving her in Shafiqa’s care. The family has no stable source of income because Shafiqa’s husband is not well enough to work. Before bringing Maryam to hospital, she depended on neighbours for handouts, she says: “I went from house to house to ask for milk.”

The effects of malnutrition for children aged two and under are irreversible, says Dr Shakib Popal, of World Vision Afghanistan, which supports the hospital’s malnutrition ward. “The brain of the child will be affected and all the consequences will remain for a lifetime,” he says.

Babies often need to stay in the ward for 45 days, adds Popal, but mothers struggle to say away from their families for so long.

“I am begging them to discharge me,” says the woman whose baby is next to Shafiqa. Her three-month-old still has swollen legs, but she has eight other children at home.

Families who have been displaced face the greatest barriers to healthcare: on top of discrimination against new arrivals, many are often too preoccupied with finding shelter and food to go for checkups.

It was six weeks before Torpikae was given a proper tent. In other areas of Herat, and across eight other provinces including Farah and Kandahar, flash flooding has swept away the shelters used by displaced families. “Some 15,000 families, many of them already affected by the drought, were hit by flash floods, and WFP and partners are responding to cover their immediate food and other needs,” says Zlatan Milisic, country director of the UN World Food Programme in Afghanistan.

Lanzer says that acknowledging and responding to slow onset natural disasters such as droughts typically takes time. Whether or not the response was slow is difficult to judge, and irrelevant, he says. “It’s a bit like counting the number of dead people after an earthquake. It doesn’t matter. We deal with the survivors.

“For the past nine months we’ve been doing everything we can with woefully limited resources to do as much as possible,” he says, adding that 5.4 million people were reached with food aid last year. While conditions for displaced families are dire, there are millions more who remain in drought-affected areas.

The effects of the drought are expected to wane. But land degradation – driven by decades of conflict, overuse of natural resources, and climate change – means the full benefits of recent rains aren’t felt. Instead, the risk of flash floods is heightened.

“When forests and rangelands are degraded, topsoil erodes. Any loss of plants and the soil they hold in place means that when rains come, the land doesn’t benefit as much as it should,” says Rajendra Aryal, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s representative in Afghanistan, which is working with the ministry of agriculture, irrigation and livestock to restore forests and rangelands.

Over the past decade and a half, droughts have become more frequent and more serious. It’s likely this trend will continue, creating food crises, prompting large numbers of people to flee their homes, and increasing the risk that water conflict will exacerbate existing ethnic tensions.

Many of those who have fled to Herat do not want to return home. “Even if this year is a good year [for rains] we do not have resources there,” says Rahima.

Shafiqa will stay in the hospital for another two weeks, before she goes back to her children in Shindand. “I have heard from others that the government is going to make peace with the Taliban,” she says. “I hope peace comes to my district.”

Shafiqa says her children are used to the fighting. “We have a shelter underground we go to … once, we were in it for a whole night. When they hear the firing sound, they just come and stick to me.”",2019-03-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['malnutrition', 'apart', 'food', 'hospital', 'family', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'despair', 'fall', 'country', 'families', 'world', 'children', 'herat']",Afghanistan,news article,English

The world delayed a response, knowing that people were dying. Aid agencies like Concern did everything we could to secure funding and reach families forced to make unimaginable choices about which child would live as food and water disappeared.

Parents told us of the choices they made as they walked for days to reach assistance, leaving the weakest children behind.

Over 260,000 people died – a conservative estimate.

In contrast, the 2017 drought in Somalia was adequately resourced, and the response was swift. When action is taken early, lives are saved.

Today, however, 34 million people across the globe are at risk of famine.

Donors are being asked to step up again to save lives and livelihoods so that people not only survive but keep their assets, stay in their homes and recover and rebuild.

Waiting for that famine alarm bell in order to respond means thousands are already dead. – Yours, etc,

1554,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Mother Nature chimes in as officials ponder controversial landfill proposal - ncpolicywatch.com,http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2020/11/13/mother-nature-chimes-in-as-officials-ponder-controversial-landfill-proposal/,"A day of dangerous flooding underscores concerns of local residents regarding proposed Vance County facility

The rain, curtains of it, had fallen in North Carolina all of Thursday. Relentless and unforgiving, floodwaters filled rivers and creeks, which broke their banks. It swept mud from hillsides, buckled roads, swallowed cars. It killed people in several counties.

For residents of Egypt Mountain Road in Kittrell, in rural Vance County, the flooding was an unspoken expert witness in their fight against a Land Clearing and Inert Debris Landfill proposed for their neighborhood.

Late Thursday afternoon, the Vance County Board of Adjustment heard more testimony about the potential environmental impacts of the LCID, as these landfills are known. LCIDs accept tons upon tons of trees, stumps, brush, unpainted wood and concrete, often from construction sites. If the board grants a conditional use permit, this LCID would be built within a half-mile of 60 homes, on roughly 80 acres of steep, rugged and forested terrain that bottoms out at Long Creek, a tributary to Tabbs Creek and the Tar River.

Two months ago, Kenneth Harrison III of K&K Organics, and his attorney, Tom Terrell, had deployed a battalion of expert witnesses — traffic engineers, real estate appraisers, landfill consultants — to testify in hopes of convincing the board to approve the plan. The residents were caught off-guard by the proceedings, which are quasi-judicial in nature and include sworn testimony, similar to a court. The board gave the residents 60 days to hire their own attorney and gather their own expert witnesses, which coincidentally included the flood.

Jeff Garrett lives with his wife Angie on 170 acres that have been in the family for five generations. His mother’s ashes are scattered on the farm, which abuts the property where the LCID would be built. “The creek floods five to 10 times a year,” Garrett said. “And five of those times it’s a major flood.”

The slopes on the proposed landfill acreage are steep, a 70-foot drop in some places. “You’re talking about a lot of water,” Garrett said, comparing the force to “throwing a bowling ball from the top of a hill.”

“How in the world will you build a containment that will hold that water before it gets to the creek?” he added. “There’s a place for these sites, a place far from water.”

John Alderman, a retired biologist with the state Wildlife Resource Commission, discovered freshwater mussels in Tabbs Creek more than 30 years ago— about 350 million years after they emerged from primordial soup. “They watched the dinosaurs come and go,” Alderman said. “The waters were filled with these creatures. Now 80% of the species have been wiped out.”

Both endangered and threatened species of mussels live in Long and Tabbs creeks. Birds, fish and mammals eat mussels, which are also vital to maintaining water quality by filtering out pollutants.

Alderman now works as a consultant to industry, including developers of megasites. “I tell my clients, ‘Put your site where there will be the least damage, the least impact. Be careful. These creatures are going extinct on our watch.'”

Terrell asked Alderman if he “had any evidence” that the LCID would be improperly designed and maintained.

“These designs aren’t made for major rain events,” Alderman replied. “It is not the engineers’ fault. These are 500-, 1,000-year storm events. Whatever is approved can be washed out.”

Terrell has a reputation for being an aggressive, at times even rude litigator. His line of attack was to question the opponents’ witnesses if they had “evidence” that environmental laws would not be followed or enforced.

While it’s impossible to speculate on this particular project, Jill Howell, the Tar-Pamlico Riverkeeper said, the fact that Harrison had already broken environmental laws by illegally dumping on the property without a permit shows “bad faith.”

In addition, the NC Department of Environmental Quality is so short-staffed and underfunded that its enforcement and inspections have suffered. The agency has lost a third of its funding and more than 370 employees in the past 10 years, and, stretched thin, inspectors can visit landfills only once a year, sometimes less frequently. For example, after notifying the agency of illegal clearing along a stream in eastern North Carolina, Howell said, it took two weeks for inspectors to visit the area. Two months later, dirt was still flowing into the waterway. A year later, the site still hasn’t been restored, she said.

Sedimentation and erosion are the least glamorous aspects of environmental protection, but controlling the flow of dirt is essential. When sediment accumulates in rivers and creeks, it clogs fish gills, blocks light, and carries pollutants from the land. It consumes space where water would otherwise go, and worsens flooding. If the land is cleared for the LCID, the trees and vegetation that currently hold the dirt in place and control flood waters will be gone, leaving exposed hillsides that would turn to mud.

“LCIDs can have minimum impacts if sited correctly,” said Howell, who has a master’s degree from Yale University in environmental management. “Flat topography, distance to water and homes. This is site is far from ideal. It poses unreasonable risks to Long and Tabb creeks and the Tar River.”

Former legislator and U.S. attorney, ex-state Treasurer and now a bank president, Richard Moore lives on Egypt Mountain Road about four miles from the proposed LCID site. “This thing is going to be humming wide open,” Moore said, adding that he’s concerned not only about traffic, but about invasive beetles riding in on the trucks filled with brush and trees. From there, the insects can spread and decimate forests. “I’m scared for my timber.”

Kittrell, Moore noted, was the first resort in North Carolina, known for its natural springs. The water table is high, gurgling just below the surface.

“The aquifers in this area are really special,” Moore said. “Water is everywhere.”

As the meeting ended Thursday evening, downstream the Tar River kept rising. In Tarboro, it’s projected to crest tomorrow at nearly 32 feet, major flood stage.

Gleason, 35, suffers from ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which has been found to affect former NFL players at a higher rate and at younger ages.

Gleason underwent treatment in the emergency room at Ochsner Hospital. His wife reported through the Saints that Gleason is alert and 'doing well.'

Unresponsive: Former Saints safety Steve Gleason was taken to a New Orleans hospital after becoming unresponsive

In early 2011, Gleason was diagnosed with ALS. The terminal condition causes gradual paralysis.

Gleason, once a fearless special teams standout who never shied away from bone-rattling collisions with players much bigger than him, now gets around on a motorized wheel chair.

584,Drought Sri Lanka,Horn of Africa: Millions suffering due to prolonged drought - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2019/3/24/horn-of-africa-millions-suffering-due-to-prolonged-drought,"Dire Dawa, Ethiopia – Millions of people in the Horn of Africa are suffering from a prolonged drought that is coinciding with the United States‘s proposal to slash funding for lifesaving food aid.

Earlier this month, the White House, in the 2020 fiscal year budget submitted to Congress, called for a 24-percent cut in US foreign assistance.

Recently released data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSN) predicts worsening drought, severe hunger and crop failures of up to 30 percent in parts of the region in the coming months.

“We’re very concerned by the deteriorating conditions in the region where we are seeing families – whose lives rely on the land – unable to cope,” said Matt Davis, the East Africa regional director for Catholic Relief Services, which oversees a major US government-funded food assistance programme in the region.

“We are concerned the administration’s budget could abandon millions of families around the world just when they need help the most.”

Climate change is also dramatically impacting crop yields in some of the poorest areas of the world.

The number of extreme climate-related disasters including severe heat, droughts, floods and storms has doubled since 1990, according to The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report released by the United Nations last year.

These disasters destroy crops, resulting in tragic consequences for people who live off the land. In the Horn of Africa, up to 80 percent of the population is subsistence farmers.

“We have not seen an improvement in the climate situation,” said Birhan, a mother of four from rural Hawzen district in Ethiopia’s Tigray region.

“The drought is becoming recurrent. But if there is rain, it is excessive and destroys the crops.”

Birhan is one of around 1.5 million people who receive food through a USAID-funded programme that provides emergency assistance to people affected by the drought.

“Without this assistance, our only chance would be to migrate. I don’t even know where I would go,” she said.

To make matters worse, rainfall from October to December of last year was 55 percent less than normal in some parts of the Horn. As a result, widespread hunger is expected to increase in the coming months.",2019-03-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['prolonged', 'world', 'horn', 'suffering', 'millions', 'assistance', 'drought', 'food', 'region', 'united', 'severe', 'africa', 'released']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Under the noonday sun, Alimatu Alidu uses a stone to grind tomato, red pepper, and small crayfish into a red paste. Drops of sweat collect on her forehead, just below her black headscarf. She adds the paste along with other ingredients into a cooking pot balanced upon a make-shift stove, consisting of two uneven rocks with a small fire burning between them. Once her mixture is sufficiently heated, she adds the final element: boiled cowpea beans. Known as poor people’s meat, these faded yellow legumes with a big black dot along the curve are ubiquitous throughout West Africa, including here in Ghana. Other days, Alidu prepares cowpea fritters, or koose, whipping ground cowpea and water into a batter, adding spices, then frying individually rolled balls to be served for breakfast. She can make five different dishes from cowpea beans, which grow in green pods that are up to 12 inches long. Soon the spicy dish, known as red-red, is fully cooked and ready for Alidu’s 16-person family, which includes herself, her husband, their six children, and her husband’s second wife and their seven children. Together, they live in thatch huts that surround this open-air kitchen in the northern village of Zinindo.

Cowpea is a staple in Ghana and other parts of West Africa, where it is believed to have first been domesticated. The legume is a favorite among farmers and laborers, who consume it in the morning before leaving for work and don’t feel hungry until sundown. At her doctor’s request, Alidu increased her own consumption when she was pregnant, and she used the ground seeds to wean her children. Cowpea is a mainstay of school lunches in Ghana. Because the crop can be harvested within two months of sowing, it fills the “hunger gap” for poor families between May and August when other crops, such as maize, are still young in the field. And cowpea tolerates droughts, which are increasing across sub-Saharan Africa. Every woman in Zinindo keeps some cowpea in her home, says Alidu. But cowpea has been under attack for years. A winged pest, Maruca vitrata, bores into the pods and nibbles away at the seeds, destroying anywhere between 20 and 80% of West Africa’s cowpea crops every year. In response, scientists have genetically modified cowpea plant lines to resist the pest, and advocates for the technology—which involves altering an organism’s DNA in ways that aren’t possible through traditional breeding—believe that genetically modified (GM) cowpea can help feed the fast-growing population on a warming planet. It can also help reduce the use of pesticides, they say, freeing up land for other uses, providing enough surplus for regional market opportunities, and giving farmers an additional choice about what to grow. Ghana plans to release GM cowpea sometime this year or next, which would make it the third sub-Saharan African country, after South Africa and Nigeria, to approve the local production and sale of GM food.

advertisement

What worries some critics is that all of Africa’s genetic-modification projects are closely tied to Western organizations. Licenses for the patented genes that African scientists use to modify cowpea crops, for example, were provided royalty-free by biotech companies such as Monsanto (since acquired by Bayer)—inviting questions about whether their goals are purely humanitarian. Further, social scientists warn that GM seeds are being pushed by international donors without fully taking into account the agriculture practices of poor farmers and the specific crop characteristics that they most want and need. While some African scientists are working tirelessly to reassure laypeople that GM foods are safe, it’s clear that safety concerns, however unfounded, are not the only challenge standing in the way of GM cowpea in Ghana. Here in this rural village, Alidu and other poor farmers have not been following these controversies. But they say they are open to new approaches that would minimize pests, allowing them to grow enough cowpea to feed their families with a surplus to sell. In the wake of outcry, an effort to restore their public image The roots of GM cowpea date back to the 1990s, when the Rockefeller Foundation, a New York-based philanthropy, entered into a series of conversations with companies that own many of the genes used to modify food, including Monsanto, DuPont, and Syngenta. Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation believed that biotechnology could help poor countries grow more food. But they understood the companies were unlikely to invest in genetically modifying so-called orphan crops such as cowpea, cooking banana, and cassava, which aren’t traded internationally and are often grown and eaten by farmers without the financial means to purchase expensive GM seeds.

advertisement

Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation proposed that the companies donate the genes to research institutes in developing countries. Researchers at those institutes would then use the genes to develop seeds for orphan crops that could resist pests, tolerate drought and excess salt, and enhance nutrition. A humanitarian organization would be created specifically to facilitate a partnership between the companies, philanthropic and governmental organizations, and the local scientists. The companies initially rejected the proposal, but ultimately accepted the plan after internal discussions about how the partnership could restore their public image. Across the globe, the anti-GM movement had accused the biotech industry of monopolizing the world’s seed supply. Amid this and other criticisms, the companies agreed to an alliance. But they had conditions. The biotech companies wanted Asia and Latin America “off the table” because business was thriving in these regions. The companies also wanted strict licensing contracts that specified where, when, and to whom they would make the genes available royalty-free. These historical details were published in a paper by University of Minnesota sociologist Rachel Schurman, who had interviewed employees of the Rockefeller Foundation, biotech companies, and scientists in Africa.

advertisement

The Rockefeller Foundation agreed to these terms and soon found an additional partner—the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which at that time was also trying to forge partnerships between U.S. universities, biotech companies, and research institutions in developing countries to increase the global acceptance of biotech products. USAID representatives say that their agency promotes biotechnology when conventional breeding is too slow or ineffective to improve a given crop. Over time, other big donors such as UK Aid, and corporations such as PepsiCo, joined the coalition. These groups reached out to African scientists, many of whom believe that biotechnology can solve some of African agriculture’s problems. In 2004, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation was launched. This Nairobi-based nonprofit now coordinates many of the GM research projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Two years later, it formed the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB), an advocacy arm tasked with changing the public’s negative perception of GM products. Today, with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, OFAB organizes meetings between scientists, farmers, and the media. In Ghana, supporters of GM cowpea welcome Western support and believe the international partnerships serve the interests of local farmers. Anti-GM groups, however, don’t trust the companies or their technology. “There is no free lunch,” says Edwin Kweku Andoh Baffour, a spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, the most active anti-GM group in the country.

For now, OFAB appears to be making inroads. A number of Ghanian journalists said that after attending its workshops, they felt better equipped to address misconceptions. For example, doctored images of animal-shaped fruits—supposedly created by inserting animal genes into fruit seeds—had been making the rounds on social media. “More scientists are coming forward to change public perception,” says Joseph Opoku Gakpo, an Accra-based journalist who has attended GM workshops. A mother’s skepticism One day in January, Alidu joins a small group in a prayer led by an old man under a grass-thatched shed near her house. After the prayer is finished, the old man introduces Mohammed Adams Nashiru, head of a farmers’ group in the region. Ghanian scientists have improved cowpea to fight off one of its pests, explains Nashiru. This could benefit local farmers, some of whom see half their cowpea destroyed by field pests in a given year. With this new cowpea, farmers will be able to grow more using less insecticide.

Alidu is skeptical. For one, she and some of Zinindo’s farmers already intercrop cowpea, which lessens pest infestation. Further, though the farmers’ group leader assures the group that the seeds will be available soon, he is one of many government officials, traders, and researchers who have visited the village with promises to improve farmers’ lives. According to Alidu, none of them have ever returned. In stark contrast to his work today, roughly three years ago, Nashiru was leading marches in northern Ghana against GM crops. He says he had a change of heart in 2014 at an OFAB workshop where Walter Sandow Alhassan—former head of Ghana’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research—told an audience of farmers and journalists that GM food has been rigorously tested and is safe to eat. People in the United States, he noted, have been eating genetically modified food for many years. “He said that nothing happened to them,” says Nashiru. “There is no need to worry.” Two years later, a report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that there is “no substantiated evidence” that GM crops are less safe than non-GM crops.

advertisement

Although scientists and the OFAB are working to get that message out—with some scientists even asking their pastors to let them speak about GM food after Sunday prayers—changing public perception “is extremely challenging,” says Vivian Oduro, a plant scientist with the Biotechnology and Nuclear Agriculture Research Institute in Accra. In Ghana, the debate around GM food is highly polarized, as it is elsewhere in the world, even in the U.S., where resistance has paralleled a growing demand for organic foods and clear labeling of genetically modified products. “This is a very connected movement,” says Mark Lynas, a former anti-GM activist turned science writer. “I often see European and U.S. themes quickly picked up by anti-GM activists in Africa.” But Lynas also notes that as people are exposed to a wider variety of facts and opinions—beyond the simple anti-GM narrative—their own views tend to become less entrenched. Many now say they don’t know enough about the technology to be for or against it. Oduro remembers a debate organized by a government ministry in Accra last year, where the audience was asked to vote on the introduction of GM foods. After Oduro explained the science of genetic modification, a different speaker quoted a controversial 2012 study by French scientist Gilles-Éric Séralini. The study showed Séralini’s lab rats developed cancer after eating GM corn. (The paper was retracted the following year after a review found that “the conclusions described in the article were unreliable.”) The speaker also announced that waakye, a popular cowpea delicacy slow-cooked with rice, would be made using that same technology.

advertisement

That made Oduro furious. In her next turn to speak, she appealed to the audience as a fellow Ghanian and as the daughter of a farmer. She and her family eat cowpea, she said. Why would she promote something she believed to be harmful? In fact, experiments show that GM cowpea is not just safe, it also yields about .85 tons more per acre than conventional varieties. And although the GM seeds will be about 50% more expensive than conventional seeds, according to one estimate, they will require just two rounds of pesticides, rather than the current five to six. That will cut overall production costs by 5 to 10%. But, says Oduro, once someone has stirred up fear, it is difficult to convince people not to be afraid. That day, the audience voted against genetically modified crops.

A couple days later, the aggregated online news site GhanaWeb posted an article about Oduro’s public statements. In the comments section, somebody called Oduro a “dirty bitch.” Someone else called her a “foolish woman.” Alhassan has even been the target of online death threats. In 2015, an Accra-based newspaper ran an article that quoted him saying genetically modified food is safe. “Shoot alhassan on the throat. IDIOT!” wrote one commenter after the article was posted on GhanaWeb. “Prof. Walter Sandow Alhassan must die now,” wrote another. Baffour, the spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, says that he doesn’t believe studies such as the ones analyzed in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report. He maintains that other studies show GM crops are not safe, because they have “unintended risks,” though when questioned he didn’t explain what those risks might be. And when asked for examples, he was not able to provide any that were published in peer-reviewed journals. According to Baffour, organic food is “natural” and “obviously the future of the world.” Organic food, however, is expensive to grow because it requires more labor and costly herbal insecticides, which farmers like Alidu cannot afford. This is why biotech scientists say it’s best to offer choices and let farmers decide which seeds best meet their needs.

Anti-GM marches have occurred across Ghana, with many of them centered in Accra. But Nashiru characterizes the marches as a “show for media.” When he used to help organize them, he says he would call village farmers, hand them placards they couldn’t read, and pay them for their efforts. The farmers didn’t even know what they were marching for. Interviews with a wide range of Ghanians revealed some reservations about genetically modified foods. Wouldn’t there be something wrong, they wondered, with a crop that even insects won’t eat? Some maintained that the foods looked “too clean,” though few had actually seen these foods. Richard Ampadu-Ameyaw, Ghana coordinator for OFAB, thinks it is best to train leaders like Nashiru, whose community ties and farming background lend him credibility in the eyes of local community members. Yet there are notable differences between Nashiru’s life and the lives of the poor farmers. For one, he has traveled internationally. He also owns 250 acres of land, much more than a farmer like Alidu, who owns just five acres.

ISRO scientists have given the green signal to the engineering model, while the flight model is being assembled in Banglore, IIT-K Registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar said.

Over 62 students and faculty members of the institute worked hard to built ‘Jugnu’ weighing 3 kg, he said.

On being asked about the delay in the project, he said it took some time for the faculty members and students as it was an indigenously built satellite.

“Jugnu is likely to be launched by the end of next month if everything goes according to our plans,” he said.

Even though Rs. 2 crore was sanctioned for developing the satellite, the cost was brought down to a lesser amount as the institute came up with indigenous technique, he said.

The ISRO and IIT-K had signed a MoU to develop the micro satellite in 2008.

The satellite which will be in the space for about a year will be launched with the help of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), he said.

The data received from ‘Jugnu’ will be studied with the help of a tracking system installed at IIT-K and the received pictures and information from it will be used for research purpose.

The satellite will help in gathering information regarding flood, drought and disaster management, he said, adding its control room and ground station both will be at IIT-K.",2011-08-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['students', 'saidthe', 'satellite', 'jugnu', 'institute', 'plans', 'iitk', 'launch', 'received', 'help', 'built', 'nano', 'launched']",China,news article,English
2390,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Exclusive: UK court to reconsider $6.9 billion Brazil dam lawsuit against BHP - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-uk-court-reconsider-6-161427711.html,"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- Despite Beijing’s best efforts, asset bubbles are forming in China.Home prices are soaring, prompting officials to revive the idea of a national property tax. A surge in raw material prices spurred pledges to increase domestic supply, toughen market oversight, and crack down on speculation and hoarding.The rapid gains are challenging the central bank’s ability to restrain inflation without hiking borrowing costs or making a sharp turn in monetary policy -- something the People’s Bank of China has said it will avoid. The risk is the government’s attempts to curb price increases won’t be enough, forcing the central bank’s hand at a vulnerable time for domestic consumption.That would be a shock to the nation’s financial markets, which are pricing in a relatively benign scenario. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen to the lowest level in eight months, while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index is the least volatile since January. The calm contrasts with the rest of the world, where investors are becoming increasingly obsessed with how central banks may react to the threat of an overheating global economy.“How to mitigate the boom in property and commodities without tightening macro policy -- it’s a real challenge for the Chinese government,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.More than 15 months after the pandemic first forced China to cut rates and inject trillions of yuan into the financial system, policy makers in Beijing are -- like many others across the world -- dealing with the aftermath. As the global economic recovery accelerates, some are being forced to act because of inflation: Brazil in March became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Even Iceland hiked a short-term rate in May.Others, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have insisted spikes in prices are only temporary. The PBOC also downplayed inflation worries in its first-quarter monetary report, published shortly after data showed factory prices surged 6.8% in April -- the fastest pace since 2017.What Bloomberg Economists Say...“It will be a challenge for China to contain rising producer prices because few commodities are priced within the country. There’s not much China can do, and even tightening monetary policy will not be able to change the situation,” said David Qu, China economist at Bloomberg Economics.-- Bloomberg Terminal subscribers can access more insight HEREWhile the rapid increase in commodity prices moderated in recent days, a continuation of gains could pressure companies to pass on rising costs to consumers, who are already spending less than expected. Analysts at Huachuang Securities Co. said in a May 9 report that prices of consumer goods, like home appliances and furniture, as well as electric vehicles and food, are rising. Still, there’s little evidence of demand-driven pressures, with core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fairly subdued.The threat of inflation -- coupled with a fragile economy -- tends to be bad news for stocks because of how it erodes corporate profits, and for bonds it reduces the value of future cash flows. Accelerating prices walloped China’s bond market in 2019, and contributed to a steep selloff in stocks in early 2016.In a sign of how seriously that threat is being taken, China’s cabinet said Wednesday more effort needs to be taken to tackle rising commodity prices. A PBOC official said China should allow the yuan to appreciate to offset the impact of rising import prices, according to an article published Friday. The currency is trading near an almost three-year high against the dollar.Imported inflation is a headache for China’s leaders already dealing with risks caused by a surge in capital inflows. In recent years Beijing opened investment channels to allow more funds into its financial system. The goal was to use foreign institutions’ heft to anchor its markets and stabilize its currency, but the record liquidity unleashed by global central banks in the wake of the pandemic is now pressuring prices in China.That’s prompted some strong language from senior officials. Top securities regulator Yi Huiman said in March large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. The same month, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy.Deciding whether recent spikes in prices are temporary or a permanent shift toward sustained inflation is something Chinese policy makers have to grapple with. For now, Beijing’s current approach of jawboning, boosting supply and penalizing speculation appears to be targeted at the former.“It’s still too early to tell if China can contain the surge in producer prices, and if it can’t, whether that will have large-scale impact on consumer prices,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “This inflation is largely imported -- it’s not something that can be solved by the PBOC.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",2021-05-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['bhp', 'inflation', 'global', 'lawsuit', 'court', 'dam', 'brazil', '69', 'uk', 'reconsider', 'billion', 'exclusive', 'central', 'bloomberg', 'china', 'rising', 'prices', 'costs', 'policy', 'banks']",Brazil,news article,English

184,Drought Sri Lanka,Over 709400 people affected by severe drought - Colombo Gazette,https://colombogazette.com/2017/02/14/over-709400-people-affected-by-severe-drought/,"Over 709,400 people have been affected by the severe drought which has affected most parts of the country, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said today.

Gampaha, Monaragala, Kalutara and Trincomalee are among the worst affected areas.

The drought has resulted in farmers suffering without adequate water.

The World Food Program (WFP) said in a country update that Sri Lanka is preparing for serious difficulties this year in terms of food and nutrition insecurity until the main harvest in March/April 2018.

The expected failure of the main harvest (Maha) season in March/April 2017 could be the worst main agricultural season in the last 40 years.

The Ministry of Disaster Management (MoDM) and the External Resources Department of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs have requested drought-related support from WFP, in particular Cash for Work/Food Assistance for Asset Creation.

WFP is deciding on response options while awaiting the Government’s formal request for assistance to the international community.

WFP technical experts led a preliminary drought rapid assessment using WFP modelling. The report was submitted to a sub-Cabinet Ministers meeting on the drought held on 3 January and was pivotal in alerting government and other stakeholders to the severity of the drought.

WFP and the Government will led a joint emergency assessment this month to assess the impact of the drought on household food security and livelihoods.

The Department of Meteorology said that rain is expected in some parts of Sri Lanka this week. (Colombo Gazette)",2017-02-14 08:00:00+00:00,"['ministry', 'worst', 'wfp', 'sri', 'parts', 'drought', 'food', 'affected', 'season', 'main', 'severe', '709400']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
403,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghanistan's Drought Elicits Both Panic & A Wait-and-see Approach - The Media Line,https://themedialine.org/student-journalists/afghanistans-drought-elicits-both-panic-a-wait-and-see-approach/,"While many are suffering, government authorities claim the drought is cyclical and will likely end soon

Large swathes of Afghanistan have for nearly half a year been gripped by drought, forcing more than 130,000 people from their homes in search of food and water, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Some observers are beginning to sound the alarm on what could be a humanitarian catastrophe. Muhammad Omaid, a resident of Kandahar, told The Media Line that people in the region are drinking dirty water out of desperation and getting sick.

However, government officials and NGOs are not yet hitting the panic button. “It is a bit too early to make drastic statements about the drought, although the predictions so far are indeed that it could be worse than those past,” Zlatan Milisic, Afghanistan Director of the United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP), asserted to The Media Line.

He emphasized that the government for the first time in its history has given food to the WFP so the agency can assist with distribution services. Kabul also has appointed farm leaders and other community heads to help inform local growers on how to develop ways of minimizing the impact of the drought in areas controlled by hostile groups.

The government views the farmers, many of whom are educated and own property, as invaluable partners in the current water crisis. They provide government officials with much-needed information about far-flung areas. For example, the government is working with them to prepare seeds that can be planted when more rain is predicted. It is also enlisting the help of UN researchers to develop ways to weather future droughts.

“Afghanistan goes through a continuous cycle of three or four years with white, snow-capped mountains across the country, and three or four years of water shortages,” Hamdullah Amdare, Afghanistan’s acting Deputy Minister of Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock, explained to The Media Line. He added that this cycle could bring more snow and hence more water soon, thereby ending the drought.

“We really need to wait for next year. If it continues then, of course, this could become a big disaster because this year we had limited dry-land agriculture,” Amdare elaborated. He stressed that the severity of the drought, while not yet a year-long, has not been experienced in many years.

“Next we will be focusing more on irrigation, as this is the next big issue.”

Philippe Kropf, OCHA’s public information officer, told The Media Line that most of those who left their homes were from rural areas. “They are now taking up temporary residence in makeshift sites in urban centers.”

According to OCHA’s Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin “many affected families are living on one meal a day, consisting only of bread and water.”

Agencies, Kropf expounded, are presently collecting data on emergency food needs that will give the WFP a better idea of the extent of the drought in different areas of the country. Farmers are acutely feeling the water shortage because this time of year is usually harvest time. But the lack of rain has decimated typical yields.

Other factors are making this drought worse than previous dry spells. Ongoing Afghan anti-terrorism operations have made it harder for government and UN personnel to reach remotes areas most affected by the drought.

As for now, Kandahar resident Omaid believes the government is doing all it can given its limited resources and the breadth of the water shortages. Nevertheless, he concluded, “at this point people are shocked and very worried about how long this drought will last; they are suffering a lot.”

985,Drought Sri Lanka,Vincent's hits from voices of four generations | The Sundaytimes Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,http://www.sundaytimes.lk/121028/magazine/vincents-hits-from-voices-of-four-generations-18069.html,"Vincent’s hits from voices of four generations View(s):

Vincent de Paul Peiris, a gifted singer who rendered his voice to some of the evergreen hits like ‘Siripade Samanala Kanda Pene’ and ‘Bicycale Bicycale’ will return to perform a musical evening at 6.30 pm on Sunday, November 4 at the British School Auditorium, Colombo 8.

The most significant feature of this show is that Vincent will entertain his fans together with his children, grand children and great grand children on the same stage.

‘Siripade’, the musical evening will be performed by Vincent’s son and daughter Illonka, Anil, grand children Peshani, Amalika, Duwaine, Anarkalie, Lakindu, Shenal, Shion and Shioni and great grandchildren Ayani, Senuja, Deandra and Devorah.

The show will be compeered by Vijaya Corea while talented musician Dinesh Subasinghe is to handle the music.

Vincent a singing legend made his first appearance on stage singing in all three languages at a concert organized in aid of the war effort on December 15, 1940. There he had entertained Lord Louis Mountbatten and soldiers with his voice and a solo rendition on the Hawaiian guitar. He then joined then Radio Ceylon in 1949, Vincent was the only person to host two programmes, western and oriental. Vincent’s ability to yodel and sing western classics earned him the moniker ‘The Gay Yodeler’.

With the aim to render original Sri Lankan songs at a time when the identity of Sri Lankan music was being experimented, Vincent opted to become an oriental singer when Radio Ceylon granted him the option of hosting either western or oriental musical programmes.

With last year’s wheat production already reported to be 57 per cent below the five-year average, the 2018 harvest is forecast to be even lower: down from 4.2 million metric tons to 3.5 million metric tons. (OCHA, 25 Apr 2018)

Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could impact agricultural production. (FEWS NET, 4 May 2018)

In the past week, another 120,000 people have arrived in Qala-e-Naw City, Badghis, due to the drought. In Kandahar, assessment teams verified the arrival of 2,800 drought-displaced people from Badghis and Ghor and 1,400 in the district centre of Maiwand, Kandahar. The total displacement due to the drought has reached a total of 275,000 people, exceeding the number of people displaced by conflict in 2018 by 52,000 people. In Qala-e-Naw, partners are ramping up assistance across all sectors and are deploying additional staff, though the gaps remain significant. Further, WFP plans to further scale up food assistance in areas of origin to allow families to return to their villages, reaching up to 100 per cent of the population in the most affected districts. In Hilmand Province, IRC started a new project to assist 2,100 drought affected people. (OCHA 9 Sep 2018)

Badghis, Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Hilmand, Nimroz, Uruzgan, Kubduz, Takhar, Herat, Ghor and Farah are among the worst affected provinces...The government launched a USD 100 million appeal in mid-April through MAIL for immediate livestock protection for an initial two months of assistance for fodder/feed support and an overall demand of USD 550 million for a 10 months fodder / feed support throughout the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. (IFRC, 16 May 2018)

In the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, nearly 15 million people rely on farming, livestock or labour opportunities in agriculture. Of these, an estimated 2 million people will become severely food insecure due to the drought. Humanitarian partners are ramping up their response across the country...trying to reach 1.4 million of the most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men struck by the drought. Partners urgently need $115 million; the majority of this amount will provide food support to help families through the lean season and to provide them with drinking water for six months. (OCHA, 25 May 2018)

The Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) has been revised to to include response to the drought and now calls for $547 million. The additional funding will allow humanitarian partners to incorporate assistance to 1.4 million people mostly affected by the drought..

Food security outcomes in the agropastoral areas are worse than is typical during the spring and summer months. Livestock productivity and body conditions are below normal levels in many areas due to very poor rangeland conditions, leading to low income from livestock sales and limited household availability of livestock products. Most rangeland areas have received well below average rainfall amounts, except for localized parts of western, southwestern, and southeastern provinces. (FEWS NET, 31 May 2018)

Although several significant precipitation events during late spring helped alleviate dryness across the country, late rainfall was not sufficient to mitigate seasonal dryness in many parts of the country, which is most severe in the northwest but also significant across much of the north, northeast, southwest and central provinces. Field reports confirm that area planted for rainfed wheat is less than that of last year due to dry soil conditions and the use of extended areas for grazing, while a significant proportion of planted rainfed areas may have reduced yields due to dryness. (FEWS NET, 6 Jun 2018).

The intense drought between April and September is expected to further aggravate the already poor malnutrition status within the 20 affected provinces, and the impact may extend to December. As a result, an increase in acute malnutrition caseload between July and December 2018 is expected. In addition, the severity of acute malnutrition among children under five may get worse, resulting in cases that are more complicated. As of 19 July, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in magnitude and severity of acute malnutrition and disease will stretch the capacity of health facilities to provide treatment, and that in the medium to long-term, children will face heightened vulnerability to morbidity and mortality. (WHO, 19 Jul 2018).

In Hirat City, Hirat, humanitarian teams identified more than 51,000 people who have recently migrated to the city from drought-affected areas in neighbouring Badghis and Ghor provinces. The families are living in dozens of sites on the outskirts of the cities in makeshift shelters. In Qala-e-Naw, Bagdhis, teams identified nearly 7,000 people who have moved from rural areas to the provincial capital due to the drought. Cash distributions have started for these displaced families. The Government has distributed wheat grain to 15,000 families in four districts of Badghis, and WFP is preparing to distribute 1,250 metric tons of food in two districts of the same province. (OCHA, 23 Jul 2018)

Poor households in the northern areas will be the most affected by the drought due to reduced household wheat stocks and income from on-farm labor where food consumption deficits will continue through the next harvest (Spring 2019). Poor households in central areas of the country dependent on remittances from migrant workers in Iran are expected to see a decrease in remittances and further weakening of the Iranian rial (IRR) against the U.S. Dollar (USD) and Afghani (AFN) to drive low incomes. (FEWS NET, 31 Jul 2018)

As of 6 August, approximately 4,000 people arrived in Qala-e-Naw, Badghis, during the past week, reportedly displaced by drought from Muqur district. In Kunduz Province, more than 10,000 people have reportedly been displaced between different districts due to the drought. (OCHA, 6 Aug 2018)

As of 12 August, some 1,400 families reportedly arrived in the centre of Abkamari district, Badghis, from villages affected by the drought in the district. In Farah City, Farah, assessment teams identified nearly 600 people displaced by the drought from within the province. Further, around 280 displaced people were identified as having been displaced from their villages in Shahrak district, Ghor, due to the drought. In Qala-e-Naw, Badghis, authorities designated a new site for 1,700 families who arrived recently in the city due to the drought. (OCHA, 12 Aug 2018)

The drought continues to force people from their rural homes to the urban centres in Badghis, Ghor and Hirat provinces where their number surpassed 100,000 since May, according to humanitarian partners. The situation of drought-induced IDPs in Hirat city, Hirat remains dire. In the past week, six children reportedly died in the informal sites due to sickness, in a fire accident and at birth. WASH, health and protection services on the sites are picking up, but there are large gaps notably of emergency shelter. DRC-DDG and UNICEF have started protection monitoring on sites housing some 35,000 people. (OCHA, 19 Aug 2018)

An estimated 275,000 people have been displaced as a result of the drought in Afghanistan. Newly displaced people arriving in Hirat during the last week have been reported, but not confirmed. In response to the drought, WFP started food distributions for 47,000 people in rural areas of Ghor Province. (OCHA, 17 Sep 2018)

In the first half of September, an estimated 120,000 people have been displaced from rural areas of Badghis to Qala-e-Naw as a result of drought. As of 20 September, an estimated 253,600 people are currently displaced from drought affected areas across the Western Region. A further 28,000 people displaced by the drought have returned to their homes in Muqur district of Badghis, in the last two weeks, upon assurances of food distributions in their home villages. Existing response capacity at more than a dozen sites in Qala-e-Naw and its surroundings is limited: around 42,000 people have insufficient access to safe drinking water and over 130,000 people have no access to sanitation facilities with people living in makeshift shelters. (OCHA, 24 Sep 2018)

Due to drought, high levels of food assistance needs will persist through the start of the lean season. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and will contribute to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. The worst-affected households will likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter in. (FEWS NET, 30 Sep 2018)

On 16 October, [UN] Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund...and [CERF] have allocated $34.6 million in emergency aid to support 2.2 million people affected by a severe drought. With these funds, 7 national NGOs, 15 international NGOs and 4 UN agencies will distribute food and seeds, maintain primary health services, provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, improve hygiene and sanitation, treat severe malnutrition, and help farmers protect their livestock. (OCHA, 16 Oct 2018)

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and will contribute to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. Poor household dependent on rainfed wheat production, particularly in northern, northeastern, and northwestern areas, are expected to experience difficulty meeting consumption requirements until next year’s spring harvest. The worst-affected households will likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter (IFRC, 1 Nov 2018).

According to the latest IPC report, Badghis is among the three provinces with IPC Phase 4 (emergency), whereas, Ghor, Hirat and Farah provinces are classified as IPC phase 3 (crisis). The most affected provinces with large-scale displacement are Badghis and Hirat provinces which accounts 74% of the total IDPs (OCHA, 19 Nov 2018).

In October-November, WFP reached nearly 1.6 million drought-affected people with food assistance in all 20 affected provinces, providing more than 27,000 mt of food and transferring over US$1.45 million cash assistance to the affected people. Meanwhile, prepositioning of food and nutrition supplies continues in remote areas in nine provinces, to cover the needs of 499,000 people (3,400 metric tons prepositioned in the last week of November). (OCHA, 9 Dec 2018)

During 17 - 23 December, as part of the ongoing full-scale drought response, WFP and its partners reached 104,500 drought-affected people both in rural and urban areas of eight provinces with 720 (mt) of food and US$180,000 in cash transfers to cover food needs. In the first three weeks of December, WFP and partners assisted nearly 450,000 drought-affected people with some 3,750 (mt) of food and US$540,000 in cash transfers. (OCHA, 23 Dec 2018)

As part of the ongoing full-scale drought response, WFP and its partners reached 162,000 drought-affected people both in rural and urban areas of eight provinces during 8 - 14 January 2019. This included food for more than 40,000 people in informal settlements in and around Qalae-Naw in Badghis, who were displaced due to the drought. In total, WFP and partners distributed more than 4,400 metric tons (mt) of food in Badakhshan, Badghis, Ghor, Helmand, Herat, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul and Takhar provinces. (OCHA, 14 Jan 2019)

Afghan Red Crescent Society..conducted an emergency needs assessment in nine drought affected provinces in December 2018 and January 2019. The emergency needs assessment report indicated that the priority needs of the affected population, who are staying in rural areas and IDP camps, are food, water, health care and livelihood support. Almost 60 to 70 per cent of the water points are now dry. Most of the affected communities in province of the country have very low latrine coverage. The water treatment is equally low, at less than 10 per cent. (IFRC, 17 Mar 2019)

As of 31 March, humanitarian partners have reached 4.4 million people affected by drought with support, 91 per cent of those targeted for assistance. Of those reached, 438,600 people are in areas of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. (OCHA, 23 Apr 2019)

Food security outcomes across the country are most likely to continue to gradually improve as the main harvest begins in late May/early June. As a result, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are most likely to emerge. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are also most likely in areas still recovering from the drought with continued conflict preventing access to agricultural activities. (FEWS Net, 31 May 2019)

As of 30 April, humanitarian partners have reached 4.8 million people affected by drought. Of those reached, 405,000 people are in places of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. (OCHA, 29 May 2019)

According to WFP, the drought support is scaling down starting in April, which will transition to seasonal support at the end of June. (WFP, 31 May 2019).

As of 31 May, humanitarian partners have reached 4.9 million people affected by drought. Of those reached, 450,600 people are in places of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. (OCHA, 23 Jun 2019)

Food security outcomes are anticipated to generally improve across the country from June to September 2019, due to the above average wheat harvest, favorable livestock prices, and high demand for agriculture labor during the harvest. Most poor households across the country are likely to face Minimal (IPC Phase 1) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2). Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to continue in displaced households, undocumented returnees and areas of Badghis province which was significantly affected by last year’s drought and conflict. (FEWS Net, 29 Jun 2019)

As of 8 July 2019, the impact of drought has heavily influenced population movement within Afghanistan and caused the displacement of 287,000 people primarily from the north-western and western regions. The sudden influx of over a quarter million people into the outskirts of Herat has led to the emergence of 19 vast and sprawling informal settlements. The food security and livelihoods situation has significantly deteriorated over the past months, driven mostly by the severe drought in 2018. An estimated 13.5 million people are severely food insecure and require emergency assistance. Twenty provinces of Afghanistan are food insecure and identified as having acute humanitarian food needs, health and WASH issues and their livelihoods. (IFRC, 9 July 2019)

Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected to be widespread as a result of the harvest and many households access own foods. However, areas of Badghis where many households are still recovering from the drought, undocumented returnees, and displaced households are expected to continue to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). As winter starts in October/November across much of the country, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are most likely to emerge as many households are expected to rely on markets with below average incomes. (FEWS Net, 31 Jul 2019)

In reviewing the situation, [FAO] stated that the deteriorating food security and livelihood situation has continued into in the latter half of 2019, driven mostly by the worst drought in a decade last year. The severe drought has affected more than two-thirds of the country and destroyed the agriculture sector. Despite reports of good harvests for 2019, FAO predicted that it will not be enough to alleviate food insecurities in the region. (FAO, 16 Sep 2019)

Between August and October 2019, it is estimated that 10.23 million people (33% of the total population) are in severe acute food insecurity and require urgent humanitarian action. These include around 7.79 million people in a crisis situation (IPC Phase 3) and 2.43 million people in an emergency situation (IPC Phase 4). Around 10.37 million people are also in a stressed situation (IPC Phase 2) and require livelihood support. During the projection analysis period, from November 2019 to March 2020, around 11.30 million people (37% of the total population) are estimated to be likely to experience severe acute food insecurity, out of which an estimated 8.6 million people likely be in an emergency situation (IPC Phase 4). Furthermore around 9.45 million people will be in a stressed situation (IPC Phase 2). (IPC, 30 Sep 2019)

Conflict and insecurity continue to disrupt livelihoods across most of the country with over 380,000 people displaced since the start of 2019. Additionally, over 440,000 people have returned from Iran and Pakistan to date in 2019. Most of the returned and internally displaced populations are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) as these households have limited ability to access labor markets. Moreover, poor households impacted by weak labor markets, and below average remittances in higher elevated areas of the country remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). The rest of the country is in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) as many households continue to consume own foods, although have below average incomes. (FEWS Net, 26 Nov 2019)

Reports state that humanitarian food assistance will be necessary through the upcoming winter to mitigate food consumption gaps and prevent malnutrition in Afghanistan, especially as up to 85 percent of the country’s food comes from irrigated farming. It is predicted that, due to the effects of the drought, the number of people experiencing crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity will rise to 14.3 million people between the period of November 2019 and March 2020. This is an increase by 113 percent over the same period a year previous, as per Flowminder 2020 population projections. (OCHA, 20 Dec 2019).

Many millions of people are still reeling from the crippling effects of the 2018-19 drought and struggling to recover. The cumulative impacts of decades of war, combined with recurrent natural disasters and chronic poverty, have resulted in crippling debt and depleted people’s capacity to cope with repeated shocks. Over 14 million people are projected to experience crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity, in the first quarter of 2020. Malnutrition is soaring, with over 3 million children and women acutely malnourished, requiring specialised nutrition supplies and medicines. (OCHA, 7 Jan 2020)

According to the IOM, almost 11,000 undocumented Afghans returned from Iran and Pakistan, and 700 people have been newly displaced by conflict in January 2020. These populations are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity as they have lost their typical livelihood activities and have limited ability to enter the labor markets. Many poor households across the country are facing food consumption gaps as households have depleted their food stocks and face difficulty accessing income to purchase food. Many of these households are in the Central Highlands and Northeastern parts of the country with these areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are present in areas where households have access to remittances or labor opportunities although at below average levels. As winter progresses, more households are expected to rely on markets for food with below average purchasing power. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to emerge across parts of the country.

135,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka hit by worst drought in decades - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/1/22/sri-lanka-hit-by-worst-drought-in-decades,"Dry spell affects more than a million people, with authorities warning of more water shortages.

Sri Lanka is suffering its worst drought in four decades, according to officials, with more than a million people experiencing acute water shortages.

The lack of rain last year has lowered water levels in rivers in parts of the country. With less water available to drain the sea salt, supplies have been contaminated, especially in the town of Kalutara, south of the capital, Colombo.

In the village of Kaluganga, more than 200,000 people are affected, as they lack access to clean drinking water.

With rain not expected for another two to three months, the government is warning of worsening shortages.

Reservoirs in the country are running low and some are now down to a fifth of their capacity.

“This drought is affecting both the agricultural and the hydro-power generation,” Lalith Chandrapala, director general of the meteorological department, told Al Jazeera.

“It is one of the worst droughts since the 1970s.”

Farmers have been badly hit by the dry spell as they have managed to plant only a third of the usual 800,000 hectares of paddy fields – the lowest in 30 years.

There are disturbing signs that up to half of the crops will fail and the next planting season is also in jeopardy.



“All our paddy was destroyed,” said Rabanda, a farmer. “We don’t have a way to survive and now we don’t even have water to drink.”

A task force has been set up by the government to deal with food shortages and rising prices as a result of the drought.",2017-01-22 08:00:00+00:00,"['warning', 'spell', 'million', 'dry', 'rain', 'worst', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'drought', 'hit', 'lack', 'paddy', 'decades']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The 25-year-old has sealed a transfer to the Swedish club after fine performances last season

Swedish club Trelleborgs have announced the acquisition of Asante Kotoko attacker Abdul Safiu Fatawu.

The 25-year-old Ghanaian joins the second-tier side for the remainder of the 2019 season with an option to extend the deal for a further two years.

The switch comes after a move to Swedish elite division fold Helsingborgs fell through due to the inability of the Porcupines and the Reds to reach an agreement over his transfer fee following a training stint with the club.

""We continue to strengthen on the attack side, now by the addition of 25-year-old forward Fatawu Safiu from Ghana,"" Trelleborg announced on their official website on Tuesday.

""The contract is valid for the 2019 season with an option for an additional two years.""

""Fatawu Safiu comes from the club Asante Kotoko in Ghana where he played the 2018-19 season.

""He has also previously represented Ghana's U20 national team.

""We warmly welcome Fatawu to Trelleborgs FF!""

Last season, Fatawu netted 10 times to help Kotoko win the Ghana Special Competition, finishing joint-top scorer in the championship.

The attacker also played an instrumental role as the Porcupines reached the group stage of the Caf Confederation Cup.

His good showing earned him a spot in Ghana's provisional squad for the recent Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt but he fell short of making the final 23-man roster.

""With Fatawu Safiu, we get an experienced and strong striker who can also play in all attack positions,"" Trelleborg boss Peter Swardh said.

""He is creative and should strengthen our offensive qualities.""

Fatawu's transfer situation saw him miss Kotoko's Caf Champions League opener against Nigeria's Kano Pillars on Saturday.

569,Drought Sri Lanka,"Drought worsens lives of 117,000 people across island | The Sunday Times Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190407/news/drought-worsens-lives-of-117000-people-across-island-344009.html,"Drought worsens lives of 117,000 people across island View(s):

More than 117,000 people from 33,775 Sri Lankan families across the island are once again facing the double whammy of debilitating drought and the lack of water for drinking, livestock, and cultivation as of this month.

The numbers of people suffering from the drought has been rising since January.

Many small tanks and reservoirs have dried up despite the reasonable rains during the monsoon, according to the Department of Meteorology.

The worst drought hit regions are Puttalam, Vavuniya, Jaffna, Gampaha, Matara, Polonnaruwa and Kandy.

According to the Disaster Management Center (DMC), some 117,378 people from 33,775 families are suffering.

The Ministry of Disaster Management, via its arm the DMC, has allocated Rs 6.65 million for the affected families. Meanwhile, 300 water tankers and 4,471 water tanks have been distributed across 13 districts, so far.

This came in the wake of a renewed heat index advisory issued by the Department of Meteorology this week forecasting severe heat until April 15.

In Puttalam, 8 of 16 divisions are suffering without water.

Dankotuwa, Aarachchikattuwa, Mundalama, Pallama, Mahawewa, Naththandiya and Nawagathhena divisions have 8,000 — the highest number — affected.

The District Secretary N H M Chitrananda said water collection points have been set up. “We have not begun issuing dry rations, but we are monitoring the conditions.” Mr Chitrananda added the heat wave arrived unusually early.

Puttalam’s coconut yields have also declined. According to the District Secretary, many plantation owners have complained that the heat was to blame.

The Jaffna District Secretary, N Vedanayahan, told the Sunday Times that usually the drought is experienced by the end of April following the Sinhala and Tamil new year festivities.

Neduntivu, Kayts, Delft, Maruthankerni and Karainagar are provided with drinking water points for the people.

“We have taken adequate steps to provide drinking water to the northern islands where it has become a major issue during the drought,” he said. At least 50 non-irrigation category tanks were renovated by the District Secretariat to store rain water for livestock, and farming.

According to Mr Vedanayahan, the department has taken steps to implement an ambitious water project called ‘Aarumugam Plan’ to use rain water stored in the Vadamarachchi lagoon.

Dr Shiromani Jayawardena, the deputy director for Research and Climate Change at the Department of Meteorology, predicts higher temperatures by 2050. She has been studying the weather patterns of Sri Lanka over the years.

“There is no predominant wind now, but a very calm one. The high humidity makes people uncomfortable and they continuously sweat,” said Dr Jayawardena explaining why many feel that their body temperature is higher compared with the environment.

According to Dr Jayawardena’s study of Sri Lanka’s weather patterns over the years, two weather scenarios emerged based on emissions of greenhouse gas. In a moderate emissions scenario, the maximum temperature will increase from 1 to 1.6 degrees Celsius, whereas with high emissions, it would rise from 1.6-2.5 degrees by 2050.

Usually, by the third week of March, thundershowers were likely but it was not to be.

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board issued a notice this week urging the public to use water wisely.

A joint bulletin by the World Food Programme and Ministry of Public Administration and Disaster Management, titled “Climate and Food Security Monitoring,’’ shows that the current reservoir water level is 65%, and that more water is needed for a successful Yala season.

Heat-related risks rise

The Department of Meteorology has issued a severe heat index advisory for the Northwestern Province and the districts of Mannar, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Hambantota and Monaragala, warning that the human body temperature may spike up to 42 centigrade as the sun will be moving directly overhead Sri Lanka until April 15.

The heat is expected to increase from 32-41 centigrade and people are being advised to watch out for heat cramps and heat exhaustion. There is also the risk of heat stroke.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, advised those working outdoors to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade whenever possible.

The elderly and children may suffer bouts of heat exhaustion and should limit strenuous outdoor activities.",2019-04-07 07:00:00+00:00,"['weather', 'tanks', 'week', 'heat', 'water', 'sri', 'temperature', 'drought', 'worsens', 'district', 'lives', 'island', 'department', '117000']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
1608,FL-2020-000164-IND,"West Coast, Central India await heavy rain spell in early July - BusinessLine",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/west-coast-central-india-await-heavy-rain-spell-in-early-july/article31945143.ece,"The West Coast — especially Konkan, Goa and Coastal Karnataka — along with Central India could be the focus of enhanced monsoon activity into early July, normally the rainiest month, even as the first monsoon month of June prepares to sign off with excess rainfall of around 20 per cent, among the best in recent times.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, however, that the hills of North-West India (Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and adjoining plains may continue to witness subdued activity during the next five days though things would change for the better thereafter.

Strong spell for coast

Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is forecast to continue along the West Coast during this period before the proceedings get amplified with raised intensity, precipitating isolated heavy to very heavy falls over Konkan, Goa and Coastal Karnataka as yet another monsoon pulse unfolds.

Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is the call for Central India, with isolated heavy falls being forecast over Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh during these five days and over Vidarbha on July 2 and 3, the IMD said. A similar outlook is valid for East India, thanks to a trough and a cyclonic circulation.

The North-South trough runs down from Norh-East Bihar to North Coastal Odisha, and is topped off by the circulation over East Uttar Pradesh. This combo feeds in huge moisture from the Bay of Bengal and would rain it down heavily over East Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, hills of West Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya.

Truncated monsoon trough

Meanwhile, the crucial monsoon trough running diagonally across North India, the single-most important monsoon feature over North India, ran down on Monday from Amritsar, Ambala, Delhi, Fursatganj, Jehanabad, Dhanbad and Digha before its south-eastern end dipped into the Bay of Bengal.

Its north-western end has to ideally shift further south from South-West to Rajasthan to convert itself to a fully productive channel for low-pressure areas from the Bay to move in and ensure equitable rainfall across and time and space for the farming heartland. This may take a while to happen.

According to the IMD projections, this may be delayed until July 7 when a low-pressure area is expected to form over the Head Bay. It is forecast to move along the monsoon trough across East India initially to Central India, before proceeding to Rajasthan along a more southerly than usual track.

Heavy over Central India

This could bring heavy to very heavy rainfall over Central India, West India and adjoining North-West India, all across the West Coast, Gujarat and South-West Rajasthan by the end of the first week of July. Extended outlook for July 4-6 says fairly widespread to widespread rain/thundershowers with isolated intense to very intense falls for northern parts of the West Coast, North-East India and northern plains.

Scattered rainfall/thundershowers are likely over Central and adjoining East India, Lakshadweep and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands during this period.

Meanwhile, strong winds have been warned over both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the run-up to the emerging new active phase of the monsoon.",2020-06-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['rainfall', 'await', 'early', 'west', 'bay', 'rain', 'east', 'heavy', 'trough', 'pradesh', 'spell', 'central', 'coast', 'india', 'monsoon']",India,news article,English
536,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Pre-drought conditions worsen in many parts of Somalia - Horn Observer,https://hornobserver.com/articles/814/Pre-drought-conditions-worsen-in-many-parts-of-Somalia,"



According to the FAO latest drought update, the worst affected regions include Lower Juba, Middle Juba, Gedo, Mudug, Nuugal, Bari, Toghdheer and Sool which are currently experiencing severe water shortages for domestic, livestock and agricultural production purposes.





Availability of water and pasture conditions have significantly deteriorated, leading to increased livestock migration and rapid rise of water prices. In Puntland, the price of water in most rural villages has doubled since the beginning of March as the dry conditions persist in most rural villages and settlements across the state. By the end of March, a 200-litre barrel of water sold between USD$7 to $9, up from an average of $3 in February 2021.





In a Drought Need Assessment conducted in February by an NGO in Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions, about one-third of communities do not have access to sufficient water, with 88 per cent of water points unable to produce sufficient water for drinking. In Jubaland, 200-liter barrel cost about USD $14 as water pans which were the main source of water in the area dried up. As a result of the ongoing situation, water is trucked from locations 60 kilometers away for communities in Burgabo village in Jubaland.

According to the latest UNICEF humanitarian situation report the water shortages and challenges of getting safe drinking water has contributed to cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) /cholera cases in some areas across the country.







According to Federal Ministry of Health and Human Services, a total of 88 suspected cases of cholera were reported in the last week of February from Bay, Afgoye, Merka and Banadir regions, with no reported deaths. As of 23 March, the cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases in 2021 was 780, including 2 associated deaths with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.3%.

In response to the water crises, both federal and local authorities, and humanitarian partners are providing support in various areas. The humanitarian leadership mobilized $13.3 million from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund and $7 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to facilitate rapid response efforts for populations hardest hit by the water-shortage crisis as well as up to $20 million to activate the Anticipatory Action Framework. Puntland authorities have secured funding to rehabilitate five strategic boreholes with replacement of submersible pump, control panel, pipes, motors and storage tanks.







Once repaired, all five boreholes will serve up to 15,000 people cumulatively thus reducing the pressure on available water access points. In Hiraan region, UNICEF has responded to areas affected by water shortages with water trucking in Belet Weyne, reaching about 18,000 people.







Disease surveillance is being managed with the support from WHO through the the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN) and is currently being expanded to all health facilities across the country.

MOGADISHU (SOMALIA) - In March, large parts of the country faced severe drought conditions, triggered by below average 2020 Deyr rains and above average temperatures during the Jilal season. Over 116,000 Somalis were displaced by water shortages between October 2020 and March 2021.In Lower Shabelle region of South West State, authorities and partners have reported that a 200-litre barrel of water currently costs around $4.5, a 20% increase compared to prices in December 2020.In Middle Shabelle, consequences of water shortages forced about 5,000 farmers among riverine communities in Jowhar and Mahadaay to flee to Mogadishu in search of casual labour to support their families.",2021-04-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['worsen', 'water', 'reported', 'million', 'support', 'regions', 'response', 'conditions', 'parts', 'predrought', 'drought', 'shortages', 'cases', 'humanitarian', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

980,Drought Sri Lanka,Check dam across Cauvery to be ready by end of June - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/check-dam-across-cauvery-to-be-ready-by-end-of-june/article4584193.ece,"PWD pushing ahead to finish work before next irrigation season

With the ground water table depleting rapidly in view of the drought like conditions, Tiruchi Corporation has just begun to dig additional borewells on the river bed. Next summer, it will most likely be spared of the trouble. Just a few metres downstream the place where the borewells are being dug up, men and machines are working at a feverish pace building a check dam that is expected to put an end to the worries of the city water managers caused by the drying of the borewells.

The city’s water sources on the river bed are mostly likely to be surrounded by water retained by the check dam once water is released from Mettur reservoir for the next irrigation season.

Though it dealt a blow to the farmers in the delta, the early end to the irrigation season last year owing to insufficient storage at Mettur dam provided an extended window to the public works authority to expedite the construction of the check dam near Kambarasampettai, just a few metres away from the city’s main water sources.

Work has been in full swing since December after the water dried up in the river. Although the work is scheduled for completion only in February next year, as per the contract, nearly 75 per cent of the work has already been completed.

PWD sources told The Hindu that they were hoping to complete all the works on the river bed by the end of June, before release of water from Mettur the next irrigation season, barring unusual heavy rain during the summer. “We are working towards completing 95 per cent of the project works by the end of June. Effectively, all works on check dam structure on the river bed will have been completed by then, though strengthening of the river bunds on both sides will take a couple of more months,” said a PWD officer.

The check dam was sanctioned at a cost of Rs.32 crore following a public outcry over the heavy exploitation of the river bed for a slew of drinking water schemes catering to the needs of various cities and towns as far as Ramanathapuram. Farmers of the region have been left worried over the drastic fall in water table during the summer months.

The structure will run for a length of 550 metres and stand about 1.5 metres in height from the bed level. It will head up water for a stretch of 1.50 km upstream and provide a continuous wetting of the river bed so as to keep the drinking water collector wells sufficiently recharged, especially in the summer. The check dam will also help recharge ground water table for a radius of about four to five km. Construction of the apron, the cut-off and toe walls has been completed. The body and retaining walls are being built currently. Once this is completed, six sand vents will be built.",2013-04-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['river', 'bed', 'dam', 'works', 'end', 'check', 'summer', 'metres', 'ready', 'cauvery', 'water', 'irrigation']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
120,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Ethiopia: It Is Becoming Ubiquitous – A Boon or Bane? - Geeska Afrika,https://www.geeskaafrika.com/ethiopia-it-is-becoming-ubiquitous-a-boon-or-bane/,"Nairobi (HAN) October 19, 2015 – Public Diplomacy and Regional Investment Initiative News. By Asmamaw Getaneh. The merit and demerit of Khat must be well identified Long back, in Ethiopia, especially in the majority of small towns and in rural parts, chewing Khat was quite strange, and even it was considered as a deviation from normal behavior, culture, norm and social cohesion. Today, the prevailing attitude for the majority turns out to be quite the contrary.

Chewing Khat is spreading fast in almost all urban areas and in some rural localities. The demand for those hypnotic leaves is ever on the rise; it can better be characterized as inelastic—prices of Khat do show insignificant variation in response to the market supply. Consequently, more and more farmers are taking on growing Khat as a basic source of income as the market for it is so lucrative that several farmers are replacing their vegetable gardens with Khat production.

Surprisingly, a quarter of a century ago, chewing Khat used to be taken a perilous addiction, and the market for Khat was limited mostly to certain parts of the country especially in urban areas. Addicts were construed to be more eccentric and irrecoverably possessed by their risky habits of using stimulant substances such as smoking tobacco and chewing of Khat. With a steadily rising demand, the production of Khat can have considerable potentialities to configure the traditional vegetable and fruit cultivation in rural areas wherever this cash crop can grow.

As one of the major cash crops, the contribution of Khat towards national revenue, especially if it is produced on a large scale, is quite promising. From the point of view of production, Khat provides certain better opportunities to growers. In relative terms, the production of Khat requires less water.

Khat grows well in hot climatic regions, and has superb drought resisting capabilities. It also requires less labor and other inputs compared to the production of say vegetables or fruits. Moreover, depending on suitability of soil and climatic conditions, producers can have three or more harvests in one year. This gives Khat growers good opportunities to supplement their incomes, particularly to producers in rural areas where there is lack of irrigation opportunities and thus harvests are limited to once a year.

Again, Khat sells at far better prices than most vegetable products. Khat also gives better yields per unit of farmland. Due to these and other benefits it renders, the production of Khat is slowly but surely exhibiting increasing trends. Provided that current demand is sustained in the long run, the market for qhat will grow more and more lucrative and production is likely to rise.

Nevertheless, there is an existing dilemma towards the burgeoning consumption of Khat and the profitable market thereon. Chewing Khat is a waxing whirlpool which takes a disquieting proportion of the youth in the urban areas the vortex of addiction. Khat often when the rising use of Khat is a topic on the plate, there is a tendency to associate it towards the unemployed youth as a perturbing social dilemma.

The latent assumption is that these groups of youth resort to chewing Khat as an option to pass time and fend off the depressive effects of boredom. Nonetheless, the consumption of Khat is quite widespread within other cross-sections of the society. Foremost among these are university students, teachers, merchants, night shift workers in pubs and nightclubs, and high school students who prepare for exams. With the community of students, consumption of khat exhibits significant seasonal variation, the peak times being exam periods. Chewing khat cannot be as such taken as an option by the unemployed simply because they could not have the money to afford for it. Through time, chewing khat is spreading into wider sections of our society.

The fact that significant numbers of university students and teachers are resorting to increasing consumption of khat has strong implications for other parts of the society, mainly for students in secondary schools. Undeniably, the university community is accorded a higher place by the society as a source of scientific knowledge and of highly educated citizens. Consequently, behaviors of students taken on by university students do have exemplary influences on prospective university entrants and students in secondary schools. When teachers come into the scene, the dilemma towards chewing chat steps up into sizeable magnitudes. Why should chewing qhat be considered as a potential problem while a growing number of the educated are allured into it?

A much more concern would be the amount of time frittered away in chewing khat. While time is such a scarce resource, it is quite disheartening to hear people claim that they chew qhat, and drink alcohol just to ‘pass’ their time. This trend is indeed dangerous especially when it is deemed so by the youth.

Those who chew khat waste away a great deal of time sitting idle. A growing body of the youth is wasting away precious time, as much as 4 or 5 hours a day, especially in the afternoons. Chewing khat induces users to drinking, consumption of other related drugs, promotes unproductive use of time, and has the potential to increase the likelihood of violence and crime.

While the market for khat is so lucrative, khat houses are also providing other drugs, both mild and strong for users. Hence the khat market has considerable potentials to pave the way for the market for other drugs. No doubt that the extensive use and unchecked regulation of qhat and other drugs would be dogged by devastating consequences as has been witnessed in other parts of the world such as Mexico.

More important however is the dilemma as to whether or not khat is considered as one of the drugs. On the one hand, khat is a cash crop, and contributes substantially to the national revenue. If so, discouraging and banning would be self-defeating. Allowing it, or even legalizing it might be better, but the trend is very hazardous in the long-run. To follow an indifferent approach with no clear strategy as to the issue of drugs would not evidently be a viable choice.

There would be no option to deal with problems when they arise. Hence there has to be clear legal provisions as to the use and circulation of khat and similar other substances. With the trends of current demand continuing, the price of khat will definitely rise which makes it downright expensive for the poor. Addiction is unlikely to be broken within the short-run, hence an upward trend for the use of khat and other related stimulant substances. The only thing that has toned down the problem of khat consumption insignificant in our country is the fact that it is not illegal.

In conclusion then, what would be our approach towards the rising consumption of khat in our country? Do we have a clear and comprehensive strategy to deal with the booming qhat market, and the swelling demand for those miraculous leaves? Or should we continue indifferent to the existing dilemma?

In my opinion, it is high time that we develop clear strategies towards the emerging khat market and the mounting demand for it. There has to be a consensus as to the use of khat and the disparate yet expanding market for it. The ambivalent perception towards the existing consumption of khat should not be allowed to continue into the future until it may soon or later pose insurmountable challenges to legislation.

We have to work out clear answers whether chewing khat should be legalized or outlawed. If the consumption of khat is prohibited by law, so too should be the domestic market for it. If legal prohibition of khat would open the Pandora’s Box, we have to formulate a clear strategy supported by the necessary legislation.",2015-10-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['ubiquitous', 'demand', 'students', 'university', 'khat', 'production', 'consumption', 'chewing', 'clear', 'market', 'drugs', 'ethiopia']",Somalia,news article,English

687,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Bow to your King! Genius Messi single-handedly drags Barcelona back from the dead - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en/news/bow-to-your-king-genius-messi-single-handedly-drags/tazpeii4khwb1i1jh8rfq1ajz,"Bow to your King! Genius Messi single-handedly drags Barcelona back from the dead

The Argentine proved his genius - and resilience - by leading the Blaugrana to a sensational victory in Madrid that has blown the title race wide open

COMMENT

Marcello Lippi was asked earlier this week if Lionel Messi was in decline. ""Every time I see Barcelona's results,"" the legendary Italian coach responded, ""I see goals and assists from Messi.

""I don't think he has declined; it's the rest of Barcelona that has declined. The drop-off is more in terms of the defence and that affects the whole team.""

Sunday's Clasico showdown at the Santiago Bernabeu proved Lippi right on both counts: Messi was as brilliant as Barca's defence was brittle.

Messi wins Clasico for Barca at the death

Yet the Catalans, thanks to their talismanic No.10, managed to prevail over their great rivals Real Madrid, thus breathing new life into a Liga title race that had appeared dead by claiming a dramatic, last-gasp 3-2 victory in one of the greatest games this famous fixture has ever seen.

Indeed, many Madrid fans had come to the ground expecting to bury Barcelona. Avoiding defeat would all but seal the title and deal a fatal blow to a Blaugrana side seemingly on the way out after their comprehensive Champions League elimination at the hands of Juventus. Remarkably, even Messi was being written off beforehand.

The Argentine had come into the game without a goal in his previous six matches against Real Madrid. This unprecedented drought was viewed by some as evidence that Messi was no longer the phenomenon of old - in spite of the fact that no player has scored more goals in all competitions across Europe's top five leagues (now 47 in just 46 games).

When it comes to appraising the talents of Messi and Ronaldo in the modern era, it seems that they are only as good as their last game, and whereas the Portuguese had fired Real into the last four of the Champions League with a hat-trick against Bayern, Messi had drawn a blank in Barca's midweek draw with Juventus.

Luis Enrique was even asked in his pre-game press conference if it was time for his No.10 to shine again. ""I think it’s time for FC Barcelona to show their full potential,"" the Barca boss replied. ""We shouldn’t focus on just Messi or anyone else.""

Messi scores 500th goal for Barca

Real did focus on Messi, though, seemingly intent on nullifying his influence by any means necessary. Casemiro was booked just 13 minutes in for cynically scything the 29-year-old down after being embarrassed by Messi's quick feet in the middle of the park.

Marcelo, meanwhile, left the Clasico's all-time record goalscorer (23) prone on the Bernabeu turf with blood pouring out of his mouth with a careless elbow to the face.

Messi would have his revenge, though, retaliating not with aggression but artistry, bravely refusing to stop running at his rivals. He made five dribbles in the first half alone; the rest of the players on the pitch managed two between them.

He was felled twice more by Casemiro before the break, twice more he picked himself up off the ground and continued to carry the fight to Real.

Thirty-three minutes in, he finally lost his Brazilian tormentor for the first time and capitalised in scintillating fashion. He took a pass from Rakitic in his stride to glide past Luka Modric before then leaving Dani Carvajal swinging at thin air as he slotted the ball coolly past Keylor Navas to level the game.

Messi was involved again as Barca took the lead with 17 minutes to go. The Argentina captain found his path to goal blocked - legally, for once - but Rakitic picked up the pieces and unleashed a thunderous strike that left the brilliant Navas with no chance.

When Sergio Ramos was rightly shown a straight red card for throwing himself into a disgusting two-footed lunge at Messi just four minutes later, the game appeared to be up for Real. However, the 10 men incredibly drew level when substitute James Rodriguez turned in Marcelo's cross.

Messi wasn't done, though. With just 13 seconds of injury time to go, he timed his arrival into the area to perfection before driving home Jordi Alba's pull-back to silence the Santiago Bernabeu with his 500th goal for Barca. Bloodied, battered and still sporting a black eye from a bruising encounter with Juve, he celebrated by showing them his jersey as a reminder that he remains the King of the Clasico.

They thought his reign was over. They were wrong. Barca may be in decline but Messi most certainly is not. As Luis Enrique pointed out afterwards, ""Messi is decisive even when he is at home eating dinner! He is the best player in history.""",2017-04-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['title', 'barcelona', 'bernabeu', 'barca', 'madrid', 'king', 'real', 'messi', 'drags', 'bow', 'goal', 'singlehandedly', 'genius', 'minutes', 'dead', 'game']",Ghana,news article,English

Our editors’ weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.

On our radar

Israel-Palestine toll grows as war looms

The intensity of what could turn into a fully-fledged war between Israel and Hamas and its allies in Gaza is ramping up so quickly that much is likely to change by the time you read this. At the time of publication, 119 people had reportedly been killed by Israeli bombs in Gaza, and eight inside Israel by rockets fired from the occupied Palestinian territory that is home to around two million people, who are for the most part unable to leave because of severe restrictions on movement by Israel and Egypt. The death toll is likely to rise, and cities and towns inside Israel that are home to both Jewish and Palestinian Israeli citizens have also seen outbreaks of intercommunal violence. Synagogues were set on fire in the city of Lod, and live TV showed a mob of far-right Israelis in Bat Yam dragging a man they believed to be Arab from his car, beating him bloody. The roots of what’s happening now clearly go far deeper than the rising tensions over the past few weeks, but we suggest you read this for the recent background on the deadly flare-up.

WHO accused of covering up sex abuse claims

The World Health Organization has been accused of covering up sex abuse claims against its workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the Ebola outbreak between 2018 and 2020. The WHO knew about allegations against one of its senior doctors during the Ebola crisis – a doctor with close ties to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus – but denied knowledge of the claims, according to The Associated Press, which obtained private emails, legal documents, and recordings of internal meetings. Another doctor allegedly tried to pay off a woman he impregnated. Neither of the men were disciplined, according to the AP. The New Humanitarian and the Thomson Reuters Foundation first broke the story last year about widespread aid worker sex abuse in Congo. This week, we published a second investigation with new claims of aid worker sex abuse during the Ebola outbreak. In total, 44 of the 73 women we interviewed accused men who said they worked for the WHO. Among the new claims: a woman who said she was raped by a WHO worker, and another woman who was allegedly lured into a sex-for-work scheme and died after a botched abortion.

Madagascar drought drives severe hunger

Southern Madagascar is facing its worst drought in 40 years, threatening more than a million people with severe hunger. The region received half of its usual rains during the October planting season and up to 60 percent of the coming harvest is expected to be lost. This is the third consecutive year of drought, and two in every five people are now “severely food insecure”, with nearly 14,000 people facing “catastrophic” levels of starvation – the first time such a degree of hunger has been recorded in the country. In the worst-affected district of Amboasary Atsimo, global acute malnutrition is an alarming 27 percent, a rate at which irreversible damage is caused to children. “The children are starving, some are dying,” said Amer Daoudi, a senior World Food Programme official. “We are already witnessing the abandonment of entire villages.” COVID-19 lockdowns have limited the ability of rural people to find work, and – with transport routes and delivery chains interrupted – food prices have risen. Needs are expected to deepen, with a prolonged and severe lean season forecast, starting in October.

No end to deadly demonstrations in Colombia

More than three weeks after nationwide protests began in Colombia, the political unrest shows little sign of abating. In Cali, the epicentre of the demonstrations, a power void as the strife took hold of the city has led to armed civilians fighting each other amid gasoline and food shortages. In recent days, “humanitarian corridors” have been set up to allow in some food supplies and medicine. On 10 May, President Iván Duque travelled to Cali to meet demonstration leaders upset with rising poverty, inequality, and state neglect – worsened by the pandemic. But talks ended without any agreement on how to end the deadlock. Marchers have expanded their demands to include healthcare reforms and an end to police brutality. Human rights groups say the police are responsible for most of the 42 protest-related deaths so far. Accusations of excessive force by the Colombian police, more used to fighting armed groups , further undermine its ability to take on the gangs and guerrillas that have expanded their control in much of the countryside five years after a widely praised peace deal.

Afghanistan’s school killings and a legacy of impunity

In a country tangled in decades of war, the 8 May bomb blasts outside a Kabul school were particularly shocking for who they appeared to target: children. It came a year after an attack on a maternity ward in the same community – where gunmen killed at least 24 people, including women in labour – provoked similar revulsion and pushed Médecins Sans Frontières to end its work at the hospital. An interview published by MSF this week underscores how little accountability there is for such atrocities. The Afghan government promised to investigate the May 2020 attack, but even a year later there are no answers. The ”most likely hypothesis” from MSF’s own inquiry landed on members of a group affiliated with so-called Islamic State, said Dr Isabelle Defourny, MSF’s operations director. Many Afghans see impunity as the barrier to peace and justice. It’s why groups like the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission called for “reparations and documentation”, along with a UN-backed inquiry, following this month’s violence. The MSF interview also shows the dilemmas aid groups confront, with civilian casualties rising and international forces set to withdraw by September. A year after the hospital massacre, MSF hasn’t resumed its operations there. “We can’t work in an environment where patients and medical staff are targeted, and where we can’t prevent such a massacre from happening again,” Defourny said.

Weekend read

The UK government’s plan to overhaul the country’s asylum system has drawn the ire of UNHCR. The UN’s refugee agency and other migration experts say it goes against the 1951 Refugee Convention and global protection ethics. UK Interior Minister Priti Patel says the plan will prioritise asylum seekers who arrive through legal channels while creating barriers for those who arrive irregularly. Rights groups and asylum advocates disagree. To them, the approach cashes in on public fears of a migration crisis to build a restrictive asylum system that would exclude many who need help. A review was needed, given the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, but the new rules could make migration even riskier than it already is, especially for women and children who don’t qualify for support. With EU governments refusing to sign bilateral return agreements, migrants who arrive in the UK and don’t qualify for asylum are in danger of being “warehoused in deeply inappropriate, inhumane facilities”, one civil society actor told The New Humanitarian. This comes amid rising numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach the UK as EU policies grow more hostile; nearly 8,500 crossed by boat from France in 2020, more than four times the number in 2019.

And finally…

Decolonising research

Foreign researchers in humanitarian settings have too often swooped in and conducted extractive studies without meaningful local involvement, according to a new briefing paper and related webinar. The paper says the academic world should properly regulate so-called “Parasitic Swallows'', as such temporary visitors can “do harm, retraumatising participants, and preventing them from evolving their identity”. Research “co-production” – involving the community as well as academics and NGOs in the entire process – offers a healthier model, according to a paper published by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",2021-05-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['cheat', 'severe', 'asylum', 'food', 'sheet', 'groups', 'sex', 'end', 'strikes', 'hunger', 'humanitarian', 'coverup', 'madagascar', 'rising', 'claims', 'israel', 'uk', 'gaza']",Somalia,news article,English

• In November, UNICEF provided medicine, medical devices and equipment to support the Government’s response to the victims of the explosion of the fuel tanker in Tete, which affected 149 people and killed 90 people.

• In December, UNICEF responded to the Government’s appeal to the cholera outbreak in Maputo city, with communication material and tents for the establishment of a cholera treatment centre.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The El Niño drought continues to affect 1.5 million people in Mozambique and it is expected that this number will be in need of food assistance until March 2017 and could possibly increase up to 2.3 million. According to IOM’s displacement tracking matrix (DTM), of the nine assessed IDP camps (8 in Manica and 1 in Sofala), a total of 15,128 people are currently displaced due on-going military conflict and drought consequences. Specifically, about 90% of the IDPs interviewed have identified security and conflict as the main reason preventing them from returning to their place of origin. The number of IDPs is expected to increase due to floods, cyclones and as military confrontations continue. The National Contingency Plan predicts under its Scenario I about 714,000 people to be affected by strong winds, floods, and cyclones among which, 190,000 will be displaced and in need of temporary accommodation centers.

From October to December 2016, the amount of rainfall has been consistent with the forecasts of the National Meteorological Institute for Mozambique, which predicted normal to above normal rainfall for the period in the south and central provinces (Figure 1), and normal to above normal for the period January to March 2017 in Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia (Figure 2). The northern parts of Nampula and Gaza expect below normal rainfall between January and March 2017. Although in general the forecast for the agriculture season is good, we expect there will be pockets of populations that remain food insecure and facing nutrition crisis due to a combination of factors including unavailability of seed during the planting seasons, poor agriculture harvest due to excess rainfall and localized floods, and inability of population, particularly in conflict zones, to access their land due to insecurity amid on-going military confrontations and damage to crops as a result of intense cyclone activity.",2016-12-30 08:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'idp', 'humanitarian', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'report', 'unicef', 'normal', 'military', 'situation', 'floods', '2016', 'idps', 'wash', 'manica', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
431,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"Drought, climate change turn Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan into a dust bowl - National Geographic",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/drought-climate-change-turn-iran-sistan-and-baluchestan-into-dust-bowl,"In southeastern Iran, summers have never been for the faint-hearted. The temperature routinely tops 110 F (43.3 C). There isn’t a hint of rain. When, every May, a vicious, hair dryer-like wind, known as the Wind of 120 Days, begins to whip in across the semi-arid flatlands, the entire area wanes under a months-long barrage of sand, cloying dust, and noise.

American soldiers across the border in neighboring Afghanistan are warned to be particularly wary when these gusts pick up. “High winds can turn tent pegs and loose objects into flying missiles (which may not be visible in blowing sand),” cautions “A Soldier’s Guide to Staying Healthy in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” a U.S. army medical manual. Locals are sometimes forced to shout at one another just to make themselves heard amid the breathless whistling.

And that was before things really went wrong. In recent years, Sistan and Baluchestan province, which makes up much of the most affected area, has become bogged down in a relentless wave of environmental disasters. A prolonged drought has hastened the disappearance of the storied Hamun wetlands, while higher temperatures continue to evaporate what meager surface water remains. At up to 1,500 square miles (4,000 square kilometers), the wetlands were a bountiful source of irrigation and promise in a land with little of either.

But now the dust storm season has expanded, sometimes spanning half the year—and so, as a consequence, has the volume of respiratory problems. In 2016, the UN’s World Health Organization ranked Zabol, a provincial hub, as the most polluted city on the planet. With agriculture now all but impossible and everyday life a struggle, locals and officials alike say that the region risks becoming uninhabitable.

“From one side of the wetlands, Afghanistan has built several dams in the upstream, and on the other, the area is faced with constant drought,” said Naser Moghaddasi, a senior advisor to the Iranian Department of Environment and the country’s delegate at the COP 24 climate conference in Poland in early December. “It’s created a hotspot in what was once a prime area for cultivation and created big problems for a lot of people.”

Country-wide threats

Where once deer and leopards rummaged for food, now fire engines stand ready to tackle the blazes that often erupt across the bone-dry landscape. According to local media reports, Sistan and Baluchistan received only 1.1 inches (29 mm) of rain this past winter, less than a third of its requirements.

Much of the Gulf might soon be too hot for humans.

Iran as a whole is buckling under the pressures of climate change and poor water management. Lake Urmia, formerly its largest body of water, has mostly withered away—as has Lake Bakhtegan, once the second largest in the country. At Isfahan, the Zayandeh River seldom flows these days, leaving the city’s famous arched Khaju Bridge high and dry. And, in June 2017, Ahvaz in Khuzestan province, aside the Persian Gulf, posted one of the highest temperatures ever recorded, 128.7 F (53.7 C). (Read more about the collapse of Lake Urmia.)

There’s every possibility the situation might deteriorate further, experts warn. Climate change-related woes are thought to have played a part in the fierce anti-government protests which roiled Iran in late 2017 and early 2018 and ultimately left at least 20 people dead. Much of the Gulf might soon be too hot for humans, according to a 2015 MIT study.

Regional collapse?

But in Sistan and Baluchistan, many horrors are already playing out. As a distant and isolated province with an almost entirely agrarian economy, it’s been poorly placed to adapt. In a possible harbinger of things to come elsewhere, it’s slowly falling apart.

Residents have migrated in droves. Up to a fifth of the province’s 2.5 million people are or soon will be on the move, according to a local member of parliament. Drug smuggling and addiction have proliferated, as some unemployed farmers get sucked into the trade and others get hooked on its wares. Some $28 billion-worth of drugs, mostly heroin, are ferried over the border from Afghanistan every year, according to the UN, some of which is launched over frontier guards by catapult under the cover of dust storms. Amid deepening poverty, rates of child marriage have reportedly surged, with girls as young as nine married off, often for their dowries.

(Read about the death of Iranian nomadic life.)

Authorities insist they’re aware of the danger. “We know we cannot continue to operate open agriculture in dryland areas,” Moghaddasi said. “We need to diversity our economy among people who depend on nature.”

He says his government is discouraging the cultivation of water-intensive crops, like rice, and expanding medical services in dust storm-heavy districts, such as Zabol. But the state is still mismanaging its water resources, experts say, leading some scientists to refer to the crisis as a “socio-economic drought.”

At the same time, Iran has jailed at least a dozen prominent environmentalists, including one who died in prison in suspicious circumstances early in 2018. Four of these men have since been charged with crimes that often receive the death penalty there. All are accused of espionage, in part because of their use of specialized equipment, such as camera traps, to record rare Persian leopards.

From international science collaborations to on-the-ground fieldwork, much environmental research has since come to a standstill. NGOs “have become paranoid. You self-censor. You limit your activities. You think you need permits for everything,” said Kaveh Madani, a scientist and water expert who served as deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment for several months until he fled the country in April 2018. “It’s also confusing for scientists. What data is available or should be publicly available? You start thinking about whether you could get in trouble for communicating with your research partner in the U.S.”

Kamp-e-Sakhi, Afghanistan – On a bright day in April, in the aftermath of flash floods, rays of sun fall onto the cracked clay soil in Kamp-e-Sakhi in some parts and, in others, illuminate large puddles that dot the raw land.

In the northern Afghan district, on the outskirts of Mazar-e Sharif city, antiflood bags still lie on the wet ground although they helped little when the water spread days earlier, destroying modest homes.

Somagul, a 60-year-old former farmer who left her home in Baghlan last year because of severe drought and pressure from the Taliban, did not expect the flood.

On March 29, the sound of water hitting her door awakened her in the middle of the night.

“We escaped in the dark with my children and grandchildren. There was no light, but we managed to find our way out, we got wet and dirty. All our things stayed in the house,” Somagul told Al Jazeera. “We went higher up to the street which was not flooded and we stayed there for the whole night. In the morning when the flood was gone, we came back.”

Although the flood soon reversed, Somagul and her family, including her sister, four children and 16 grandchildren, lost most of their few valuable possessions.

Electronic devices were among their most expensive belongings that were destroyed; it will take a long time to replace them.

Since the family moved to Mazar-e Sharif, only her son-in-law has managed to find work at the local coal market and they have no land to grow crops.

This was the second time in Somagul’s life that water-related disasters came to define her family’s fate.

Afghanistan, where the worst drought in a decade has displaced an estimated 260,000 people, has been struggling with the acute consequences of climate change, water mismanagement and 40 years of war that took its toll on the country’s weak water infrastructure.

Droughts and floods have become the norm, destroying the lives of Afghans across the country.

An upstream country, Afghanistan is not naturally water stressed. Eighty percent of its resources come from surface water that flows from snowfields and glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya mountains.

Over the course of Spring and Summer, the mountain snows melt and fuel Afghanistan’s five river basins.

From there, the water enters the canals and spreads across the country.

Most of Afghanistan’s irrigation depends on these resources. As the Afghan proverb goes, “may Kabul be without gold rather than snow.”

But ever since the Soviet invasion, the country’s infrastructure has been falling into ruin.

First, the bombings and years of fighting destroyed much of its canals. Then the Taliban administration did little to repair the damage, let alone build new infrastructure.

Following the US invasion, the Afghan government with the support of the international community has put water management high on its agenda, investing efforts to rehabilitate the canals.

But the infrastructure is inadequate for the needs of the country’s growing population.

Most of Afghanistan’s partners have been reluctant to support large projects, such as dams, which require substantial funds.

Antiflood bags did little to stop the damage in Kamp-e-Sakhi [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]

India, though, has sponsored the Afghan-India Friendship Dam on the Hari river and is planning the construction of Shahtoot Dam on the Kabul River.

Dams are crucial to store the water needed for irrigation and prevent flash floods, which have become frequent due to climate change.

In a country where agriculture contributes between 20 and 40 percent of the GDP, depending on the year, and employs about 60 percent of the workforce, the lack of investment has had disastrous consequences.

“Because of climate change, our winters have been getting hotter year by year and we’ve had much more rain in springs instead of snow in winters, which recently resulted in floods in many provinces especially in the north and west of Afghanistan,” Abdul Basir Azimi, water expert and the former deputy minister of energy and water told Al Jazeera.

“Twenty Afghan provinces experienced about a 60 percent decrease in snowfall during the last winter season in 2017, and before that.

“Severe drought throughout the country and excessively warm weather have affected the rural and urban populations, the agricultural economy and recently led to a tremendous increase in the number of IDPs.”

The dry and cracked land is a testament to Afghanistan’s devastating drought, the worst in a decade [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]

Drought has also affected the levels of groundwater that Afghan cities have been relying on for drinking.

Kabul is home to almost five million people and the capital’s population, according to estimates, will double in the next 10 years. The city has been particularly vulnerable to water shortages.

“Last year, we experienced severe drought in the country including in the Kabul River basin. The groundwater level dropped by more than 10 metres,” Tayib Bromand, water resources and climate change adaptation specialist at the ministry of water and energy, told Al Jazeera.

“In Afghanistan’s major cities there was not enough water for domestic supply. Particularly, the most elevated parts of Kabul do not receive sufficient water for drinking.”

Unable to access drinking water through the official distribution networks, Afghanistan’s population has been relying on unofficial wells with poor-quality water. Others have been using paid water delivery services provided by private companies.

Afghanistan has had to deal with many decades of war, and, as we've seen the world over, environmental issues sometimes exacerbate political tensions. Jenna Jadin, FAO scientist

While Afghanistan has now entered peace talks with the Taliban, internal displacement caused by the water crisis might further stir conflict.

In some areas, farmers have no choice but to join armed groups in order to feed their families.

At the local level, conflicts over water also erupt between upstream and downstream areas, as well as individual farmers.

Jenna Jadin, a scientist with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Afghanistan, told Al Jazeera: “We’re trying to make sure that water is incorporated into everything we are doing: for example, in projects where we’re teaching people to diversify their livelihoods and diets through planting new crops, we are also making sure to teach better water usage for those crops.

“We are also implementing projects that restore forests and rangelands, which will reduce surface water losses and soil erosion.”

But Afghanistan’s water scarcity has the potential to cause conflict on a regional level, too.

Due to insufficient infrastructure and decades of conflict, 70 percent of the country’s surface water ends up flowing into neighbouring states, all of which, apart from Tajikistan, are water stressed.

“Afghanistan’s situation has created an opportunity for the neighbouring countries to unfairly and unreasonably develop their agriculture lands at a very rapid pace downstream and also illegitimately transfer the water from the bordering lands to their central provinces,” Azimi said.

“The neighbouring countries have been irrigating hundreds of hectares of agricultural lands with water flowing from Afghanistan’s rivers, but on the other side, the neighbouring countries have built too many dams and not allowed any water [to flow] into Afghanistan.”

Afghanistan, therefore, has a pressing need for new dams to manage its scarce water reserves.

But more water staying in the country means less water for its neighbours. And while there are existing international agreements dealing with water scarcity between the five Central Asian states, for example, Afghanistan has not been part of them.

The only water agreement Afghanistan has signed was a 1973 treaty with Iran regulating the inflow of water to the country. But even that has not prevented conflict between the neighbours.

Afghanistan’s population relies on unofficial wells with poor-quality water [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]

The Afghan government has long accused Iran of supporting the Taliban in order to disrupt the construction of a dam on the Helmand River, which could potentially affect the delivery of water to the country.

Similarly, Pakistan, one of the most water-stressed countries in the region, opposes the construction of the Shahtoot Dam on the Kabul River sponsored by its archenemy India.

The construction of the dam could reduce the flow of water into Pakistan.

The potential of regional conflict is high and investing in water management is crucial for Afghanistan’s security.

While most of the country’s international partners are reluctant to make such costly, long-term investments that bring little profit, the government is increasingly seeing water as a security issue.

If “hydro-diplomacy” continues to be put high on the state’s agenda, not everything is lost.

“Afghanistan has had to deal with many decades of war, and, as we’ve seen the world over, environmental issues sometimes exacerbate political tensions,” Jadin said. “If we can help the people restore their environment it may very well have a positive cascading effect on other aspects of life.”",2019-05-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['rifts', 'war', 'afghanistans', 'water', 'dam', 'crisis', 'drought', 'kabul', 'diplomatic', 'afghanistan', 'river', 'pikulickawilczewskaal', 'country', 'agnieszka', 'deepen']",Afghanistan,news article,English

Following the sacking of Zdravko Logarusic, Sportsnetghana.com looks through five possible coaches who could take over the coaching job at Kotoko.



Maxwell Konadu



Konadu has been one of the experience coaches in the Ghana Premier League, he is currently Black Stars assistant coach, he has been heavily linked to re-join his boyhood club, Kotoko.



In his first stint as coach of Kotoko in the 2011/2012 season he won the Ghana Premier League.



Didi Dramani



After Maxwell Konadu left Kotoko after the 2011/2012, Dramani with no Premier League experience took charge of the Porcupine Warriors and he won the 202/2013 Ghana Premier League. He spent two seasons at Kotoko, in his last season he won double, the 2013/14 Ghana Premier League and the FA Cup.



With his exploits at the club he is a possible candidate to replace Zdravko Logarusic.



Bashir Hayford



Hayford is currently a free agent after leaving Ashanti Gold last week, the tough talking coach have had stints with Kotoko and he won the Ghana Premier League with the side in 2009.



Hayford made history during his days at Ashanti Gold, he became the first coach to end the club’s 20 year league title drought two seasons ago. With Kotoko coaching job currently vacant he is likely to get the nod.



Tom Strand



The Swedish tactician since the league started has been linked with a move to Kotoko, he is now without a club. Two seasons ago he guided Medeama to win their second FA Cup trophy. He has also been linked with Great Olympics.



Michael Osei



Osei’s return to Kotoko is possible. Before the league kick start he was the club’s caretaker coach, he was in charge of the club’s pre-season. With two weeks to start the Ghana Premier League he was shown the exit door.

Drought grips large parts of Afghanistan

A drought is affecting two out of three provinces across Afghanistan with more than two million people expected to become severely food insecure and in need of humanitarian assistance for survival.

Below average snowfall and a precipitation deficit of 70 per cent has been registered in most parts of the country, due to La Niña conditions (see Bulletin 71, December 2017). This has compromised the main wheat planting season of 2017/2018 that lasted from October to February for the fifth year in a row.

Water points and fountains across the country have dried up and the lack of rain and snow melt has made rivers run low or dry up completely. Faced with the lack of water, farmers have chosen to minimise their losses by delaying planting crops and reducing field sizes. “In many cases there was nothing farmers could do but watch the seeds dry out,” said Abdul Majid, the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) Coordinator of UN FAO. “The drought has already negatively and irreversibly impacted the winter agricultural season of 2017/2018 and is expected to also negatively impact the 2018 spring and summer agricultural season. The last harvest must be considered completely lost.”

Winter harvest lost, livestock and livelihoods of thousands of families in peril

The lack of water also affects farmers with livestock and pastoralists like the nomadic Kuchi tribe as pasturelands have partially or completely dried up or are overgrazed, leaving flocks with little or no feed. “Pastures are overfed and animals are eating the plants down to the roots where they can still find them,” said Abdul Majid.

The condition of animals has deteriorated and reduced their milk production which has led to distress sales and death of livestock: sheep prices have decreased from 25 to 40 per cent across the country while fodder prices have doubled. “The animals are too weak to walk to their usual pastures in Badakhshan province and herders have to rent trucks to bring them there,” explained Mr. Majidi, the Head of Agricultural Department of Kunduz Province.

Some 1.5 million goats and sheep in the North-Eastern Region are struggling to find food and more than 600 out of nearly 1,000 villages in the province are suffering from the lack of water.

The most affected are small livestock holders with ten animals or less. These families are at high risk of food insecurity as once their flocks are drastically reduced, the core breeding animals may be endangered and whole livelihoods are at risk.

Some communities in Hilmand Province have also reportedly started to use their irrigated fields as pastures as a coping mechanism – potentially saving their animals but in consequence not planting crops that could get them through the next lean season.

Conflict exacerbates the effects of the drought The intensified conflict across many parts of the country exacerbates the effects of the drought and has limited the communities’ access to markets: in Hilmand, village elders reportedly need to obtain special approval from the armed groups controlling their districts to access markets in areas under Government control.

In Uruzgan Province, people often cannot access the main market in Tirinkot due to fighting and insecurity on the roads to the provincial capital. Following a temporary closure of the road to neighbouring Kandahar Province in April due to fighting, wheat prices went up by 50 per cent in the city itself, and the price for fresh produce quadrupled within days.

First migration movements due to the drought in the Western Region At the beginning of May, the first migration movements were reported from Badghis and Ghor provinces to Hirat City, Hirat Province, due to the drought and depleted food stocks of families. By mid-May, more than 21,000 people had been assessed by humanitarian partners and verified as having migrated due to the drought.

Mohammad Aman from a village in Badghis is one of the people who was forced to leave his home.

He used to work the land of a landowner but the drought destroyed the crops, killed all the animals and left his employer unable to feed his own family, let alone pay Mohammad Aman’s salary.

The fifty-year old saw no other option than to go to the provincial capital Qala-e-Naw, hoping to find work in the city or assistance. “My entire family’s eyes are on my empty pockets and my inability to buy bread to fill their bellies,” he said. “It is difficult for a father so see his children going hungry.” His family was selected for emergency assistance and received wheat flour, rice, oil, sugar, pulses and salt from World Vision International (WVI) as part of a project to support more than 1,800 vulnerable families in Badghis funded by the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF)-Afghanistan.

Humanitarian partners are gearing up, need $115 million for six-month response

In the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, nearly 15 million people rely on farming, livestock or labour opportunities in agriculture. Of these, an estimated 2 million people will become severely food insecure due to the drought. Humanitarian partners are ramping up their response across the country (see map next page), trying to reach 1.4 million of the most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men struck by the drought. Partners urgently need $115 million; the majority of this amount will provide food support to help families through the lean season and to provide them with drinking water for six months.

A quick, comprehensive response will enable the delivery of food and water to the rural villages and help to avoid the migration of families to cities where they risk losing all of their few possessions, and where they lack shelter and access to health facilities and schools for their children.",2018-05-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['bulletin', 'food', 'livestock', 'drought', '75', 'afghanistan', 'issue', '2018', 'million', 'animals', '30', 'partners', 'humanitarian', 'province', 'families', 'lack', 'need']",Afghanistan,news article,English

He delivered firsthand knowledge of this “powerful threat to our planet and to humanity” by recalling the aftermath of the “two extremely severe tropical cyclones” that devastated vast regions of the country earlier this year.

Cyclones Idai and Kenneth not only took 689 lives, but also destroyed “the economic and social fabric in the Central and Northern regions of our country”, he said, adding that the South continues to suffer from the effects of drought and last year’s Cyclone Dindo.

The Foreign Minister reiterated Mozambique’s gratitude to the UN for its multifaceted support and expressed solidarity with the victims of Hurricane Dorian, which devastated the Bahamas just weeks ago.

Noting that natural climate-driven disasters have become recurrent phenomena, Mr. Pacheco affirmed Mozambique’s commitment to strengthening adaptation and resilience measures under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

Other actions Mozambique has undertaken include strengthening early warning systems and mapping vulnerable areas to prevent natural disasters and mitigate their effects.

With respect to rural development, biodiversity, ecosystems and natural resources, the Foreign Minister said Mozambique created conservation areas covering approximately 25 per cent of its national territory.

“These actions are reinforced by the continued increase of the use of cleaner and renewable energy, based on natural gas, wind, solar, and hydropower, to provide ‘Energy for All’ to our citizens by 2030”, he maintained.

Complex development challenges

According to Foreign Minister Pacheco, “low income; reduced access to education, health, food, water and sanitation; and inadequate socio-economic infrastructures” are all obstacles hindering the development of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Moreover, the prevalence of actions linked to fundamentalism, violent extremism, arms proliferation “are causes of added concern”, he said.

The Foreign Minister noted that to “drive our eagerly desired sustainable development”, his country has incorporated the 2030 Agenda into its national governance programme, giving priority to agribusiness, economic and social infrastructure networks, expanded electric grid coverage and ecotourism.

Moreover, Mozambique is focusing on “protecting and respecting human rights, promoting gender equality and equity, as well as capacity development women, youth and other vulnerable social groups”, according Mr. Pacheco.

Turning to teh country's peace agenda, the Foreign Minister lauded the successes of Mozambique’s internal dialogues, but cautioned that they were “shaded by bad actors” in the North who continue to raise concerns as they “spread death and destruction of the socio-economic fabric, and create instability in areas of that region”.

“The Government has vigorously carried out our constitutional duties to protect our citizens and their property, as well as economic and social infrastructures”, said Mr. Pacheco, adding that the fiscal and monetary reforms underway “have led to an effective recovery of our macroeconomic stability”.

He concluded by reaffirming Mozambique’s trust in the UN as “a privileged platform for multilateral coordination in the search for solutions to the common challenges facing humanity”.",2019-09-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['warmings', 'mozambique', 'mozambiques', 'foreign', 'global', 'nefarious', 'cyclones', 'minister', 'natural', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'development', 'country', 'vulnerable', 'social', 'warns', 'address', 'pacheco', 'recovering']",Mozambique,news article,English

156,Drought Sri Lanka,No rain no grain - Ceylon Daily News,https://dailynews.lk/2017/01/18/features/104994/no-rain-no-grain,"Blue skies and drying reservoirs are to be a regular feature in the foreseeable future as we are to brace ourselves for one of the worst droughts in our recent history.

As water bodies dry up district after district, the Ministry of Disaster Management as of yesterday has estimated that thus far 111,329 families in the districts of Trincomalee, Kandy, Kalutara, Hambantota, Monaragala, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Mannar, Batticaloa and Ratnapura have been affected by the drought. The numbers are staggering and yet this is just the beginning of our problems.

What do we know so far?

It has now become apparent that due to the less than average rainfall experienced during the monsoons last year, currently there is a water shortage in all our reservoirs. Furthermore, the Meteorology Department has predicted below average rainfall in the next three months.

The rains are next expected in Mid March and the country needs to find a way to survive until then.

The water shortage will also spill into other areas such as power generation and food production and this will add to the current precarious situation.

Minister of Disaster Management, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa at a media briefing last week revealed that most main irrigation tanks were up to 27 percent capacity while 220 medium size tanks were at 30 percent capacity. In addition, this year, only one-third of all agricultural lands were cultivated which meant that there would be less food produced during the Yala season with effects spilling over to the Maha season as well.

“We have also had less than 35 percent of the rice fields sowed in the main rice belt of the country,” said Yapa adding that the government had decided to import 250MT of rice to meet the demand.

With the drought thus posing a serious challenge to the country’s food security, Prof Mohan Munasinghe, founding Chairman of the Munasinghe Institute for Development and Chair of the Expert Commission on the Sustainable Initiative said,

“The issues we are going to face in the next three months is a good warning about what will happen in terms of climate change in the next 20-30 years. Our study at the Institute shows that in the next 20-30 years, small farmers in the Dry zone will suffer very much. Climate models also show that rice output in the Dry zone can drop by 15 percent or more.”

This begs the question, do we save water for drinking or let our agricultural fields which grow our food have it? The government in the meantime has warned that they would be shutting off water for agricultural purposes in certain areas given the shortage. Running short of drinking water thus has been a major worry all around but the National Water Supply and Drainage Board General Manager, G.A. Kumararathna speaking to the Daily News said they had not made assessments of reservoirs and rivers as of yet as the problem had not become grave thus far but they would look into having some controls in another six weeks. “We will look into controls during the latter parts of February,” said Kumararathna.

According to Amarnath Giriraj, Sub Theme Leader, Water-related Disaster Risk Management at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), however, the best solution to deciding where the water should go could be planned using knowledge on the current water resource availability and its demand, which is efficiently monitored through water resource modelling and satellite data.

More Importantly, he asked that the “Irrigation, Agriculture and Water Resources Department have better coordination on the demand and supply chain on the implications of drought on livelihoods and agricultural practices.”

Meanwhile, adding to the problem, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has warned the government that they would have to find an additional 60MW electricity to avoid a power crisis in the next six months. They warned that the risk would be most severe during January and April with the country’s reservoirs experiencing the lowest water levels in the last 10 years. Accordingly, the government has taken steps to purchase power from private power generators. Other recommendations from the PUCSL include encouraging of self-generation mechanisms, installation of new generation plants and to have rooftop solar generation.

What should be done?

This is not the first nor will it be the last time, the country would face a drought. According to Giriraj, “Overall, South Asia is experiencing an increase in the intensity and frequency of the drought events.”

When it comes to Sri Lanka, he said, “The two major recent droughts in 2012 and 2014 were a result of monsoon failures in either of the Maha or Yala seasons.”

Similarly this year too, the failures of the monsoons in the Yala and Maha seasons of 2016 have led to the current drought.

With droughts becoming a familiar feature of the Sri Lankan landscape, it has become vital that we safeguard our most precious resource- water.

“We will have to look into saving water,” said Kusum Athukorala, Chair of Net Water and Regional Coordinator for the Global Water Partnership.

“We are heading into a situation where droughts will become the norm and we can reduce the problem by stopping the illicit logging and destruction at the catchments, stop polluting our waterways and save the good quality water we have and adopt household water savings,” she explained.

Household water savings are not a new concept; dual flushes, water efficient fixtures and fixing leaking taps have been advocated for a long time but it is the implementation of it all that is lacking.

“In Parliament, I saw taps that were leaking. They should set an example first,” she observed.

More importantly, she pointed out that the country had very little preparedness to deal with environmental disasters such as drought.

“We are still hoping that business, as usual, will prevail. We are only looking at bringing in more bowsers rather than looking at protecting our catchments,” she said.

“Further, we have always chosen curative rather than preventive measures. It is suggested that we look at desalination plants but that is very expensive. If we looked at preventive measures, we would be keeping our catchments pristine, even if we are to have less rainfall, we have a better chance of recharging our groundwater if the catchment was in good condition,” she said.

More policies, less action

Sri Lanka, however, is not a dry country per se, it is home to 103 rivers with 90 percent of the total land area of Sri Lanka belonging to a river basin. We also have 3,540 identified water sources in the island in addition to the 12,000 tanks located in the Dry zone alone. The problem thus is the proper utilisation and distribution of water.

The Ministry of Land and Land Development in 2014 in a bid to become more proactive came up with the “Draft National Policy on Protection and Conservation of Water Sources, their Catchments, and Reservations in Sri Lanka”.

“Considering the utilisation pattern of the country’s water resource, it appears that the protection of the above-mentioned sources is a fundamental requirement for the sustainability of both the surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers. For instance, the capacity of the shallow aquifers in the Kalpitiya peninsula could have fulfilled the drinking water requirement of a large population. But such waters have been contaminated to a level which could not be purified due to the excess adding of chemical fertilizer, agrochemicals, and insecticides to the soil,” stated the draft.

“Today Sri Lanka is badly experiencing the threat of silting in reservoirs which generate hydropower and supply irrigated water due to the clearance of catchment areas in high altitudes and poor water and soil conservation practices. For instance, 38 percent of the capacity of Rantambe reservoirs has been silted within 09 years of its construction while Polgolla and Rantambe reservoirs are being silted annually by 2.52 percent and 6.95 percent respectively,” it further noted.

The draft policy also identified that one of the major obstacles in the path to taking any action lay in the fact that around 40 legislations passed since 1930, pertaining to water sources conservation was included under various sectors from land development, water, and forest conservation to soil conservation. Hence no one was directly responsible for conserving our water sources.

In addition, though there are a number of institutions involved in various activities related to the conservation of water sources, they are not properly conserved and protected due to the dearth of human and physical resources, various institutional as well as technological factors and improper exchange of spatial data related to this. Though some foreign funded projects were launched for the conservation of catchment areas, their objectives could not be achieved as they are not carried out after the prescribed project period.

The suggestions the draft policy proposed were, “Identify, demarcate boundaries, protection and conservation of water sources, empower the institutions related to the conservation and protection of water sources, monitor activities and follow up action, awareness and participation in water conservation programmes at community level and the granting of financial provisions and facilities for programmes”.

The policy, however, did not see the light of day and the officials of the present Lands Ministry are not aware of the existence of this very policy.

All is not lost

Environmental disasters, in the end, while cannot be avoided, can always be mitigated or be prepared for. Giriraj explained that prediction of weather forecasts over the recent years has improved substantially with 90 percent of monsoon forecast skills being highly reliable.

“Our drought forecast system for South Asia can predict lead-time of 15-20 days in advance on the probability of drought conditions using climate and weather information,” he said.

Given the advantage of the technology at hand, he proposed that we use active early warning systems such as the nowcasting drought monitor to identify slow motion of drought progress.

In the long term, Giriraj proposed, “Investment in soil and water management, such as the improved development and management of fragile catchment areas and river basins, including small-scale irrigation; reviewing the appropriateness of current crop production patterns and possibilities in support of more intensified crop diversification policies; redirecting research towards more appropriate farming systems and improved rangeland and livestock management”.

In the end however, there are only so many water bowsers that the government can muster and Giriraj said that ultimately the government would need to review institutional arrangements and physical infrastructure of many of its agencies in order to deal with situations such as drought in addition to looking into developing new crops, cropping strategies and insurance schemes when settling into a very dry future.",2017-01-18 08:00:00+00:00,[],Sri Lanka,news article,English

Click here to see the revised Plan.

Overview of the crisis

Mozambique is facing significant pockets of severe food insecurity, mainly due to poor rainfall and the fall army worm (FAW) invasion, which have contributed to reduced crop production, particularly of maize. The drought is also causing increased levels of malnutrition, water scarcity and school drop-outs, as well as heightening the risk of communicable diseases and of exacerbating HIV rates.

Mozambique experiences natural hazards every year, particularly given its geographical location (the country is located downstream of nine international river basins and has a long Indian Ocean coastline with active cyclone activity) and the social and economic vulnerability of the population. Drought occurs primarily in the southern region, with a frequency of seven droughts every 10 years. The recurrence of these climatic shocks in shorter cycles has negated efforts to reduce vulnerability across many communities.

The 2017-2018 rainy season was characterised by a late start, extended mid-season dry spell (DecemberJanuary) and heavy rains. Although the 2017-2018 rainy season performed better than the 2015-16 El Niño episode, the dry spell resulted in moisture stress and wilting of early planted crops in many areas. This has caused below average agricultural yield, particularly in southern and some central parts of Mozambique. Although the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security affirms that there is enough food availability at the aggregate level, the country is facing significant pockets of food insecurity, mainly due to the poor rainfall performance and the fall army worm (FAW) invasion that contributed to reduced crop production, particularly of maize. According to the FAW early warning system (FAMEWS), the infestation level in Mozambique is estimated to be between 21 to 40 per cent and the high likelihood of an El Niño event could contribute to the multiplication of the pest, given its high reproductivity in dry conditions.

Climatic predictions for the 2018-2019 rainfall season indicate normal to below normal rainfall for the southern and central regions, and normal to above normal rainfall for the northern region, according to the National Institute for Meteorology (INAM). As of 3 December, the likelihood of an El Niño had been revised to at least 80 per cent during the period between November 2018 to March 2019, according to the official El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecast. This poses a high risk for the Mozambique 2018-2019 cropping season, especially in already drought-affected southern and parts of central regions. Households in these areas will likely be forced to plant multiple times after repeated attempts, resulting in crop failures, as well as depletion of household seed stocks.

An estimated 814,700 people in five provinces are facing the most severe levels of food insecurity (IPC 3 and above) and need life-saving assistance during the lean season. The most affected provinces are Cabo Delgado, Inhambane, Gaza, Sofala, and Tete. Gaza province, for example, has nearly 22 percent of its population – more than 318,000 people - affected by the crisis. Tete, Inhambane, Sofala and Cabo Delgado reported together almost 500,000 people in IPC phase 3. This population is a prioritised subset of the overall number of severely food insecure people in 11 provinces, which is estimated at 1.78 million people (IPC phase 3 and above) for the period of September to December 2018, according to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis and the food security and nutrition assessment conducted by the Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition (SETSAN) in October 2018.

The impact of rising food insecurity is compounded by high levels of poverty, as well as the Government’s limited fiscal space to respond effectively. Despite a downward trend in the incidence of poverty over the years, the number of poor people remains high and inequality is growing. Almost half of the population (46.3 per cent) continues to be poor in monetary and non-monetary terms; with 84.9 per cent living in rural areas. Recent poverty analysis conducted in Mozambique shows that cyclone, flood or drought can lead to a drop of up to 25 to 30 per cent in per capita food consumption and that affected households also cut back on expenditures in basic non-food items.

Agricultural production is likely to diminish, particularly in areas where there is a risk of low rainfall and likelihood of increased incidence of pests and diseases. The rain-dependent agricultural sector, which accounts for around 25 per cent of Mozambique’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs nearly 75 per cent of the labour force, is highly vulnerable to drought and other natural hazards, with an estimated loss of US$20 million per year, according to the World Bank. Nearly 94 per cent of the poor are primarily engaged in agriculture for their subsistence. Based on the initial analysis from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA), the crop water needs index is reportedly low in seven provinces, including in Inhambane and Gaza areas in the southern region. In the first quarter of 2019, significant improvement is expected in the northern and central regions, with the exception of Tete province (reporting low index), while the southern region is expected to show between low and very low index, particularly in Inhambane and Gaza. There are already some indications in Gaza province of families reliant on small livestock moving to forest areas in search of green pasture and water, increasing the risk of conflict with wild animals. For December 2018 to April 2019, the Technical Secretariat for Food and Nutrition Security (SETSAN) has prioritised 815,000 people in five provinces for immediate humanitarian assistance. For January to March 2019, it is projected that the population in need will slightly reduce to 737,000 people, assuming that the crop water index will be adequate and a green harvest will take place in February 2019.

An estimated 19,500 children in nine districts are expected to suffer from Acute Malnutrition during the next six-month period, according to the IPC Acute Malnutrition analysis conducted in April 2018 by SETSAN. Five districts will be in IPC Acute Malnutrition (AMN) phase 2 or above during the 2018-2019 lean season. Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) is expected to increase from acceptable to alert/serious levels (IPC phase 2 and 3) with GAM rates between 6 to 10.9 per cent, particularly in Balama, Cabo Delgado, Marara in Tete province, Milange in Zambezia province and Macossa in Manica province, largely due to: low quality and quantity of infant feeding; increased occurrence of childhood diseases, such as diarrhoea and malaria; low coverage of health and sanitation services; and low access to safe water sources. Results from the SETSAN analysis have shown a critical food security and nutrition situation in five districts in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to conflict and violence: Quissanga, Macomia, Mocimboa da Praia, Nangade and Palma.

Families are expected to adopt negative stress coping strategies in almost all of the affected provinces, heightening protection risks, particularly for women and children, according to preliminary indications in the October 2018 SETSAN report. The most severe cases are in Gaza, Inhambane and Sofala, where families are already adopting crisis strategies (17 per cent) and emergency strategies (13 per cent) respectively, including: selling of productive assets and animals; and taking children out of school to perform household chores, including fetching water, and begging. In the past – including during the 2015-2017 El Nino - rising food insecurity has heightened the risk of child labour, child trafficking and forced marriage. Past anecdotal evidence suggests that the age of sexual debut lowered to 11- or 12-years during drought, with older men engaging with girls aged 11 to 13 as they went about water collection activities.

Drought continues to negatively impact children’s well-being and their access to education, often leading to student absenteeism, poor concentration in class due to hunger and thirst, and ultimately contributing to a decrease in children’s learning outcomes. Shortage of water leads to migration of the most vulnerable rural families and consequently their children drop out of school.

Access to safe water is also a challenge, including due to drought.Only half of Mozambicans have access to improved water supply and only one in five use improved sanitation facilities. There is a large disparity between urban (80 per cent) and rural water supply coverage (35 per cent), and only an estimated 40 per cent of rural schools have water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities for learners and teachers. Unimproved sanitation has been linked to poor maternal health, with 90 per cent of underweight mothers having access to only unimproved sanitation. Diminished rainfall has heightened challenges to accessing safe water. The storage level of the Pequenos Libombos dam, located in Maputo province, was only 22.6 per cent as of 29 November 2018. Pequenos Libombos dam supplies the cities of Maputo, Matola and Boane and has not been above 50 per cent since the severe drought in 2016. However, water resources authorities expect that by March 2019 the storage level of the dam may increase and reach 50 per cent of its capacity, based on available forecasts. At the peak of the lean season in drought-affected areas it is expected that around 296,000 people will need some form of WASH intervention, as localised water stress levels will impact the waiting time at water points as well as longer return distances for water trucking.",2019-01-23 08:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'ipc', 'province', 'humanitarian', 'cent', 'particularly', '2019', 'food', '2018', 'low', 'poor', '20182019', 'season', 'rainfall', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
1442,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Flood risk awareness: Dialogue around “re-location” has arrived - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/climate-change/flood-risk-awareness-dialogue-around-re-location-has-arrived-1004165991/,"Canadian P&C insurers believe they are starting to make headway with national and provincial governments on the climate change adaptation file. This has put the industry in the thick of a relatively new political dialogue about re-locating Canadians who live in high-risk flood plain areas.

Silvy Wright, president and CEO of Northbridge Financial Corporation, has just become chairwoman of Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), a national trade association representing Canada’s private home, auto and business insurers. In a wide-ranging discussion about IBC’s priorities during her upcoming term, Wright noted that the P&C insurance industry will continue to support the work of national, provincial and territorial governments in advancing the cause of climate adaptation.

“Climate change is a societal challenge, not just an industry challenge,” Wright said. “IBC is focused on working with the government to drive increased investment in climate change resilience. That includes developing a national flood plan.”

Working on the flood plan is at the centre of identifying areas in Canada at high risk of flooding. Wright said four key points have emerged from discussions with governments and other stakeholders about updating the plan.

“We have to begin raising awareness about high-risk areas,” Wright told Canadian Underwriter. “We believe we still have consumers who are not aware of that risk and, unfortunately, are left in dire situations when a catastrophe event [like a flood] occurs.

“Second, we have to deal with re-location of property in high-risk areas. This isn’t just the insurance industry; we are working with governments to support that.

“The third key item would be to advocate for a moratorium on new buildings in flood plains.

“And of course, investing on needed infrastructure. Using our [P&C industry] data and our mapping gives governments the data intelligence to make proper decisions and help consumers manage their risk.”

IBC president and CEO Don Forgeron says governments now see the P&C industry in a leadership role when it comes to adaptation to climate change. He noted that the industry has been talking about climate change for 30 to 40 years, but the issue has become prominent over the last decade.

Severe weather has caused almost $1-billion worth of insured catastrophe losses annually for most of the past 10 years. This year, as Wright noted, the industry has paid out $600 million for damage losses due to severe weather – and there has not been a single major catastrophe yet this year.

The industry is continuing to find success working with governments to improve the country’s flood maps, Forgeron said. Such maps are important for showing which Canadian areas and properties are at high risk of flood. That in turn allows Canadians living in high-risk flood areas to protect themselves — or even move out.

Flood maps are at the root of a new political dialogue – echoed within the insurance industry – about whether damaged property in flood zones should be rebuilt in the same high-risk areas, or simply re-located into to a lower-risk area.

“[Re-location] is a new concept in Canada,” Forgeron said in a conference call with Wright. “At other times, it was about rebuilding everybody in the same flood plain, where they’ve been flooded in three out of the last four years. Now we are talking about actually moving them out of there. I think that’s an indication of how serious the issue has become.”

The water ram-headed deity Khnum forming humans on his potter’s wheel - Canadian Museum of History



Papyrus depicting Isis and Osiris



Habi the Blue Nile God



Ancient Egyptian crocodile deity Sobek

CAIRO – 28 June 2020: When many contemplate the name ""Nile"", the first thing that comes to their minds is Egypt, which is easy to explain, given the great importance of this river to Egypt throughout history.The famous Greek historian Herodotus summarized the importance of the river to the Egyptians by saying ""Egypt is the gift of the Nile"".There are many myths associated with the Nile, including that the Nile is the gift of the gods, and that its flood season begins with the appearance of the brightest star; when it overflows, it brings prosperity and fertility; the gods control the river, and the deity Khnum is the lord of the water who brings prosperity and creates humans from the mud of the Nile River flood; the deity Habi controls the flood of the Nile because he is both genders and therefore very fertile; parts of the body of the severed god Osiris is in the Nile; and that the Nile’s flood and its decline were linked to the death and resurrection of Osiris and the myth of worshiping the Nile animals (the crocodile deity Sobek).The ancient Egyptians thought that the Nile is the gift of the gods. They equated it with life itself, and they organized their daily lives according to the high and low levels of its water. The Egyptian calendar was based on the three seasons of the Nile: The flood, agriculture, and harvest.The flood season began with the appearance of ""Al-Shaary Al-Yamani"" or ""Sirius"", which is the brightest star. Its appearance also means the beginning of a new Egyptian year.Herodotus' sayings and recordings show that the flood of the Nile was coincident with the summer solstice phenomenon, that is, June 22/23 of every year.Because the Nile means life, when it overflows it brings prosperity and fertility to the soil and people around it, but if its water level rises too much, people lose their mud houses, and if the level does not rise enough, drought and famine occur.Thus it was important for the gods to control the river. The two main deities involved in organizing this process are Khnum and Hapi, according to legend.Khnum, the Nile god with a ram's head, was the god of water, who brings life to the banks of the river, where plants grow and animals reproduce, and since silt forms after the flood, Khnum was also thought to create humans.Elephantine Island, now in Aswan, was home to worshipping Khnum, while his temple is located in the city of Esna, located 60 km south of Luxor Governorate in Upper Egypt.As for the god Habi, he was the one in control of the flood of the Nile. Usually, this god appears in both genders, having male features and a female upper body, which reflects both the personality of the father and mother of the Nile, and so he/she is able to achieve fertility. Surprisingly, the word “Habi” means ""happy"" in the ancient Egyptian language.In multiple scenes in different temples, such as Karnak and Luxor temples, Habi can be seen with lotus and papyrus. This indicates the union of Upper Egypt, represented in its logo, the lotus flower; and the lower represented in its logo, the papyrus.In addition, God Osiris played a role in one of the famous legends of the Nile, and this legend says that Osiris was killed by his brother Set because of jealousy. His body was cut into 40 pieces, and thrown into the Nile, which, in turn, threw shredded parts of Osiris' body in the Mediterranean.However, his wife, Isis, succeeded in finding and collecting his body parts, and thanks to the magic powers she possessed, Isis managed to revive Osiris and conceive a child, and then gave birth to Horus who grew up in the papyrus field in the delta, far from his malevolent uncle Set.Later, the god Horus succeeded in avenging his father, Osiris, by killing his uncle Set, and from here the death and resurrection of Osiris became associated with the flood of the Nile and the decline of its water level.Some sources say that the ancient Egyptians believed that the flood of the Nile was the tears of Isis, mourning the death of her husband Osiris, which is what is now called in Egypt “Wafaa el-Nile” [Loyalty of the Nile], which the Egyptians celebrate for two weeks starting from August 15.For this reason too, sources indicated that Egyptians threw similar items into the River Nile ""until it calms down and stops flooding.""Furthermore, many Nile animals played a major role in ancient myths indicating that the ancient Egyptians' fear of crocodiles and hippos pushed them to worship them, so as to ensure their protection from attacks and from evil in general.The crocodile ""Sobek"" was a god worshiped in Fayoum, and in Kom Ombo in Aswan. Some fish and birds of the Nile were seen as a sign of abundance, livelihood and resurrection in the afterlife.In 1954, the Egyptian leader at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser, decided to build the High Dam in Aswan on the banks of the Nile. However, the artificial lake behind the dam threatened the monumental temples of Abu Simbel as well as other Pharaonic treasures.Therefore, Egypt and Sudan launched an urgent appeal to UNESCO in 1959 to protect antiquities. Indeed, 22 artifacts have been saved, including the Abu Simbel Temple, which has been dismantled to 16,000 pieces and moved to a new location in a process that required the participation of some 2,000 scientists, engineers, experts, and workers.",2020-06-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['flood', 'egypt', 'gift', 'water', 'egyptian', 'egyptians', 'nile', 'khnum', 'god', 'osiris', 'river']",Egypt,news article,English
440,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan (2018 - 2021) 2020 Revision (December 2019) - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-response-plan-2018-2021-2020-revision-december-2019,"People in Need 9.4 million

Planned Reach 7.1 million

Requirements (US$) 733 million

Operational Partners 147

The 2020 update to the Afghanistan multi-year Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP 2018-2021) requests US$733 million and aims to reach 7.1 million people who are acutely affected by the humanitarian consequences of the country’s four decades-long conflict, as well as natural disasters. The complexity of needs and response in this environment cannot be underestimated with every one of the crosscutting problems identified in the 2020 Global Humanitarian Overview1 currently affecting the people of Afghanistan.

Due to the continued high tempo of the conflict and the setbacks created by the drought, the HRP’s multi-year projections and framework for action have been reviewed. As part of a course adjustment, a revised, broader definition of humanitarian action is being applied for 2020 and 2021 which more accurately reflects the current scale and trajectory of needs in a highly volatile security environment. The revised response strategy maintains the HCT’s prioritization of emergency needs but also extends the scope of the response to include vulnerable people with ongoing needs for support, as well as people who require resilience and recovery assistance to prevent them slipping into more serious humanitarian need. This will see humanitarians respond to some of the country’s estimated four million protracted IDPs who had previously been outside the plan, as well as more people with specific vulnerabilities such as women who are heading households, people with disabilities and those experiencing mental health issues. Several sectors have included a range of resilience and recovery activities which, while more expensive in the short-term, will create savings and reduced suffering for beneficiaries in the long-term. The result has been a higher number of people in need (9.4 million), a more ambitious plan for reach (7.1 million) and an increased financial requirement ($733 million).

Cross-cutting response priorities for 2020 include continued action on prioritised recommendations from the 2019 Peer-2-Peer mission; an expansion of in-country cash capacity and improved decision-making on the use of cash; piloting of Area-Based Response; expanded thematic preparedness planning; a focus on accountability to affected people; improved monitoring of response coverage; and better analysis of the gender, disability and mental health dimensions of the response. The forging of closer relationships and aligned planning between humanitarian and development actors is also a continued priority under the HRP. Leveraging the relatively expansive footprint and human resources of humanitarian organisations to help vulnerable people bridge to longer-term, sustainable development assistance is a focus for 2020. This was a key lesson learned from the 2018-2019 drought response.

Revised definition of humanitarian action in Afghanistan

Humanitarian action in Afghanistan provides life-saving emergency assistance to people in need, whether they are displaced or not. It also supports the most vulnerable people who are unable to access basic services or ensure their own survival, aspiring to leave no one behind. It aims to preserve people’s dignity, improve their living conditions, and strengthen their coping capacity and resilience. Humanitarian action also assists host communities to cope with accommodating IDPs, refugees and returnees.

Humanitarian action in Afghanistan aims to protect people’s rights and safety under international law and support those with special needs. The humanitarian community responds to people with physical and psychological trauma to foster their recovery and ability to play an active role in society. Humanitarian action opens the way for recovery of vulnerable populations through livelihood, asset- creation, cash-for-work and system-strengthening programmes, bridging people to more sustainable development assistance.

Humanitarian action aims to be integrated, coordinated, principled, rapid, effective and accountable, and guided by multi-year planning. It includes the use of cash where appropriate and aims to address people’s needs across all sectors. The humanitarian community supports affected people to make decisions about the assistance they receive and to safely access complaints mechanisms.",2019-12-31 08:00:00+00:00,"['aims', 'recovery', '2019', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'million', '2020', 'plan', 'response', 'vulnerable', 'humanitarian', 'need', 'revision', 'action', 'needs', '2021']",Afghanistan,news article,English
132,Drought Sri Lanka,Under the Radar: Sri Lanka’s drought threatens credit downgrade - Global Risk Insights,https://globalriskinsights.com/2017/03/under-the-radar-sri-lankas-drought/,"Sri Lanka’s ongoing drought is not only a humanitarian crisis, but also an economic one, as the country’s economy suffers on multiple fronts.

Sri Lanka has been experiencing rainfall shortages since last October, resulting in the worst drought in 40 years. With the country’s economy under severe stress, there is little relief in sight until the June / July monsoon season. Some districts have seen a 60-70% reduction in rainfall, resulting in widespread land degradation. This has led to the lowest amount of cultivated acreage in 30 years, with the World Food Program noting that only 35% of the country’s rice paddies had been cultivated by November 2016.

Concerns over food production are common during droughts, yet the situation in Sri Lanka highlights the convergence of multiple risk factors. The lack of rain has not only damaged rain-dependent crops, but has also led to a shortage of irrigation water necessary for the country’s water-intensive staple crop – rice. Agriculture accounts for 9% of Sri Lankan GDP and employs 28% of the country’s workforce. In response to the drought, the government announced the implementation of relief payments to the approximately 900,000 people affected by the drought.

Specifically, the government will provide Rs. 10,000 ($66) for every acre of blighted land per family per month for four months. With around half of national rice paddy acreage affected (1.5 million acres), the cost of this effort will account for between 0.1 and 0.2% of GDP; this does not include relief efforts for other crops.

Entire agricultural supply chain in turmoil

The agriculture sector is not expected to make a full recovery in 2017, even if sufficient rain falls during the rest of the year. In order to combat food shortages, the government has accepted food and water aid from India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand as well as increased food imports. To encourage imports Sri Lanka has cut import taxes on rice from 15 to 5 rupees per kilo. While this may aid imports, the measure also adds additional fiscal pressure on a government whose foreign reserves are dwindling.











Another issue are the government price controls on rice which, while fixing prices between Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kilo of various types of rice, risks unrest. The government is attempting to prevent inflation and price-gouging from further exasperating the food crisis, but not everyone is happy. While the move benefits (especially low income) citizens, rice millers are complaining about losses. Having purchased rice at higher wholesale prices prior to pricing limits, millers are now being forced to sell at a loss. On February 13th, some 120 leading millers refused to sell at government prices, calling for between Rs 80 to Rs 90 per kilo, and demanding to meet with President Maithripala Sirisena.

On February 21st, Sri Lanka’s price control agency conducted cross-country raids on 52 stores, arresting the owners for selling rice above government prices. Unlike small business owners, major millers have significant political clout, with one of the largest being Dudley Sirisena, the president’s brother. The government must walk a careful line in order to ensure cooperation from millers and protect food security. President Sirisena finds himself in a difficult position, especially since he championed his outsider status during the 2015 elections to win the presidency; touting his hardworking attitude, degree in agriculture and origin from Sri Lanka’s north-central rice bowl. If the populace thinks Sirisena is not doing enough to combat the drought, or is bending to pressure from business, the likelihood of unrest will increase.

More than food production affected

Concerns about the balance between business and public interest goes beyond rice milling, with MP Douglas Devananda warning against plans to relocate Coca Cola’s largest South Asian plant from India to Sri Lanka. Devananda has cited water-related complaints against Coca Cola’s 57 Indian bottling operations, including the fact that the company has been banned from drawing from the Thamirabaran river.

“With such [drought] conditions prevailing in Sri Lanka, Coca Cola wants to use our water resources to meet the demands of their largest consumer market in the region: India. How can this be allowed?” Devananda complained in parliament on February 24th.

The drought has also led to an energy crisis in Sri Lanka, as reservoirs are only at 29% capacity. As a result hydro-electricity generating rates are only 30% of installed capacity, a major problem for a country that relies on hydro-power for around 40% of total production. This forced state-owned utilities to purchase $50 million worth of electricity from the private sector in January and increase fuel imports: oil imports doubled in January alone. Increased fuel imports have further widened the trade deficit which has grown to $957 million (December 2016) up from $827 million in 2015. This is yet another financial drain on Sri Lanka and contributes to the rupee’s continuing devaluation. The rupee has already lost 1% in 2017, following a 3.9% drop in 2016 and 10% fall in 2015.

The rupee’s devaluation combined with increased imports and other drought effects saw consumer price inflation hit a record high of 6.8% in February compared to the same period in 2016. Dwindling foreign reserves threaten balance-of-payments pressure from foreign outflows at a time when Sri Lanka is negotiating up to $2.5 billion in foreign financing.

Drought threatens Sri Lanka’s IMF loan goals

Overall the effects of the drought have already lowered the 2017 GDP growth forecast from 6% to 5%. Direct government actions against the drought could cost $264 million, with state minister for finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena stating that the government may need around $1.5 billion for drought contingencies. By way of comparison the entire national budget for 2016 was $5.5 billion. The effects of the drought have derailed Sri Lanka’s efforts to tackle systemic overspending, with the government projecting a 17% increase in spending, versus a 0.6% increase in 2016.











With a budget deficit of 7.4% of GDP in 2015, Sri Lanka was already facing serious fiscal headwinds, as the country’s inability to rein in government spending undermines its financial stability. As a result the drought is hampering Sri Lanka’s efforts to reduce the budget deficit to 4.6% – a key goal of the country’s $1.5 billion IMF loan. With fiscal deficit calculated at 5.2% for 2017, Sri Lanka faces a credit downgrade if it fails to meet its loan conditions.

In response, finance minister Ravi Karunanayake countered that “we have drafted the budget factoring in these uncertainties […] The budget deficit doesn’t need to swell up just because of one abnormal condition.” The minister went on state he expects 6% growth despite the drought and that the government is not considering a waiver on the IMF’s deficit target. International observers are less optimistic, with Moody’s warning of the “negative credit effect of the drought” and assigning Sri Lanka a B1 credit rating with negative outlook.

An artist’s impression of Zhongguo Zun in the CBD. The building, which will house offices of CITIC Group, will be the tallest in Beijing when it is fi nished, standing 510 meters. WU LU / FOR CHINA DAILY

BEIJING - Developers working on a new skyscraper, which once built will be the capital's tallest building, say they will break ground on the project on Sept 19.

CITIC Group, which won the rights to the land in the Central Business District with a bid of 3.6 billion yuan ($563 million) last December, plans to build a 510-meter-high office tower with 104 floors above ground and four basement levels.

""The final design hasn't been decided yet, as the group is waiting for the municipal government's approval, but the building will be higher than 500 meters,"" an insider at CITIC Real Estate who refused to be named said on Monday.

The new skyscraper is called Zhongguo Zun, which means China Goblet, as the inspiration for the design came from an ancient ritual vessel. Construction will be completed in five to seven years, the insider said.

The land where the building will stand is in the north of the CBD, which houses many international companies. The capital's tallest building now is Tower 3 of China World Trade Center, which is 330 meters tall and is also in the CBD.

""It is going to become a new landmark for the city,"" said an official in charge of the CBD who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

The skyscraper is expected to serve as an office building for CITIC Group. ""The company will occupy the whole building, and even then the space will not be enough,"" added the CBD official. ""Also, the company can't rent any of that office space for 10 years, as stipulated in the contract it signed with the municipal government.""

Wu Chengtao, editor of Skyscraper Magazine, said: ""The building, to some degree, demonstrates the city's image and economic strength, and will attract more investment. Besides, the competition among cities, both at home and abroad, has become more and more fierce, triggering many cities to pursue more super high-rise buildings.""

He said at least three skyscrapers above 600 meters were under construction in Shanghai, Wuhan and Shenzhen. The number of buildings higher than 500 meters is much larger, ""and I can't remember them all"", he added.

""Considering its economic strength and influence as the Chinese capital, Beijing could build one higher than 700 meters,"" said Wu. ""However, the tallest building will be about 510 meters, which shows the city is pursuing stable development.""

The design of the new skyscraper adopts many elements from traditional culture, such as the Kongming (Floating Paper) Lamp. ""The building will remind people of the ancient Chinese city, representing Beijing's image perfectly,"" said Wu.

However, the high-rise will bring about some problems, experts say.

""Having a large amount of people concentrated in a limited place will put huge pressure on transport and the environment,"" said Yan Jinming, a professor of land management at Remin University of China. ""Plus, the requirements for foundations, equipment to prevent disasters and fires are more strict, thus the cost is much higher.""

Wu agreed and said that since the CITIC Group is involved in broad business, lots of related enterprises will move closer for convenience, causing a hike in rental prices.

""However, as more jobs will be created, on a whole, the advantages brought by the new skyscraper will outweigh the disadvantages,"" he added.

79,DR-2014-000109-CHN,UPDATED: Keeping Filler Ingredients Out of Your Cup of Coffee - Newswise,https://www.newswise.com/articles/keeping-filler-ingredients-out-of-your-cup-of-coffee,"Clarification: The research discussed in this press release focused only on ground, roasted coffee available in Brazil. The use of commercial coffee from Brazil allowed the researchers to develop and perfect chromatographic methodologies for detecting several filler ingredients common to tested coffee. The resulting methodologies will allow for testing of coffee from any market. Until such testing is done, the results of this research cannot be extrapolated to the U.S. or any other country. The National Coffee Association, USA has issued a statement regarding its efforts to ensure that coffee is not adulterated.

EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE: Monday, Aug. 11, 2014, 5 a.m. Eastern time Note to journalists: Please report that this research will be presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.

Newswise — SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11, 2014 — Coffee drinkers beware: Surprise ingredients that are neither sweet nor flavorful may be hiding in your coffee, and growing coffee shortages may increase the chance of having these fillers in your cup of joe in the future. The good news is that a highly accurate test is in the works to quickly find coffee containing unwanted fillers before the beverage reaches stores and restaurants.

These extra ingredients, though not harmful, make ground coffee go farther and increase profits for producers, according to researchers. Their report will be part of the 248th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world’s largest scientific society. The meeting features nearly 12,000 reports and is being held here through Thursday.

A test to detect counterfeit coffees is becoming more important in light of growing shortages in regions, such as Brazil, where droughts and plant diseases have dramatically cut back coffee supplies. “With a lower supply of coffee in the market, prices rise, and that favors fraud because of the economic gain,” says research team leader Suzana Lucy Nixdorf, Ph.D.

In 2012, a study from the U.K.’s Royal Botanic Gardens and the Environment stated that 70 percent of the world’s coffee supply might disappear by 2080 because of conditions caused by climate change. But shortages due to more immediate issues already are occurring. The coffee-rich country of Brazil typically produces 55 million bags of coffee each year. But according to some reports, the projected amount for 2014 will likely only reach 45 million bags after this January’s extensive drought. That’s about 42 billion fewer cups of coffee for this year.

Now, however, Nixdorf and her team at State University of Londrina in Brazil have developed a way to nip coffee counterfeiting in the bud.

“With our test, it is now possible to know with 95 percent accuracy if coffee is pure or has been tampered with, either with corn, barley, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, acai seed, brown sugar or starch syrup,” she says. The problem, she explains, is that “after roasting and grinding the raw material, it becomes impossible to see any difference between grains of lower cost incorporated into the coffee, especially because of the dark color and oily texture of coffee.”

In new research, the team is now analyzing several fillers that are considered impurities rather than adulterants. These impurities can even be parts of the coffee plants, introduced at harvest, that are not really supposed to be in the final product. Wood, twigs, sticks, parchment, husks, whole coffee berries or even clumps of earth that are almost the same color as coffee have been found. Identifying them is essential because if there is a large amount of impurities, they were probably added purposefully — not by accident, as some producers claim, says Nixdorf.

Currently, tests to detect these unwanted additives require scientists to check the coffee, and those tests are subjective –– not quantitative, she says. With these tests, the scientists look at the coffee under a microscope or identify various additives by simply tasting the coffee. In contrast, the new test uses liquid chromatography and statistical tools. This gives her team a much closer look at the ingredients in an unbiased way, according to Nixdorf. Chromatography is a powerful analytical technique that is very sensitive and highly selective.

Because much of the coffee is composed of carbohydrates, researchers could develop a “characteristic fingerprint” when using chromatography that separates out the real coffee compounds, says Nixdorf. The added, unwanted grain fillers generate different levels of sugars than the natural ingredients, so they are easy to identify, she explains.

Title Strategy to detect adulterations in ground roasted coffee: An association of carbohydrates content and profiles with chemometric tools

Abstract Coffee is one of the most popular drinks, consumed for its refreshing, stimulating taste and health benefits; and ranked as second-traded worldwide commodity. Its high-price combined with certain ground roasted coffee characteristics, like brown color, particle size and oily texture, attracts fraudulent adulteration, allowing cheapest admixture of roasted and grinded fillers. As a matter of economic order, husks, sticks, corn, cocoa seeds, barley, wheat middling, chicory, soybean, triticale and acai seeds are commonly added. Since simple visual inspection enables to differentiate genuine ground roasted coffee from adulterated one; microscopy is conventionally applied. However, this technique is limited to semi-quantitative assays, requiring trained and skilled analysts. So, it remains great challenge to develop a non-subjective method, selective for distinct markers and quantitative reproducible for industrial quality control. Beside, carbohydrates as major grains macronutrient stand as tracer by its profile and content to assess coffee authenticity. Despite efforts from studies, food matrices complexity and variability still requires strategies to uncover adulteration. Thus, this approach uses HPLC analyses associated with chemometric tools on new analytical resources for detection of ground roasted coffee adulterations. A validated high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection method was investigated to determine total carbohydrates content profiles of pure roasted coffee beans and adulterants. The influence of each matrix was evaluated employing a simplex-centroid design for experiments with mixtures, relating mixing ratio with each monosaccharide by its response surfaces. Proposed models were effective in recognition and prediction of mixtures concentration, thereby allowing distinction of genuine coffee by principal component analysis. Predominantly, pure roasted coffee presented higher levels of galactose and mannose. Profile of diverse roasted grains as sources of fraud will be shown. All results correspond to polysaccharides from pure raw grains, confirming this approach as a feasible analytical tool for detect adulteration of ground roasted coffee.",2014-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['filler', 'research', 'fillers', 'ground', 'keeping', 'updated', 'ingredients', 'cup', 'team', 'coffee', 'roasted', 'test', 'society', 'brazil']",China,news article,English

(PTI Photo)

Cyclone, Weather forecast Highlights: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) Saturday said the Severe Cyclonic Storm Tauktae over eastcentral Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 13 kmph during past 6 hours.

It lay centred over eastcentral Arabian Sea near latitude 14.2N and longitude 72.7E at 2030 hours IST on Saturday, about 190 km southwest of Panjim-Goa, 550 km south of Mumbai, 780 km south-southeast of Veraval (Gujarat) and 910 km south-southeast of Karachi (Pakistan). It is very likely to intensify into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th & cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar & Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening.

As it would bring very heavy rainfall in that region, cities like Mumbai would not be affected much, the IMD added.

There will be strong winds and heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 17 over north Konkan, including Mumbai,

the IMD said.

The Maharashtra capital can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, said Shubhani Bhute, senior director (weather) IMD, Mumbai. The storm is currently 250 km south-west of Goa, she added.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated. He also called for ensuring maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health and drinking and their immediate restoration in the event of damages caused to them, a statement said.",2021-05-16 04:02:27+00:00,"['km', 'eastcentral', 'winds', 'mumbai', 'diu', 'imd', 'cyclonic', 'weather', 'thiruvananthapuram', 'storm', 'highlights', 'severe', 'tauktae', 'gujarat', 'cyclone', 'arabian', 'sea']",Pakistan,news article,English

As much of New Mexico grapples with drought, the state could see the summer’s first significant monsoon activity this weekend.

“We’re kind of getting into that pattern where we’ll have those daily chances of showers and thunderstorms each day,” said Scott Overpeck, meteorologist with the National Weather Service Albuquerque office.

But dry conditions will likely persist for much of the week. On Tuesday, portions of eastern New Mexico will have red flag warnings for critical fire weather, thanks to low humidity and high winds.

................................................................

Albuquerque will cool off midweek, with a high of 86 degrees on Tuesday and 89 on Wednesday.

On Thursday, dry thunderstorms with lightning are possible for southwestern New Mexico. Albuquerque will have a high of 91 degrees Thursday and Friday.

Temperatures trend upward toward the end of the week, as do chances for rain.

Albuquerque will have a high of 92 degrees Saturday and 91 Sunday.

The region will start to see moisture from the eastern Pacific, and upper-level high pressure will begin to build over the Southwest.

“That’s where we’re looking at the possibility of our monsoon kicking in for the summer,” Overpeck said.

To help gauge the potential of the North American monsoon, meteorologists examine sea surface temperature differences in the Pacific Ocean, short-term weather prediction models and long-term climate models.

Climate change appears to be playing a role in how much rain New Mexico receives from the monsoon, NWS meteorologist Andrew Church said.

“Over the last 10 to 15 years, we have seen a more volatile polar jet stream that has been drying us out more than in the ’80s and ’90s, when we had wet monsoons which were more frequent,” Church told the Journal.

Dry westerly winds often accompany the storms, Church said, and the Four Corners high-pressure system is getting stronger.

“You have to go higher up in the atmosphere before thunderstorms can develop,” Church said.

Summer outlooks predict near-average precipitation across most of New Mexico.

“It’s fickle, and highly dependent on location,” Church said. “We haven’t seen a robust monsoon in 14 years now.”

157,Drought Sri Lanka,Q&A: Land degradation could force 135 million to migrate in next 30 years - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/qa-land-degradation-could-force-135-million-migrate-next-30-years,"By Manipadma Jena

NEW DELHI/BONN, Oct 18 2016 (IPS) - One of the critical challenges facing the world today is that emerging migration patterns are increasingly rooted in the depletion of natural resources.

Entire populations are being disempowered and uprooted as the land that they rely on for their survival and for their future no longer provides sustenance.

Many people will move within their own region or to nearby cities, driving unplanned urbanisation. Up to 135 million people are at risk of distressed migration as a result of land degradation in the next 30 years, says a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) vision document.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) along with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change both envision land rehabilitation and restoration as significant actions in development and addressing climate change.

Governments from all over the world are currently meeting in Nairobi in order to agree on the strategic direction of the Desertification Convention. IPS correspondent Manipadma Jena interviewed Monique Barbut, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, ahead of the ongoing fifteenth session of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC15) in Nairobi. Excerpts from the interview follow.

Q: With as many as 170 countries affected by drought or desertification, how could these factors drive conflicts and forced migrations?

A. Two Somali proverbs,_nabadiyocaano_ meaning ‘peace and milk’ and _col iyoabaar_ which means ‘conflict and drought’, illustrate the strong connection between stability and access to pasture and water. The world’s drought-prone and water scarce regions are often the main sources of refugees.

But neither desertification nor drought on its own causes conflict or forced migration. But they can increase the risk of conflict and intensify ongoing conflicts. Converging factors like political tension, weak institutions, economic marginalisation, lack of social safety nets or group rivalries create the conditions that make people unable to cope. The continuous drought and water scarcity from 2006 to 2010 in Syria is a recent well-known example.

Droughts are natural phenomena, they are not fated to lead to forced migration and conflict. Severe droughts also occur in countries like Australia and the United States, but government intervention has made these experiences bearable.

For poor countries where safety nets do not exist, the intervention of the international community is vital.

In Mali, for example, unpredictable and decreasing rainfall seasons have led to a decline in harvests. More and more herders and farmers’ are moving into cities searching for employment. In Bamako, Mali’s capital, population in just over 20 years has grown from 600,000 to roughly 2 million with living conditions becoming more precarious and insecure. As Lagos fills up with those fleeing desertification in rural northern Nigeria, its population now 10 million. Disillusioned, unemployed youth are easy prey for smugglers, organised drug and crime cartels, even for Boko Haram.

Pastoralists face similar challenges when they are compelled to move beyond their accepted boundaries in search of water and pasture and risk clashing with other populations unwilling to share resources. Clashes between pastoralists and farmer are a serious challenge for governments in Somalia, Chad and Niger.

Q: Which other countries are showing signs of vulnerability to extreme droughts in the near future?

A: Drought occurs in almost every climatic region. With climate change, droughts are expected to spread to new areas and to become more frequent and more intense. The vulnerable regions are Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle-East and North Africa, South-Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Australia, Brazil, India, U.S. and China. In the coming decades, most of the United States, the Mediterranean region, Southwest Asia, Western and Southern Africa and much of Latin America, especially Mexico and Brazil, will face extreme droughts.

The more important question, however, is “who is going to be affected and what can be done about it?” The livelihoods of the poor in developing countries will be the most impacted because they rely heavily on natural resources. So, more investment is needed to incentivise them to adopt sustainable land management (SLM).

But frankly, the investments we have for land rehabilitation are insufficient. We must also improve land tenure security because farmers with secure ownership are more likely to adopt good practices. Improving access to markets and rural services will create alternative non-farm employment, reducing pressure on land and the impacts of droughts in turn.

Q: A lot now hinges on achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) which requires a paradigm shift from ‘degrade-abandon-migrate’ to ‘protect-sustain-restore’. UNCCD aims to achieve LDN by 2030. Given the tremendous and diverse pressures on land for economic growth, also from large populations in regions like Africa and Asia, where do you see their achievements in 14 years?

A. We want to move from business as usual to a future where the amount of productive land passing from one generation to the next remains stable.

In the current scenario, large numbers of people and a large share of national economies are tied to the land sector, particularly in the developing countries. So any degradation of the land reduces a country’s productivity. Unsustainable land use practices costs Mali about 8 percent of its gross domestic product, for example.

By 2030, along with a higher world population, a large middle class will emerge, accelerating the demand to draw more from these land-based sectors. For Africa and Asia to bridge these gaps, the farmers need to keep every inch of their land productive. This switch to sustainable land management however needs strong government support – to move farmers to scale up these good practices, to recover degraded lands and to prevent losing the most productive lands to urbanisation.

Reforms would move credit, market access and rural infrastructural development to ignite sustainable growth in agriculture. This is what it will take, to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030.

The Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative that seeks to restore degraded lands and create green jobs in the land-based sectors is a good example of this vision. The Desertification Convention is working with partners around the world to develop initiatives that are linked to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of achieving land degradation neutrality by 2030.

Q: Which countries are faring better in turning around land degradation and what is the key factor driving this achievement?

A. A 2008 global assessment showed that most of the land restoration since 1983 was in the Sahel zone. But we have seen a rise in global attention to land degradation through diverse initiatives. that include the Conventions on Biological Diversity and Climate Change,the Bonn Challenge on Forest and Landscape Restoration and the New York Declaration on Forests. There are also regional initiatives such as Initiative 20×20 in the Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa’s Great Green Wall and initiative AF100, also in Africa.

Once the SDGs were adopted last year, our ambition for 2016 was to have at least 60 countries committing to set voluntary national targets to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030. We have surpassed that target. Today, we have more than 100 country commitments.

This achievement is due, in part, to the success of a pilot project that enabled 14 countries to assess and politically communicate the potential returns each would get by reversing land degradation in target areas. Armenia, Belarus and Ethiopia could quantify how they could meet their national obligations under the climate change agreement by pursuing land degradation neutrality.

Some common patterns among the countries that tend to fare better in fighting land degradation and drought (DLDD) is strong government leadership that values the socio-economic benefits accruing to their people and political commitment to make effective policies. They also have active champions of good land use practices which can be NGOs, development and private sector partners as well as small and large farmers.

Q: UNCCD is open to private business funding for projects under LDN. Which type of projects would businesses -for- profit show investment interest?

A. There is a growing appetite in the private sector for sustainable land use projects that can contribute to land degradation neutrality. More industry players have committed to LDN-related initiatives and other environmental targets. Companies committing to reduce the ecological impacts of their commodity supply chains rose from 50 in 2009 to nearly 300 by 2014, Supply Change reported in 2016. Many businesses dealing in agricultural and/or forestry commodities get raw materials from the land, and may be interested in investing in projects that make their supply chains more sustainable.

But there is no dedicated public funding pool investing globally in projects to combat land degradation, and public financing alone is not sufficient to protect our planet’s ecosystems. The private sector needs to step up. This is what created the need and opportunity for a new dedicated funding source –the LDN Fund. It combines public and private capital in support of the SDG target of land degradation neutrality.

The sustainable agriculture, sustainable forestry (including agroforestry), land rehabilitation and conservation, and the ecotourism sectors can support profitable investments. Forestry has attracted 77 percent of all capital raised for LDN investments to date. Agriculture is expected to see the strongest increase in investments and to grow by nearly 350 percent by 2021. It is clear that projects that incorporate at least some component of food and/or timber production are more likely to generate a stable cash flow are more appealing to private investors in LDN.

In the developed countries, many of the conservation activities receiving private investment are backed by government legislation. A strong regulatory framework provides certainty to the market and helps to create end buyers. As a result, the investments attract steady flows of private capital.

Q: Do governments need to put in place smallholder-safeguard mechanisms for private investments in land?

A. Safeguard mechanisms that recognise the land rights of smallholders are vital, even when the farmers have no formal tenure. Smallholdings support billions of livelihoods, which makes these households extremely sensitive to land use change.

In developing countries, government policies designed to attract investment are often biased towards large-scale farming, and hardly offer the protection to smallholders require. Private investors should have their own safeguards but governments have a responsibility to implement and enforce mechanisms to protect smallholders. The LDN Fund is designed to align with progressive global environmental and social standards.",2016-10-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['million', 'land', 'world', 'countries', 'private', 'investments', 'desertification', 'projects', 'migrate', '135', 'drought', 'sustainable', '30', 'qa', 'degradation', 'force', 'ldn']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
310,FF-2016-000062-IDN,The Fête de la Musique survival guide - CNN Philippines,http://cnnphilippines.com/life/entertainment/music/2016/06/16/fete-de-la-musique-2016.html,"Manila (CNN Philippines Life) — Sudden downpours, long MRT lines, and flash floods are all signals that summer is officially winding down — and subsequently, this also means that music festival season is almost over.

As a last hurrah for the summer, the Alliance Française de Manila is celebrating its annual Fête de la Musique in Manila on June 18 and 23. As in the past years, the lineup is almost as act-heavy as big music festivals like Coachella or Lollapalooza. Festivities start at 4 p.m. at the A-Venue open-parking main stage with the electronic musician BP Valenzuela and the experimental hip-hop/soul musician RH Xanders. Reese Lansangan will open the main stage in the Greenbelt 3 park at 4:30 p.m., and over a hundred acts will be performing at various pocket stages scattered around the Makati area. Admission is free to the festival, featuring performances from local and international musicians under genres that range from bedroom beats and Xperimental to grunge and electronica.

Fête has always been the perfect opportunity to discover new music, which can make it tempting to go to all the stages. Though the venues do seem theoretically close to each other, having to go back and forth to catch your favorite bands could be tiring and pricey. With that in mind, CNN Philippines Life has come up with a solution to help you make the most of this year’s Fête: a nifty little guide featuring festival essentials, a list of the stages that are close to each other, and quick tips.

Prep the essentials

Sure, Makati is dotted with 7-Elevens around every corner, but it doesn’t hurt to over-prepare maybe just a little. For Fête, it would be best to pack a light bag, dress comfortably, and do away with whatever you don’t think you’ll actually end up using for the day. Keep it practical: Bring your phone, a power bank (or even just your charger, because you never know where there could be plugs), tissues or wipes, hand sanitizer, an umbrella, and maybe a change of clothes. You can also opt to bring water and snacks, and even a book or something else to pass the time with in case you find yourself in the middle of a long wait. Bring emergency cash and spare change for commuting.

Make a checklist for artists and stages you want to see, and pay attention to schedules and venues, and how far apart they are. (More on that below.) Research routes for commutes to save cash on cab rides. If you’re bringing friends — definitely advisable for the festival! — write down their numbers just in case. A legal ID might also be wise to keep with you, as some places may want to check for them.

Game plan

There are 21 pocket stages situated around the Makati area. The diverse lineup features everyone from Pupil to up-and-coming indie bands like Oh, Flamingo! In the list below, grouped are the stages that are close to each other.

Jazz Stage at Sage Bar, Shangri-La Makati*

Bedroom Beats Stage at The Belle & Dragon*, starts at 4 p.m.

Acoustic Stage at A Space

Hiphop Stage at M Cafe*

Blues-Soul-Funk Stage at H&J Sports Bar and Restaurant*

Blues Rock Stage at Le Cafe Curieux*

Eclectic and Art Stage at Lokal Hostel

Evolution of RnB Stage at Z Hostel

Mod Stage at Alchemy Bistro Bar*

Xperimental/Folk Stage at Pineapple Lab

Reggae Stage at B-Side, The Collective

Punk Stage at Mang Rudy’s Tuna Grill and Papaitan*

Grunge Stage at Aloha Bar & Grill, The Collective*

World Stage at The Cabin Bar & Bistro*

Electronica Stage at Time

Fusion Stage at Century City Mall (4th Floor)

Rock Stage at Green Sun (The Eye)

Indie stage at Green Sun (Axon)

Food will be sold at the SOMA Bistro

Stages that are outliers are: F*K Stage at Finders Keepers*; House Party Stage at Black Market, which starts at 10 p.m.; and Open Mic & Spoken Word Stage at Acceler8.

*Marked places serve food.

Here’s a map to illustrate which places are closest to one another.

Make the most of it

Fête de la Musique is a free event, but that doesn’t mean you can take it for granted. It brings together hundreds of artists from all over the world to celebrate music, even if they’re not well-known or they seem out of the ordinary, playing music that doesn’t cater to certain tastes.

There are three rules of thumb, then, to make sure you get the best that the festival has to offer: Go out of your comfort zone, check out at least one new band or type of music that you’ve never heard before, and don’t just stay in one place. Going back and forth to catch certain acts and sets may be tiring, but you just never know what you’ll miss. Plus, it’s the weekend — for just a few hours, it wouldn’t hurt to pretend that you’ve got all the time in the world.

308,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Nineteen migrants found suffocated in truck at DRC-Zambia border - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/nineteen-migrants-found-suffocated-in-truck-at-drc-zambia-border/a-19340406,"Congolese authorities confirmed on Saturday that they had discovered the bodies of 19 migrants who had asphyxiated in a Zambian-registered truck earlier in the week.

Border guards in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) said they had been alerted by the sickening smell coming from a truck which was revealed to have been carrying some 100 refugees.

The seventy-six living migrants were rescued when the vehicle was stopped on the Zambian border in southeastern Congo on Thursday.

""We stopped this vehicle ... because of the nauseous smell which was coming from the trailer,"" said Jean-Pierre Lubosha, head of the DRC border control. He told the press that the crew had at first claimed to be transporting fish.

""The bodies were handed over to the Zambian authorities on Thursday. We interviewed the survivors who all claimed to be Ethiopian nationals,"" said Lubosha.

There had been some discrepancy about the nationality of the migrants, as Zambia initially claimed they were Somalis.

Ethiopia is currently experiencing its worst drought in 50 years, leaving milions in need of food and water.

Zambia promises to put pressure on trafficking

""We congratulate the Congolese authorities for their vigilance, allowing them to discover this scandalous human trafficking, implicating three Zambian members of the [truck] crew,"" said Zambian vice consul David Nyangulu, who added that an international investigation was underway.

Following the deaths, Zambia promised to step up the fight against human trafficking.

""Our country has very porous borders, but we will put in place measures to ensure cases of human trafficking are curbed,"" Home Affairs Minister Davies Mwila told a local radio station.

897,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Frank McCourt is offered $1.2 billion for Dodgers - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2011-sep-01-la-sp-dodgers-mccourt-sale-20110902-story.html,"In an international twist in the Dodgers’ ownership saga, Frank McCourt has been offered $1.2 billion to sell the team to a group indirectly financed by the government of China.

The bid is headed by Los Angeles Marathon founder Bill Burke, according to a letter sent to McCourt on Tuesday. The letter was disclosed to The Times by two people familiar with its content but not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The proposed sale price would set a record for a Major League Baseball team. However, the bid was received with skepticism within MLB, where executives wondered whether the proposal might be used by McCourt to stir negotiations with other potential buyers or to persuade a Bankruptcy Court judge to keep McCourt in charge of the team.

“There are questions within the sports industry about whether this is a genuine offer,” said one industry consultant who works extensively with MLB and other professional sports leagues.

Advertisement

The offer was unsolicited, according to a person who had spoken with McCourt’s representatives but was not authorized to discuss the conversation.

It is uncertain whether the embattled Dodgers owner is receptive to the offer. McCourt has said that he had no interest in selling the Dodgers and that he intended to remain the owner after the team emerges from bankruptcy protection.

Steve Sugerman, a spokesman for McCourt, declined to comment on whether McCourt had received the letter and whether he would consider selling the team.

In a brief telephone interview, Burke declined to discuss the bid. “I have no comment at this time,” he said.

Forbes magazine estimates the Dodgers’ worth at $800 million. McCourt bought the Dodgers for $430 million in 2004, and the team and related entities carry debts of “over $550 million,” according to a June 20 letter sent to McCourt from MLB Commissioner Bud Selig.

The bid terms proposed by the Burke group call for an all-cash payment to buy the Dodgers, all real estate related to the team and the team’s media rights, according to the letter. Attorneys for McCourt have said he could try to keep Dodger Stadium and the surrounding parking lots even if he sold the team.

The offer would expire in 21 days, according to the letter, with the goal of closing a deal within 90 days, subject to the approvals of MLB and the Bankruptcy Court.

The letter did not say whether the bid would be subject to the approval of Jamie McCourt, the ex-wife of Frank McCourt, who claims half-ownership of the team. But Jamie McCourt probably would endorse a deal since she had asked the judge overseeing the couple’s divorce to order the Dodgers sold, a request that was then withdrawn in deference to the Bankruptcy Court.

The bid was presented on behalf of the Burke group by Signal Capital Management of New York. The firm has offices in Beijing, according to its website. Shane Rodgers, its chairman and chief executive officer, said in an email that the firm would not comment “on any potential or proposed transactions.”

The letter did not specify who would finance the Burke bid, other than to say the money would come from “certain state-owned investment institutions of the People’s Republic of China” and unidentified American investors. Foreign investment is not necessarily an obstacle to MLB ownership; the Seattle Mariners’ ownership group includes a significant Japanese presence.

McCourt has spoken with at least two other groups about a sale of some portion of the Dodgers and could use the $1.2 billion as a minimum value in those discussions, said a person familiar with them but not authorized to talk about them publicly.

McCourt also could cite the offer in Bankruptcy Court to counter MLB claims he has irreparably mismanaged the team.

Advertisement

It is uncertain whether sale discussions with any group might explain why McCourt’s attorneys have yet to pursue the cable television rights sale that they said would be the key to getting the Dodgers out of Bankruptcy Court.

Bruce Bennett, the Dodgers’ lead bankruptcy attorney, had promised to move forward on the issue at an Aug. 16 court hearing but did not do so. Fox Sports has threatened to sue for damages if the Dodgers void the two years remaining on the current cable contract to pursue a new one.

McCourt has discussed the sale of at least a partial share of the Dodgers with at least two other groups, said a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. It is unlikely Selig would sanction any deal that did not include an exit path for McCourt, but McCourt has signaled his intent to challenge Selig’s authority in court.

The record sale price for a major league franchise is $845 million, set two years ago when the Ricketts family bought the Chicago Cubs from Tribune Co., publisher of The Times.

That deal included the team, Wrigley Field and a 25% stake in a cable sports channel. The Burke group proposes paying almost half again as much for the Dodgers, their stadium and a chance to start a cable sports channel or negotiate a new cable television contact.

Despite the Forbes estimate, the team could be worth from $900 million to $1.1 billion, said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd, a Chicago-based sports industry consulting firm.

But with Fox at risk of losing the Dodgers to rival Time Warner’s fledgling Lakers channel, the bidding on the TV rights could be so robust that the team itself could fetch $1.2 billion or more in “a full-fledged auction” in Bankruptcy Court, said a prominent sports investment banker, who declined to be identified because he could represent potential bidders for the Dodgers.

Burke sold the Los Angeles Marathon in 2004, building the race into one of the largest in the United States but jousting with city officials in various financial skirmishes, including disputes over reimbursement for city services and ownership of the L.A. Marathon name. Burke is the husband of retired Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.

Burke sold the race to Devine Racing. In 2008, Devine sold the marathon to McCourt.

417,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Drought exacerbates situation for conflict-affected farmers in Afghanistan - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/drought-exacerbates-situation-conflict-affected-farmers-afghanistan,"15/08/2018 Afghanistan is experiencing one of the world’s most complex humanitarian emergencies. Ongoing conflict, natural disasters, internal displacement and cross-border movements continue to increase food insecurity. This year, farmers are also suffering from a drought that is affecting the majority of the country.

Ahmadullah lives in Burj, a village in Zairy District, Kandahar. Like many Afghans, he is a smallholder farmer who owns livestock and grows fruit on his small plot of land. Drought has caused his gardens to dry out and many of his crops to fail. His animals are not breeding, and he has had to sell many of them. All his neighbours are in the same boat. They cannot afford to buy livestock feed due to drought-induced price increases, so their only viable option is selling meat at low prices.

Ahmadullah and his neighbours received animal feed as part of a FAO drought-mitigation project in Kandahar, one of the most drought-stricken provinces in the country.

Many farmers are coping with the drought by digging deeper tube wells to source both drinking and irrigation water. However, this is not a sustainable strategy. Deeper wells just mean that groundwater is becoming depleted faster. Such short-term coping techniques, coupled with the near-yearly droughts of the past two decades, mean that underground aquifers are emptier than ever before. Farmers know this strategy is not going to keep working in the long run. They know less rain is falling, they see river flows decrease, and they watch mountain snow cover shrink with each passing year.

Accessing food and water has always been a struggle for Ahmadullah’s family. “Since the time the Taliban were ruling, I’ve often had to borrow money from relatives and friends in order to get enough to eat,” he said. “I’m worried we will have to do the same this year, or worse – we could have to move. But, with so many provinces suffering from drought, I don’t know where we’d go.”

With droughts happening so frequently, farmers barely have time to recover before the next one hits. High temperatures this year in parts of the country have also made the current drought particularly punishing. Decades of war have destroyed much of Afghanistan's irrigation infrastructure. Without timely rebuilding of proper irrigation systems, many farmers fear they will not be able to go back to farming and ultimately lose their main source of livelihood.",2018-08-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['situation', 'water', 'conflictaffected', 'strategy', 'drought', 'suffering', 'afghanistan', 'irrigation', 'wells', 'provinces', 'source', 'exacerbates', 'know', 'farmers']",Afghanistan,news article,English
1824,FL-2021-000038-KEN,"1.4 million starving in Northern Kenya, says Red Cross - The Star, Kenya",https://www.the-star.co.ke/counties/north-eastern/2021-04-19-14-million-starving-in-northern-kenya-says-red-cross/,"At least 1.4 million people are surviving on donated food in Northern Kenya because of drought.

The situation could last until end of the year, based on the current weather forecast. The drought is a result of the La Nina dry weather.

Kenya Red Cross Society predicts the situation could stabilise from October only if the short rains season will bring adequate rainfall.

On Friday, Red Cross appealed for Sh800 million to reach both drought-hit Kenyans and another 30,000 people facing floods in Western Kenya.

“We are dealing with two natural disasters that essentially should be mutually exclusive—drought in one region and flooding in the other,” Red Cross secretary-general Asha Mohammed said.

According to the Met Department, the current heavy rains in Western Kenya will not reach most parts of northeastern Kenya.

In an interview with the Star, Asha said the current drought condition is worse than last year.

“It's, unfortunately, worse because it has been compounded by Covid-19. When people in towns have lost jobs, they cannot remit money to relatives upcountry. So it’s not just people being unable to grow food, but also the purchasing power of people has been reduced yet the food prices have increased,” she said.

She explained why a bumper harvest in the Western region often does not alleviate the food shortage in Northern Kenya.

Asha said while food distribution is one problem, different parts of Kenya consume varying types of food.

“For example, maize and beans is not acceptable in some communities,” she noted.

In the appeal, Red Cross said Sh483 million will go to flood victims while Sh315 million will buy food for drought victims.

She said the projections show that between 15,000 and 30,000 families around Lake Victoria will be displaced by the ongoing heavy rains and will need shelter, food, clean water and basic healthcare.

According to the Kenya Meteorological Department, while Western, Rift Valley, Coast and Central Kenya will have enhanced rainfall this season, rainfall in Northern Kenya will be depressed.

Red Cross says this time everyone is affected by the drought, as opposed to just women and children in the past.

“Again, I would blame Covid because a lot of the men today have lost jobs. They have gone back to the rural area and they all just live there with their families. So we are targeting entire families.”

She also emphasised early warning systems as being more effective than waiting for emergency responses.

These include advising people to move to higher grounds in flood-prone areas and also digging boreholes in drought-hit regions.

The society is coordinating with Somalia and Ethiopia, which are also facing a prolonged drought.

“We are talking together as counterparts from Somalia and Ethiopia. We are talking with our [global] secretary to also to see how we can support the Somali Red Crescent and people in Somalia because even in 2011, very many people came from Somalia because of the drought and crossed over into Kenya,” she said.

944,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Somalia and Gaza will miss Eid celebrations | Editorials – Gulf News - gulfnews.com,https://gulfnews.com/opinion/editorials/somalia-and-gaza-will-miss-eid-celebrations-1.858308,"As millions of Muslims around the world prepare to celebrate the joys of Eid Al Fitr, a couple of areas will miss out on these celebrations. The people in Gaza and the Horn of Africa will not be part of the celebrations — not by choice but by circumstance. Hence, it is important that they receive the maximum support and help that they need.

The facts and figures on the situation in the Horn of Africa are shocking and striking. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that the number of people affected by the food shortages has increased from 10 million to 12.4 million. In addition, children are gravely affected by the situation with about 2.3 million acutely malnourished according to the Unicef.

The situation is in fact bleak, as Unicef says that more than half a million of those children face the risk of death if immediate intervention is not pursued. There is no doubt that the drought seen in Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Ethiopia is the worst that these countries have faced in 60 years. And the prediction is that this situation will not improve any time soon — rather the drought conditions for the next months will take a turn for the worse.

The situation in Gaza is also miserable as Palestinians face daily challenges with their attempts to go on with daily life that is as normal as it could be. But how can this be possible when Israel continues with its iron-fisted rule? Israel conducts on-and-off attacks on Gaza and Palestinians are left to accept living with the minimum of the basic needs that they require.

587,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought in other habitats makes greater flamingos stay longer at Okhla sanctuary - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/drought-in-other-habitats-makes-greater-flamingos-stay-longer-at-okhla-sanctuary/story-5oCJhGDwLB65S1s6iowIWL.html,"The waters of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary have taken on a blush of colour, one that has been lingering longer than usual, with the greater flamingos deciding to stay put, the longest they have done so in the sanctuary so far.

The flamboyance of flamingos, from Kutch and Rajasthan, started reaching the Okhla sanctuary from November onwards for roosting and feeding. Their white plumage have taken on a near-perfect pink sheen — a sign that they have been getting good feed— rich algae and phytoplankton.

The reason for their prolonged stay, according to foresters and ornithologists, is the lack of water and drought-like situation at their alternative sites, in Rajasthan and elsewhere across the NCR, where the Greater flamingos species often roosts annually.

Currently, the shallow southeastern and the mid-yamuna region of the sanctuary are home to the flamboyance of about 150 to 200 greater flamingos, offering a breathtaking view of the blush pink birds against the blue-grey water this far out in June.

According to forest officials, the last such sighting was in May 2016-17, which came after the drought of 2015-16.

“This year, as lots of places such as Rajasthan have no water, the flamingos, which often search for shallow water where they can wade, couldn’t find places to roost. Okhla is one of the few options left for them in the region,” Neeta Shah, principal scientist, and flamingo expert at Bombay Natural History Society, told HT.

She said the salinity in the water of river Yamuna due to the pollution and the temporary influx of fresh water could have created the right conditions for algae and planktons to grow, and these are what flamingos feed on.

Greater flamingos are native to the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Sri Lanka, and adapt well to the higher temperatures in these regions.

The distinguishing feature of the greater flamingos is the pinkish-white plumage. Their wing coverts are mostly red, while the primary and secondary flight feathers are black. Forest officials said the birds have a pink bill with a black tip, and legs that are entirely pink. Their call is called a murmur, a bit like the honk of a goose.

According to the experts, after feeding in the shallow waters, they head back for breeding to Kutch in Gujarat, while a few make a beeline to Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan, and others to South Africa and Sri Lanka.

“Their major breeding ground is Kutch, like Vachharaj Bet in Little Rann of Kutch and Hanjado Bet in Great Rann of Kutch. They migrate elsewhere temporarily for food. Most of the northern region receive the birds that breed in Kutch and Rajasthan. The coastal areas and habitats such as Sewri in Maharashtra receive flocks from South Africa while Point Calimer in Tamil Nadu gets migrants from Sri Lanka,” Ashish Prashad, senior researcher and a flamingo expert at Wildlife Institute of India, said.

Known for nesting on mudflats (which are surrounded by water and also act as the first line of defence against predators) the greater flamingos breed from around June-end to August-end and lay eggs around October.

“If the region gets a good rain during monsoon, the greater flamingos also breed twice a year,” Shah said.

Experts pointed out that the pink plumage of the flamingoes, which appears after a good feed of algae, later helps the male attract females for breeding.

The species, except the birds with chicks, migrate to temporary habitats from November

“The greater flamingos have turned up in good numbers. It has been two years since we saw them in Okhla in such great numbers. Last year, the flamingos had given the sanctuary a miss,” Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, said.

There are several hot spots of flamingos in India, with around six wetlands in the NCR that attract the greater flamingos to roost, experts said. However, of those six wetlands, it’s only the Okhla Bird Sanctuary and the Najafgarh Jheel where the birds are still being sighted.

“They are filter feeders. They stand in the shallow waters, dip their heads in the water and rake up the soil and then hold up their heads to filter their food by seeping out the waste through their beaks. So the richness of food is one factor for why they are staying put in Okhla,” Rahul Kaul of Wildlife Trust of India said. He added that not all flamingos breed, and given the present scenario, some juveniles might stay back even longer.

According to experts, it is, however, not a reason to rejoice as their prolonged stay also indicates that the wetlands elsewhere are in a bad shape.

“I would call this aberrant behaviour and not something to rejoice about, because by this time, they should be gone. But they are staying back and that indicates that other wetlands are in a poor shape or are being encroached upon as is the case with Basai near Gurugram,” eminent birdwatcher Bikram Grewal said.

Speaking of their local habitats, conservationist Ananda Banerjee also raised concerns over the lack of study on the local habitats of the flamingos and the algae, despite there being a healthy presence of both in the region.

“Okhla and Najafgarh are temporary microhabitats of the flamingos. They don’t breed here but migrate from one habitat to another to roost. But in case there is not enough water, they will naturally go where they can. However, there are no studies on the quality of algae which may affect these birds and their numbers in the long run,” Banerjee said.

According to bird expert Anand Arya, some of the prime habitats of greater flamingos are Okhla, Najafgarh, Dhanauri, Sultanpur, Jhajjhar, and Basai. However, sighting happens majorly in Okhla and Najafgarh.

“The Dadri wetland has been destroyed and the last sighting there was in 2009,” Arya, who lives in Noida, said.",2019-06-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['makes', 'greater', 'sanctuary', 'rajasthan', 'water', 'okhla', 'drought', 'stay', 'longer', 'habitats', 'flamingos', 'kutch', 'pink', 'birds']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
499,DR-2021-000054-SOM,"Triple threat of drought, COVID-19 and insecurity in Mogadishu driving severe humanitarian need in Somalia, warns IRC - International Rescue Committee",https://www.rescue.org/press-release/triple-threat-drought-covid-19-and-insecurity-mogadishu-driving-severe-humanitarian,"Following a declaration of drought from the Government of Somalia, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is concerned about the increasing humanitarian need in the country, especially exacerbated by a precarious security situation and surging COVID-19 cases. In the last month alone, Somalia has seen a 48% increase in deaths from COVID-19 and a doubling of confirmed cases from 6687 to 13,812 cases in the last 59 days. Recent conflict in Mogadishu has been hampering humanitarian service delivery and will drive further need if the security situation deteriorates as more people become displaced.

Richard Crothers, IRC Somalia Country Director said:

“Over 80% of the country is suffering from drought conditions, cattle and crops are dying as the frequency of climate-related hazards increase. We’ve seen a spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths over the last month, with many cases going undetected and untested. In a country already suffering from severe humanitarian crises, with almost 6 million people in need, the drought will drive even more displacement and food insecurity. Now more than ever we need an increase in support and funding in order to meet the rising humanitarian need.”

Since 1990, Somalia has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. These climate related shocks resulted in Somalia’s highest number of newly internally displaced people over the past three years at 1.2 million displaced people in 2020, compared to 884,000 in 2018 and 770,000 in 2019. In total, more than 2.6 million people are internally displaced – all of whom continue to face serious risks of marginalization, forced eviction and exclusion. With the Humanitarian Response Plan severely underfunded, standing at just 15% funded, the international community must scale up its response and invest in early action and resilience programs now if we are to avert a major humanitarian disaster.

The IRC is already operational in the main areas of concern including Mogadishu, Puntland and central Somalia, and is significantly scaling up our programming to support families with healthcare for malnourished children, unconditional cash transfers to help people quickly get the support they need, rehabilitation of boreholes and water sources as well as mobile health services to reach deeper into hard hit areas.

853,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,African youth pledge to combat Climate change - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/african-youth-pledge-to-combat-climate-change/,"Climate change has been the one of the greatest challenges facing Africa today, specially the Sahel.

It is obvious that, the fight against climate change requires strong involvement of African youth, international and regional cooperation.

It is in this regard, for two days, on 7and 8 July, 150 youth leaders from across Sub-saharan Africa and Niger itself gathered during the African Union Summit in Niamey and pledged to take all necessary measures to fight against the negative impact of climate change initially in the Sahel and ultimately across Africa.

Organized by the African Renaissance and Diaspora Network (ARDN) jointly with the Ministry of Environment of Niger, with the technical and financial support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Fund for Populations Activities (UNFPA), the Universal Peace Federation International (UPF), the event pulled together youth leaders who are members of the Youth Leaders Network of the United Nations for the SDGs (ROJALNU-ODD).

The Young African Leaders Summit on Climate Change is a platform for dialogue on thematic issues at the center of the global climate debate, bringing together promising young Africans on climate change issues.

It also created opportunities for the preparation and financing of a project on the implementation of the initiative “A Greener Africa, Youth and Climate Change» with a focus on regreening the Sahel, youth employment, the fight against ecological migration, the increased role of local authorities and the private sector.

The Niamey meeting was officially opened by the Minister of the Environment, Urban Sanitation and Sustainable Development Almoustapha Garba.

Apart from the 150-youth mentioned above, participants included members of the ARDN Board of Directors, the Ambassador of the United States Mr. Eric Whitaker, representatives of UNDP and other UN Agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector and the academic world.

According to Mr. Garba, responding to the challenges of climate change requires strong involvement of African youth, international and regional cooperation.

” Indeed, the most visible manifestations of the adverse effects of climate change and variability on our biophysical and social environment are, among others, droughts, the degradation of our natural resources, the accentuation of the phenomenon of migration, terrorism.

Judging the effects of these changes therefore requires a full commitment of countries to finance adaptation measures to reduce pollutant emissions, “Garba said.

Responding to the expectations of the participants, Dr Djibril Diallo, President and CEO of ARDN, welcomed the strong presence of young people, the involvement of the Ministry of the Environment and other collaborators for the success of the Niamey meeting.

In this perspective, he also met each representative of ROJALNU to better accompany them once in their respective countries.

“One of our priority actions at ARDN is to engage the leadership and enthusiasm of the youth as entry point towards popularizing the Sustainable Development Goals in Africa and its diaspora.

The 33rd Summit of Heads of State of the African Union provided an excellent opportunity to spread our message to give the opportunity to the young people who are the future of Africa, “said Dr Djibril.

ROJALNU Secretary General Alioune Gueye thanked the Minister of the Environment, ARDN and the organizing committee for allowing the young people to participate in the event.

During the work, the young people exchanged and shared good practices around three themes highlighting the role of young people, women, mayors and local communities, private initiative in the fight against climate change.

“We are very happy to participate in this meeting and to be able to exchange with our fathers to take together concrete actions in the fight against climate change in Africa.

As members of the human family, we pledge to take due account of the actions we take on a daily basis to minimize, prevent and combat climate change and its negative effects, Alioune Gueye added.

The Niamey Youth Leadership gathering ended with the adoption of the Niamey Declaration which contains deliverables that the youth can work upon on their return to their countries

of origin.

It will also be presented to the annual event of the African Renaissance and Diaspora Network on 25 September in New York.",2019-07-20 07:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'pledge', 'niamey', 'youth', 'fight', 'african', 'change', 'young', 'environment', 'climate', 'ardn', 'combat']",Ghana,news article,English
614,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought drives mungbean production to 20-year low - Grain Central,https://www.graincentral.com/cropping/pulses/drought-drives-mungbean-production-to-20-year-low/,"MUNGBEAN production in eastern Australia has taken a hit from the drought with the planting area down about 50 per cent and harvest tonnages the lowest in two decades.

Australian Mungbean Association president Mark Schmidt said at the start of the year the association estimated about 50,000 hectares of mungbeans were planted.

But of that, only 40,000ha have been or will be harvested with at least 10,000ha wiped out by drought.

“The area planted is about 50 to 100 per cent smaller than normal. Normally we would expect about 100,000ha to be planted. Our biggest year was about 150,000ha,” he said.

“New South Wales didn’t get much planted at all and there were very limited plantings in Central Queensland.

“Of the 40,000ha harvested, we are expecting a yield of between 0.3 to 0.5 tonnes/ha. That would equate to an estimate of about 20,000 tonnes at this stage for the total mungbean crop. 20,000t is the lowest we have seen in 20 years.”

Mr Schmidt said this year’s crops were very small, but at least the modern-day varieties which had pods towards the top of the plant allowed the crops to be harvested.

“If we went back to the older varieties of 10 years ago, nothing would have survived. But the current varieties have proven to be so tough with the pods on top that people have been able to harvest them,” he said.

“It has been a tribute to the professionalism of the mungbean growers to be able to grow on stored moisture and harvest a crop that has basically had no in-crop rain.”

Mr Schmidt said prices at the start of the season were around $1100/t, but growers with high quality beans were now achieving up to $1500/t.

“Anyone who has really good quality mungbeans are getting up around $1500/t, but the range is $1100 to $1500/t,” he said.

Mr Schmidt said it was now too late for further mungbean plantings, except for some out-of-season production in the Burdekin region of far north Queensland where planting will start at the beginning of April.

He said recent late rain in some growing areas would benefit later planted crops which were flowering.

“Even some of the crops that were ready to harvest have reflowered and it will increase the yield. So, we might end up with more than the 20,000t,” he said.

The Australian Mungbean Association will hold its annual field walk at the Hermitage Research Facility, Warwick, Qld, from 7.30-12.00 on Thursday, April 4, 2019. RSVP [email protected]

The fate of Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah is set to be decided by Monday after failing to end the country’s trophy drought at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.



The Ghana FA Normalisation Committee is expected to submit its reports to the Sport Ministry today on the team’s disappointing campaign in Egypt.



The Black Stars exited the continental showpiece at the round of 16 stage at the hands of Tunisia.



The last 16 elimination is the country’s worst performance in the tournament since 2006.



In January this year, President of the committee Dr Kofi Amoah dropped hint that Appiah’s head would be on the chopping board if the Black Stars miss out on the trophy.



“Per the contract, if Kwesi Appiah doesn’t win the AFCON 2019 he is gone. This is stated in his contract,” Amoah was quoted as saying.



Coach Appiah still has a running contract which will expire in December.

For all the billions of dollars spent since the Taliban were ousted in 2001, Afghanistan remains a desperately poor country, lacking basic infrastructure, including electricity and paved roads across most of its territory.

Struggling after decades of war, Afghanistan is now facing an acute food shortage in many regions, with 2.6 million people enduring emergency-level food insecurity, one stage short of outright famine, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.

With his crops failing and his animals dying of thirst, Mahiuddin left Kolari village, in an area under Taliban control, for the more stable province of Herat, joining some 223,000 people displaced in western Afghanistan.

""We were forced to leave our home due to drought. We had no food to eat and no water to drink,"" Mahiuddin said. ""We have lost everything and if we go back to Badghis, what should we do there, since everything is lost?""

The exodus underlines the deep environmental problems facing Afghanistan, much of which consists of dry, rugged and inhospitable terrain subject at various times to both drought and deadly flash floods made worse by deforestation.

International aid groups say that without urgent help, 10.6 million people, more than a quarter of Afghanistan's population, could be ""food insecure"" by next year, with 2.9 million facing emergency-level insecurity.

With much of Afghanistan's agricultural land degraded, and many areas lawless after years of war, food insecurity has added to the suffering without generating the same headlines as the fighting.

Although Herat is one of Afghanistan's more prosperous cities, it cannot provide work for the tens of thousands of new arrivals and its infrastructure is under increasing strain, officials say.

""Drinking water will be a problem next year if the situation does not improve,"" said Herat governor Mohammad Asif Rahimi.

""Herat cannot deal with 50,000 families coming next year.""

COLD KILLS

Aid groups provide emergency assistance of 6,000 afghani($80) for immediate needs as well as help with cooking equipment, tents, tarpaulins and fuel but the thousands camped out in settlements are looking forward with apprehension to the harsh winter months ahead.

""The tent is so cold and I have two small children,"" said Abdul Wakil from the northern province of Faryab, who arrived four months ago at a camp outside Herat.

""I turn to one side to warm up and then turn to warm the other.""

Already the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has reported the first deaths among displaced children because of the cold in Herat and Badghis.

Officials say relief efforts have been hampered by a lack of coordination between central and local government and aid organisations, with displaced people spread out over 10 main camps and dozens of smaller settlements around Herat.

""A lot of people have been displaced and all of them are needy,"" said Ahmad Jawid Nadem, head of the local department of refugees and repatriation, who said resources had been badly strained by the thousands of arrivals.

""Our food stocks are empty and we have asked the central government to provide us assistance. Once we receive help from the central government, we will distribute food to displaced people,"" he said.

Mozambique is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to natural disasters and climate change.

The severe food shortage is taking a heavy toll, especially on children under the age of five years, with some 67,500 children facing acute malnutrition. Crops are failing; communities do not have enough food to eat, and cannot produce enough to sell. There is a high risk of negative coping mechanisms. The country is still reeling from the devastating effects of two major cyclones, Cyclone Idai in the central-eastern parts, and Cyclone Kenneth in the northern parts of the country, which hit the country earlier this year.

In response, CARE is planning to distribute drought-resistant seeds and tools, as well as deliver basic training in improved agricultural practices to combat the effects of the climate crisis, in several districts of Sofala and Inhambane provinces.

About CARE in Mozambique:

CARE began working in Mozambique in 1984 delivering emergency and large-scale humanitarian assistance to communities affected by the protracted war between the government and rebel forces. Since the end of the war in 1992, CARE has been addressing the needs of people in the areas of health, water and sanitation, agriculture as well as economic empowerment and food assistance. One of CARE‘s major focus areas is the empowerment of women and girls and strengthening local civil society action. As part of our historic focus on emergency response, we are now engaging more on disaster risk reduction and climate change.

About CARE

When flooding ravaged parts of southern Alberta in 2013, banks and other lenders took notice.

“We would be asked on every deal, ‘Is it in the flood zone?'” Mike Boyle, president of Calgary-based The Mortgage Group, told Global News.

Lenders didn’t want to get involved with addresses that turned out to be in the disaster areas, he recalled.

Six years later, with the flood a “distant memory,” that’s no longer an issue, according to Boyle. But he worries about homeowners in regions like southeastern Ontario and Quebec, where rivers seem to be overflowing with alarming regularity.

“You can’t get a mortgage if you can’t get insurance,” he said.

Speaking from the Ottawa-Gatineau area, which is experiencing its second major flood in the span of 24 months, licensed insolvency trustee John Haralovich shares the same concern.

“We have seen lenders not agree to renew the mortgage,” said Haralovich, a senior vice-president at debt consultancy firm MNP.

Those have been rare cases so far, he said, but that could change.

“In 2017, they said (the flood) was a once-in-100-year occurrence, and two years later, it’s happened again,” he said.

Homeowners who discover they can’t continue their insurance coverage may also hear from banks that they won’t keep servicing their mortgage once it comes up for renewal, he added. With no insurance to protect the collateral, mortgages on homes in flood-prone areas may become too risky for mainstream lenders, he said.

Several experts who spoke to Global News are concerned that a growing number of Canadians may find themselves facing this issue after the latest round of spring flooding.

The trouble with overland flood insurance

Some 1.7 million Canadian households, or roughly 20 per cent of the population, are exposed to the risk of so-called overland flooding, in which the water flows in from windows, doors and cracks in the walls, usually from an overflowing river or lake.

The good news for them is that overland flood insurance, which didn’t exist for residential dwellings during the 2013 Alberta floods, is now increasingly available in Canada.

The bad news is that no kind of private insurance is meant to cover homeowners from natural disasters that keep happening.

READ MORE: ‘You have a fear of more rain’ — Flooding haunts homeowners for years, study finds

Between eight and 10 per cent of Canadian homeowners live in areas where the likelihood of recurrent flooding is so high that insurance coverage is not available or would come at an “outrageous” cost, Robert Harrison, chairman of the Insurance Brokers Association of Canada, told Canadian Underwriter.

Story continues below advertisement

But even homeowners who have been able to buy overland flood coverage can’t necessarily rest easy. If they ever make a claim on that coverage, it is “entirely possible” that they will see their coverage reduced or their insurance costs increased at renewal, said Anne Marie Thomas of InsuranceHotline.com. And if there is a high enough risk that they will be flooded again, they may not be able to continue their coverage at all, she added.

Insurance is meant for events that are “sudden and accidental,” said Pete Karageorgos of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

“You don’t necessarily meet that threshold … if you’re living in a floodplain and odds are it may flood again,” he said.

Canadians who have another type of flood coverage called sewer backup insurance also face a similar conundrum. Filing a claim because backed-up city pipes caused water to flow back into your basement may cause your insurance provider to rethink the terms of your policy when its term is up.

Story continues below advertisement

But homeowners dealing with a flooded basement can take several steps to help limit the risk and extent of future water damage and keep their insurance company happy, Thomas said. That includes measures such as installing a sump pump, which helps pump out water accumulating under your home, or a backwater valve, which prevents water in sewage pipes from backing into your house.

Those measures, though, only go so far when you have water breaking in through your windows and doors from nearby rivers and lakes, Thomas said.

“You can’t stop Mother Nature,” she said.

Floods, mortgages and bankruptcies

Eventually, floods can lead to debt defaults, Haralovich said.

Story continues below advertisement

Lenders’ refusal to renew mortgages, of course, is one potential trigger. If homeowners are asked to pay off their outstanding mortgage balance and can’t cover those costs by selling their property, they may have no choice but to default.

Another plausible scenario is that they would be able to turn to alternative lenders, which take on riskier loans but also charge higher interest. That may be a temporary solution, but over time, higher mortgage costs could still push homeowners into debt restructuring, Haralovich said.

A third possible driver is repair bills.

Haralovich recalled seeing one family after the 2017 flood who was forced to file a consumer proposal, despite having some flood insurance.

The policy didn’t cover all the costs so the family used credit cards to finance the rest of the repairs. Within a few months, according to Haralovich, the bills and credit charges had spiralled out of control.

“There is an emerging risk facing Canada’s mortgage market, where flood-related mortgage arrears may become more frequent following flood events as saving rates remain low and more households are subject to repeated flooding,” reads a report by Natalia Moudrak and Blair Feltmate of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

That risk exists for sewer backup flooding, too. The average cost of a flooded basement is $43,000, while available insurance coverage is sometimes capped at less than half that in certain areas, Feltmate previously told Global News.

Meanwhile, surveys show almost half of working Canadians live paycheque to paycheque, the Intact study noted.

Where is the government?

For years, the expansion of the private flood insurance market after the Alberta floods coincided with an attempt by various levels of government to curtail their own responsibility toward property owners, according to Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor at the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development at the University of Waterloo.

Story continues below advertisement

In 2016, for example, British Columbia announced that applicants for disaster financial assistance who could “reasonably and readily” have purchased overland flood insurance would not be eligible to receive the government aid.

The idea was that promoting insurance coverage would help contain the flood-related costs borne by taxpayers. But private insurance alone is ill-suited to protect property owners in areas with a high risk of repeated flooding, Thistlethwaite noted.

READ MORE: ‘This is a huge shock to us’ — What climate change means for home insurance

“This lack of insurance availability in high-risk areas is likely to undermine the federal government’s goal of reducing the costs of publicly funded disaster assistance,” he predicted in a paper co-authored with Daniel Henstra for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

That realization seems to have dawned on the government now.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that residents in some areas will have to “move or rebuild differently,” while Quebec Premier François Legault has spoken about paying $200,000 for homeowners in the Ottawa River floodplain to move away from the area.

READ MORE: How Canadians can assist flooding victims in Ontario, Quebec and N.B.

Buyouts have also been a topic of discussion in formal talks between Ottawa and provincial governments. Efforts are also underway to draw or update flood-risk maps. And policy-makers are speaking with insurers about creating a flood-risk insurance pool to fund coverage in flood-prone areas. Insurance companies would set aside part of the revenues to offer subsidized coverage in these areas in a model similar to what is used in Canada to offer auto-insurance coverage to high-risk drivers, Thistlethwaite said.

It makes for a stark contrast to the narrative politicians were using in the aftermath of the Alberta floods, in which the emphasis was on restoring things to the way they were before, Thistlethwaite said.

Now, he added, the language has changed.

Not since 2014 has Egypt seen this amount of fake news items than it did in 2020, thanks to the coronavirus. Rumours about the pandemic made up 51.8 percent of the false news circulated in Egypt throughout the year, read a report released on Monday by the cabinet’s media centre.

And not that warnings of legal action succeeded in putting the brakes on the generation of rumours. Egypt’s general prosecution warned in late March against spreading fake news and rumours about the coronavirus, saying the act is punishable by jail sentences and fines of up to EGP 20,000.

The finance sector was the most hit by rumors in January 2020, and the health sector won the lion’s share throughout the following six months as the pandemic broke out in Egypt in mid-February.

According to the cabinet's report, the health sector was the most hit by rumours in 2020 with 24.1 percent, followed by the education and finance sectors.

Rumors hit many other fields, including supply, agriculture, housing, tourism and antiquities, social solidarity, fuel and electricity, and administrative reform, the report read.

The report detailed the most serious rumours generated in 2020, dividing them into “most serious,” “strangest,” “repetitive” and “rumours aiming to distort achievements.”

Most serious rumours

- Coronavirus patients undergo kidney dialysis along with other kidney patients in governmental hospitals.

- There is a shortage in equipment and supplies in Intensive Care Units in governmental hospitals.

- Some face masks made of non-medical materials are distributed in quarantine hospitals.

- Medical waste of quarantine hospitals is disposed of in an unsafe way.

- Some people donating blood in governmental hospitals contracted coronavirus.

- The government hanged banners with the phrase “Al-Khatar Yaqtareb” (Danger is nearing) to intimidate citizens.

- A shipment of meat contaminated with coronavirus was imported.

- The Ministry of Health is using the vaccines of Tuberculosis (TB) and Measles to vaccinate people against the coronavirus.

- Meningitis spread in various governorates.

- All fire extinguishers nationwide are unusable.

Strangest rumours

- Bodies of coronavirus victims are being burnt.

- The issuance of marriage contracts was suspended for a year starting July 2020.

- Fresh graduates of medical schools will be assigned nursing duties.

- Fees will be imposed on students to enter universities.

1558,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt Photos: Sun lights up the face of Ramses II in Abu Simbel in biannual illumination - Egypt Independent,https://egyptindependent.com/photos-sun-lights-up-the-face-of-ramses-ii-in-abu-simbel-in-biannual-illumination/,"Thursday morning, a rare solar alignment caused the sun to shine on the face of King Ramses II in Aswan’s Abu Simbel temple for 20 minutes, announcing the beginning of Egypt’s flood and growing season.

This unique phenomenon takes place just twice a year—once on October 22 to mark the king’s birthday and the beginning of the growing season, and again on February 22 to celebrate his coronation and the start of harvest season.

On these two days, the temple opens its doors for tourists at 3 am in order to facilitate viewings of this special occurrence, which lasts for just 20 minutes.

Thousands of tourists line up in what is known as the country’s “longest tourist queue” in order to witness the sunlight penetrate sixty meters into the temple, lighting up the king’s face.

The sun also shines on statues of the sun gods Re-Horakhte and Amon-Re, seated next to Ramses II. The statues sit in the company of the Theban god of darkness, Ptah, who remains in the shadows all year.

Ramses II was the third pharaoh of Egypt’s 19th Dynasty. He is regarded as the most powerful and celebrated pharaoh of Egypt, and was the husband of the famous Queen Nefertari.

The king was responsible for numerous military campaigns that expanded the empire, as well as the construction of temples and statues throughout the region.",2020-10-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['face', 'ramses', 'statues', 'pharaoh', 'growing', 'temple', 'simbel', 'photos', 'illumination', 'ii', 'abu', 'kings', 'king', 'order', 'tourists', 'lights', 'biannual']",Egypt,news article,English
1580,FL-2020-000038-EGY,"Floods, Drought Are Destroying Crops and Sparking Food Inflation - Claims Journal",https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/international/2020/10/23/300118.htm,"Wild weather is wreaking havoc on crops around the world, sending their prices skyrocketing.

On wheat farms in the U.S. and Russia, it’s a drought that’s ruining harvests. The soybean fields of Brazil are bone dry too, touched by little more than the occasional shower. In Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, the problem is the exact opposite. Torrential downpours are causing flooding in rice fields and stands of oil palm trees.

The sudden emergence of these supply strains is a big blow to a global economy that has been struggling to regain its footing after the shock of the Covid-19 lockdowns. As prices soar on everything from sugar to cooking oil, millions of working-class families that had already been forced to scale back food purchases in the pandemic are being thrust deeper into financial distress.

What’s more, these increases threaten to push up broader inflation indexes in some countries and could make it harder for central bankers to keep providing monetary stimulus to shore up growth.

The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index, a gauge of nine crop prices, has risen 28% since late April to its highest level in more than four years. Wheat earlier this week was the most expensive since 2014.

“The fundamentals have changed dramatically since May,” said Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities in Iowa. “The weather is bubbling to the top, and we have demand chugging in a bull market.”

The fallout from the pandemic means that the United Nations was already warning of a worst-case scenario in which about a tenth of the world’s population would go hungry this year. Things could become more dire if grocery costs keep rising and even more people can’t afford to eat.

“It’s looking very bleak,” said David Beasley, executive director at the World Food Programme, the hunger-fighting group that won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Declining currencies in food-importing nations, the threat of more economic shutdowns and struggles for farmers to expand production could all compound the problem, he said.

“You start adding all these things together and you begin to almost run around like, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’ but it ain’t chicken little,” Beasley said.

Mangled supply chains and a flood of buying already sent food prices higher in many countries earlier this year as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted global trade. But even then, there was an ample cushion of grain stockpiles and Northern Hemisphere harvests were expected to be bountiful. Then came the dry weather.

Climate scientists have long warned that an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather patterns would be a growing threat to crop production and food security. Now, we are experiencing what it means to be living in a climate-disrupted world as wildfires blaze across the U.S. West, hurricane season grows more ferocious and forecasters say that 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record.

Antonio Carlos Simoneti, a fourth-generation orange grower in Brazil, is seeing the change firsthand. With drought and heat plaguing his lands in Sao Paulo state, the world’s top region for orange juice production, the river that usually snakes across his property has vanished. That’s the first time that’s happened since his family acquired the farm 36 years ago. Oranges on his 500-hectare (1,236-acre) grove are drying up inside and becoming crystallized, as the trees suck all the water from the fruit to try to survive the parched conditions.

After making some sales earlier in the season, “I don’t have more fruits to sell,” said Simoneti, who expects his harvest to drop about 50% this year because of the weather. “What remains on the trees are dried, without water inside.”

Shopping Spree

It’s not just the weather sparking higher crop prices.

Agricultural commodity buyers from Cairo to Islamabad have been on a shopping spree as nations try to protect themselves from more disruptions to supply chains, like those seen earlier this year when lockdowns left food stranded at ports, sparked trucking delays and created logjams at warehouses.

A weaker real is boosting prices even further in agriculture superpower Brazil, where soybeans are up 81% and corn 56% this year, also raising costs for chicken and pork production. As an emergency measure, local government has temporarily removed import tariffs for soybeans, corn, rice and wheat to control food inflation.

Jordan has built up record wheat reserves while Egypt, the world’s top buyer of the grain, took the unusual step of tapping international markets during its local harvest and has boosted purchases by more than 50% since April. Taiwan said it will increase strategic food stockpiles and China has been buying to feed its growing hog herd.

The last protracted runup in food prices back in 2011 helped contribute to uprisings in the Arab Spring. That said, prices have a long way to climb before reaching those levels. Also, a bumper crop in Australia may help to fill the supply gap.

That growth in demand helps to explain why prices are moving higher despite a still-hefty inventory cushion. Global reserves of wheat, for example, are forecast to reach a record this year. Those supplies could eventually help to bring food inflation back in check if concerns over weather problems start to die down.

That would be welcome relief for people like Doan Cam Chi, a Ho Chi Minh City working mom. She estimated she’s spent about 30% more on food bills this year for her 5-member family. She’s seen pork prices decrease this month, but things like rice, cereals and fruits are still up from last year.

“I just can’t trim food expenses as my kids are in their growing years,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a market in the city, 50-year-old produce seller Le Thi Giang was just an hour away from closing on a recent morning, but her stall was still full of unsold spinach, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans and carrots. Ongoing torrential rains and flooding in key growing areas mean that prices for fruit and vegetables are fetching as much as double what they were pre-pandemic. At these higher costs, many people can’t afford to buy what they need for a healthy diet, she said.

“I have to call and invite people into my stall, something I had never done before,” said Giang, who has been selling at the market for two decades.

The recovery in prices after years in the doldrums has been welcome news for farmers in the U.S., who have relied more on government aid to balance the loss of income due to tariffs and trade wars.

“To see demand be so strong right now for a lot of commodities is a welcome sign,” Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer and chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, who grows corn and soybeans in southwest Iowa, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Right now exports are just on fire.”

According to the Director of Meteorological Services Stella Aura, the outlook for May 2021 indicates that several parts of the Lake Victoria Basin region and Western Kenya; Central and Southern Rift Valley are likely to experience slightly enhanced rainfall.

Counties in the southeastern and North-eastern are likely to receive near-average rainfall.

Counties in the Coastal region are likely to experience below-average rainfall.

The distribution of the rain is likely to be poor in the Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, and the Coastal region.

Rainfall is expected to continue during the month of May in the Lake Victoria Basin; Highlands West of the Rift Valley; and Central and South Rift Valley.

However, the rainfall amounts are expected to be above average during the first half of the month and near average during the second half of the month.

The rains will continue into the month of June.

Turkana, West Pokot, and Samburu counties are likely to be characterised by near to slightly above average rainfall during the first half of the month.

Occasional rainfall is likely to occur during the second half of the month. The expected total rainfall amounts are likely to be near the long-term average for the region.

Above-average rainfall is expected during the first half of the month in the Highlands East of the Rift Valley and Central Kenya.

The rain is likely to be conducive for agricultural production, especially in the high-potential counties in the Lake Victoria basin Region, Highlands West of the Rift Valley as well as Central and Southern Rift Valley.

There is a likelihood of flooding in low-lying areas and flood plains especially over the Western parts of Kenya where occasional rainfall is expected.

Cases of lightning strikes are still likely in the Lake Victoria Basin and highlands west of Rift Valley and landslides may occur in the hilly areas of the highlands west and east of the Rift Valley.

Rainfall performance in April

April marks the peak of the Long Rains (March-April-May) season.

The month began with dry weather conditions over several parts of the country except for the Lake basin, highlands west and east of the Rift valley where occasional rainfall was experienced.

The most enhanced rainfall of 337.7mm was recorded at Suba station. This was followed by Kisumu at 276.9mm, Kabete at 272.3mm, and Kakamega at 271.3mm.

Other stations that recorded more than 200 mm include Kericho, Kitui, Kisii, Dagoretti, Kangema, Embu, Thika, Wilson, and Moi Air Base.

790,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Lake goes dry in Chiapas' Metzabok lagoon system but cause unknown - Mexico News Daily,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/lake-goes-dry-in-chiapas-lagoon-system/,"A lake has run dry in the Lacandon Jungle in Chiapas but the cause of the phenomenon is unknown.

The now-empty lakebed is located in the eastern municipality of Ocosingo and part of the UNESCO-protected Metzabok lagoon system, which is considered sacred by the local Mayan people.

Local resident Armando Valenzuela said the lake dried up completely on Saturday night but water levels had been dropping during the previous two weeks.

“. . . The community was monitoring it to take care of the [wildlife] species,” he said.

Around 150 residents helped to transfer fish to other lakes in the area, the newspaper Reforma reported, although some ended up on dinner tables.

“There’s nothing left in what was a great expanse of water and a tourist site,” said one local in a video posted to social media.

Valenzuela said there are 10 smaller lakes in the area that dry up every year but it is the first time that a larger one has lost all its water.

Staff at the Natural Protected Areas Commission told Reforma that an investigation is underway to determine the cause.

Lower than usual rainfall appears to be the most likely culprit.

The National Meteorological Service said in May that land in the catchment area of the Usumacinta river, one of several waterways that feed the Metzabok lagoon system, was in a state of extreme drought.

2455,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Coastal flooding will disproportionately impact 31 million people globally - EurekAlert,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/iu-cfw100120.php,"Study is first to assess the impact of climate change on the global population of river deltas

Thirty-one million people living in river deltas are at high risk of experiencing flooding and other impacts from tropical cyclones and climate change, according to a study by Indiana University researchers.

""To date, no one has successfully quantified the global population on river deltas and assessed the cumulative impacts from climate change,"" said Douglas Edmonds, the Malcolm and Sylvia Boyce Chair in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and lead author on the study. ""Since river deltas have long been recognized as hotspots of population growth, and with increasing impacts from climate change, we realized we needed to properly quantify what the cumulative risks are in river deltas.""

The findings are the result of a collaboration facilitated by IU's Institute for Advanced Study with support from the Environmental Resilience Institute.

The team’s analysis shows that river deltas occupy 0.5 percent of the earth’s land surface, yet they contain 4.5 percent of the global population—a total of 339 million people. Because river deltas form at the ocean at or below sea level, they are highly prone to storm surges, which are expected to occur more frequently due to climate change-fueled sea-level rise and coastal flooding.

In the study, IU researchers analyzed these geographic regions, which include cities like New Orleans, Bangkok, and Shanghai, using a new global dataset to determine how many people live on river deltas, how many are vulnerable to a 100-year storm surge event, and the ability of the deltas to naturally mitigate impacts of climate change.

“River deltas present special challenges for predicting coastal floods that deserve more attention in discussions about the future impacts of climate change,” said IU Distinguished Professor of Anthropology Eduardo Brondizio, a co-author of the study who has been working with rural and urban communities in the Amazon delta for 3 decades. “Our estimates are likely a minimum because the storm surge and flooding models do not account for the compound interactions of the climate impacts, deficient infrastructure, and high population density.”

With Edmonds and Brondizio, co-authors on the study include Rebecca Caldwell and graduate student Sacha Siani.

In addition to the threat of flooding, many of the residents in river deltas are low-income and experience water, soil, and air pollution, poor and subnormal housing infrastructure, and limited access to public services. According to the study, of the 339 million people living on deltas throughout the world, 31 million of these people are living in the 100-year storm surge floodplains. To make matters worse, 92 percent of the 31 million live in developing or least-developed economies. As a result, some of the most disadvantaged populations are among the most at-risk to the impacts of climate change.

“These communities are already dealing with health risks, lack of sanitation and services, poverty, and exposure to flooding and other environmental risks. Climate change is exacerbating all of these issues and creating more impacts,” Brondizio said.

To conduct their study, the researchers created a global dataset of delta populations and areas, aggregating 2,174 delta locations. They then cross-referenced the dataset with a land population count to determine how many people were living in the deltas. To determine the natural mitigation capacity of the deltas, researchers looked at the volume of incoming sediment deposited by rivers and other waterways flowing out to sea. The volume of incoming sediment was compared to the relative area of the delta to determine if the delta would be considered sediment starved and thus unable to naturally mitigate flooding.

Decades of engineering have expanded the habitable land area of river deltas, but they’ve also starved the regions of flood-preventing sediment. Without the sediment being renewed naturally, the shorelines will continue to recede, worsening the impacts of storm surges

“To effectively prepare for more intense future coastal flooding, we need to reframe it as a problem that disproportionately impacts people on river deltas in developing and least-developed economies,” said Edmonds. “We need better models for the climate impacts that are capable of stimulating compound flooding in densely populated areas so that exposure and risk can be mapped to more accurately assess risk and vulnerability.”

383,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"In parched Afghanistan, drought sharpens water dispute with Iran - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-iran-water-idUSKBN1K702H,"KABUL (Reuters) - Rafiqullah Dawoodzai says his fields were too dry to sow crops this year, the first time he has skipped a growing season in more than 40 years. The 60 acres he farms lie along the banks of Afghanistan’s Helmand River, but the country lacks the infrastructure to use its waters for large-scale irrigation.

Severe drought across much of Afghanistan is spurring plans to build new dams to help farmers such as Dawoodzai. It is also aggravating tensions with Iran over supplies from the Helmand - a decades-old dispute that has fed accusations that Tehran is helping the Taliban insurgency.

“We can see the Helmand River water, we can even go touch it, but we can’t bring it’s water to our farmlands,” said Dawoodzai, who grows wheat and lentils in the southern province of Helmand. “It is frustrating for every farmer to see large amounts of Helmand River water flowing into Iran.”

Afghan officials say their country, which has one of the lowest levels of water storage capacity in the world, needs the extra dams to feed its agriculture sector, the mainstay of the $20 billion economy, which has been brutally hit by drought.

With drought prevailing across the region and protests against water shortages rocking Iran, Afghanistan’s announcement in April that it would press ahead with plans for new dams and reservoirs prompted objections from the Tehran government, which fears its supplies will be cut.

The row underscores the growing strategic importance of water across the world. Water disputes have become common in South and Central Asia and elsewhere.

Earlier this year, the Taliban threatened to overrun Afghanistan’s western province of Farah, on the border with Iran, drawing angry warnings from local politicians that Tehran was using the insurgents to fight a proxy war over water.

“Iran is supporting the Taliban to disrupt developmental projects in Afghanistan, including water dams,” said Gul Nabi Ahmadzai, the former Afghan border police chief.

“They benefit from keeping Afghanistan unstable and want to control our resources,” he said.

Iranian diplomats in Kabul declined to comment. Tehran has repeatedly denied helping the Taliban.

“The dialogue between the two governments for resolving water issues is being pursued through diplomatic channels and linking this issue with Afghanistan’s internal issues has no logical, accurate or rational basis,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said in May, after the Farah attacks, according to a report from the Iranian Students’ News Agency.

ERRATIC SUPPLIES

Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has seen a 45 per cent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture said.

“We have to protect the national interest,” said Fahimullah Ziaee, who until June served as the country’s junior minister for irrigation and natural resources, and who participated in talks with Iran earlier this year. “We cannot be dictated to by any country on how to protect our natural resources.”

Tehran had already voiced concern that the huge Indian-financed Salma Dam in western Herat province, inaugurated in 2016, would see its water supplies reduced.

Recent meetings with Afghan officials over plans for additional dams have re-ignited the issue, according to two senior Iranian officials, one based in Tehran and the second in Kabul.

Plans to improve Afghanistan’s water storage capacity have been on the drawing board for decades but now the government is actively seeking aid from international donors to build two dams and increase the height of existing dams.

At the center of the dispute is the Helmand river, which runs through much of Afghanistan from its source in the mountains north of Kabul, feeding the Sistan wetlands in the border regions of the two countries.

Water from the Helmand River is in principle shared under a 1973 treaty, which assigned Iran 820 million cubic meters of water a year. But with Afghanistan at war for the past 40 years the supply has been erratic.

“It is not like we are forcing Afghanistan to give us water,” said a senior official in Tehran working in the irrigation department. “They have to honor the water sharing agreement and seek our consent to prevent environmental damage caused by their dams.”

Donors such as India, which has expressed interest in investing on two dams in central Afghanistan, must consult Iran before supporting large dam building projects, which critics say cause severe environmental damage both down and upstream, the official said.

A senior Indian diplomat in Kabul said it planned to construct dams in Afghanistan, but would not intervene in a bilateral water dispute between Tehran and Kabul.

“Afghanistan’s government wants us to help them build dams, we will go ahead with the plans. We don’t see the need to secure Iran’s permission for such projects,” said the Indian official.

Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan declined to comment on the water dispute.

Afghan officials say a lack of dams on their side of the border has made it impossible to control the run-off into Iran, which they say has received well above its allotted share of water.

Irrigation ministry officials in Kabul said that last year Iran received more than 3 billion cubic meters, at a time when the effects of drought, which now afflicts 20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, were already starting to be felt.

However reaching agreement is made more difficult by the fact that the Dehravud gauging station on the Kajaki dam, the point agreed in the 1973 treaty for measuring the annual flow, is currently under Taliban control and no official has been able to visit since 2015.

“We want to resolve a dispute with Iran but there are some security issues, our country is under tremendous stress and Iran must understand,” said Naseer Ahmad Durrani, deputy minister for agriculture, irrigation and livestock.",2018-07-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['afghanistans', 'water', 'dams', 'tehran', 'parched', 'drought', 'iran', 'dispute', 'afghanistan', 'helmand', 'river', 'kabul', 'officials', 'sharpens']",Afghanistan,news article,English

Zimbabwe’s government said it has secured combined loans of $108 million from the Export-Import Bank of China and Export-Import Bank of India to fix its power crisis.

The state-run Herald newspaper reports that the government concluded the loan agreements in the last few months.

The loans according to government officials should significantly help to the country’s power generation projects and broadband expansion.

Areas to receive boost and upgrade according to the government are Bulawayo and Hwange.

Zimbabwe has been experiencing power crisis since May this year, with parts of the country without power for several hours daily.

South Africa has tried to assist but largely unsuccessful due to it’s own power crisis.

The reported impact of power crisis according to the business community in Zimbabwe is around $200m in lost revenue.

Declining water levels in Lake Kariba have plunged most parts of the country into darkness for longer periods per day.

Water levels continue to decline in Zimbabwe’s Lake Kariba which is a source for power generation hydro-electric dam in Kariba.

These pictures show the shocking injuries sustained by residents of a small farming community in China after a pack of wolves attacked them.

A pack of around four or five wolves surrounded the farm after being 'driven mad' by hunger following the worst drought in decades.

People living there managed to flee, but not before some had their ears bitten off, while others suffered facial injuries, as well as cuts to their hands and chests.

Residents in the Altay village, in China's Xinjiang region, said it was unheard of for wolves to approach humans, never mind launch such a savage attack close to residential buildings.

After the people on the farm had fled the wolves attacked the animals, killing several of them.

The animals have apparently been driven mad by hunger caused by the drought, where the average rainfall was down by a third affecting nearly a million hectares of crops.

Hundreds of thousands of farm animals have also been left without water and the economic damage is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.

Many of the animals that the wolves might have otherwise fed on have died from lack of food.

China has seen lone wolf attacks before, but an attack by a pack of wolves is considered extremely rare.",2014-08-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['starving', 'ears', 'drought', 'hunger', 'email', 'driven', 'animals', 'wolves', 'pack', 'injuries', 'villagers', 'mad', 'bite', 'farm']",China,news article,English
863,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Lesotho: Drought Breeds Multi-Faceted Crises for Border Communities - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160104.html,"The recent El-Nino induced drought has spawned a multi-faceted crisis for Basotho communities in the border areas with South Africa who are often forced to illegally graze their livestock in the neighbouring country.

The practice of seeking pastures in South Africa has opened up the border communities to a whole range of conflicts with their neighbours who have retaliated by either stealing or impounding the livestock and demanding hefty fines of as much as M2500 for the release of each cow.

In addition, some of the impoverished families have forced their young girls into early marriages of convenience in the neighbouring country due to the financial inducements associated with the practice which has been defined by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPA) as a human rights violation.

This came out during a recent media field trip to Mohale's Hoek which was organised by the UNFPA and the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF). The field trip was part of a media training programme on mainstreaming issues of child protection, gender based violence and migration as well as humanitarian emergencies into broader media coverage.

Lesotho is among several countries in the region that experienced poor harvest due to the El-Nino induced drought. UNFPA Communications officer Violet Maraisane said that it is estimated that at least 500 000 Basotho (a quarter of the population) are food insecure and would need assistance.

Some of the socio-economic challenges stemming from the drought include increasing crime, high rates of school dropouts, early child marriages and teenage pregnancies.

Speaking at the field trip, Mohale's Hoek Police Officer Commanding Sephapho's Border Gate, Sub Inspector Francis Pita said due to the declining pastures and the poor harvests of the 2018/19 agricultural season, livestock farmers who opted to graze their animals in neighbouring South Africa had become victims of stock theft and the impounding of their animals.

Sub Inspector Pita said Basotho nationals took advantage of the porous borders to illegally graze their livestock in South Africa. He said this had created a vicious circle where local and South African farmers stole each other's livestock.

""On this (Lesotho) side there is no veld solely because of the drought and the fact that farmers this side do not practice rotational grazing so they end up stealing or grazing their livestock in the fields of SA farmers,"" Sub Inspector Pita said.

""Some Basotho steal the livestock in South Africa and others even steal animal feed to come and feed their own livestock.""

He said such practices caused problems for local farmers whose livestock were impounded as they were forced to pay fines in the region of M2500 for the release of each cow.

""That is a lot of money and because most families do not have it, they forfeit their animals leading to even more poverty. The story does not end there as some Basotho retaliate by going back to steal from the South Africans and this sometimes leads to bloodshed and death.

""The South Africans also cross over to steal livestock. Sometime in March this year in Ha-Moeketsi, 17 cows were stolen from one family and two weeks later the victim died probably due to depression since most people rely on their livestock to feed their families.""

Sub Inspector Pita said due to the frequent droughts, ""so many children have become school dropouts who cross into South Africa and enter into marriages of convenience which backfires as they are burdened with children they cannot care for"".

UNFPA Communications officer Violet Maraisane subsequently told the Lesotho Times that this was much more than just a farmers' conflict as it also created more humanitarian challenges.

Ms Maraisane said they had conducted a drought assessment which showed that at least 500 000 Basotho were food insecure and would need assistance.

""It is on the basis of this that the UN in Lesotho undertook early action to deliver urgent lifesaving multi-sectoral emergency assistance to severely food insecure households and to address the impacts of drought and erratic rainfall affecting the population in Mohale's Hoek, Maseru, Mafeteng, Quthing and Qacha's Nek districts.

""UN agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), UNICEF, UNFPA, World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) jointly with national partners, mobilised funds from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to address priority humanitarian needs in nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, agriculture, food security and health,"" Ms Maraisane said

She said the UN is providing lifesaving multi-sectoral emergency assistance to communities through the CERF-funded project titled, ""Provision of life saving protection, gender based violence and psychosocial support to drought affected populations"".

""IOM and UNICEF focus on informing the community on protection risks around migration and child protection.

""Child marriages are a human rights violation. Despite laws against it, the practice remains widespread. Globally, one in every five girls is married before reaching the age of 18.

""Child marriages threatens girls' lives and health and it limits their future prospects. Girls pressed into child marriages often become pregnant while still adolescents, increasing the risk of complications in pregnancy or childbirth. These complications are the leading cause of death among older adolescent girls,"" Ms Maraisane said.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security's Director General for Veterinary Services, Relebohile Mahloane, said although the government worked hard to assist Basotho it was not possible to come to the aid of those who engaged in illegal activities like grazing their livestock in neighbouring South Africa.

Dr Mahloane said local farmers had dismally failed to preserve their own grazing ranges through their failure to implement sustainable grazing practices and this had caused them to be vulnerable to their South African counterparts who impounded their livestock.

""What they (local farmers) are doing (grazing their livestock in South Africa) is illegal and SA farmers leave them to do such acts so they can take advantage of them,"" Dr Mahloane said.",2019-07-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['drought', 'africa', 'marriages', 'food', 'livestock', 'farmers', 'breeds', 'lesotho', 'multifaceted', 'grazing', 'basotho', 'border', 'south', 'maraisane', 'communities', 'crises']",Ghana,news article,English
442,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Is Water Scarcity a Bigger Threat Than the Taliban in Afghanistan? - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2018/10/is-water-scarcity-a-bigger-threat-than-the-taliban-in-afghanistan/,"Advertisement

The United Nations has stated that water scarcity — not war — is a rising cause for displacement in Afghanistan. There are 1.5 million Afghans, approximately 4 percent of the population, that are displaced and 448,000 were added in 2017 alone. The U.S. Geological Survey has stated that the groundwater level has, on average, declined by 1.4 mm between 2004-2012, and 22 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces are facing drought today. According to the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), only 27 percent of the Afghan population has access to safe drinking water and 37 percent use sanitation facilities.

Water Scarcity or Crisis?

There are very real ground realities indicating water scarcity; however, in aggregate terms, Afghanistan has an adequate amount of water. There are approximately five major river basins in the state — Amu Darya, Harirud-Murghab, Helmand, Kabul, and Northern — and altogether these are estimated to provide 75 billion cubic meters (BCM) of accessible water. According to Cooperation for Peace and Unity, this averages out to 3,063.1 cubic meters per capita. Furthermore, the Afghanistan National Development Strategy has listed the present usage as 19.08 BCM — which is merely 33 percent of total surface water.

Access to water is not the same as availability of water. The only basin in which 100 percent of water is presently being used is the Northern basin; all others are using less than 60 percent of total available water. Among the drought affected provinces, Bamyan, Daykundi, Ghor, Helmand, Kandahar, Jawzjan, Nangarhar, Nimroz, Nuristan, Takhar, Badghis and Uruzgan have been reported as critical priority for nutrition and water sanitation, and hygiene assistance. The issue of water scarcity is not evenly felt across the state, as geographical constraints provide different realities for people in different areas. The water crisis is further complicated due to seasonal time scale and spatial distribution of water sources. Therefore, Afghanistan is not necessarily naturally water stressed — it is facing a water crisis that has been exacerbated by the mismanagement of its available water supply.

Mismanagement, Climate Change and Geopolitics

The United Nations in 2006 stated that the water crisis is not due to a physical absence of freshwater, rather the mismanagement and lack of investment in water supplies. Three decades of war destroyed much of the water management system that existed in the country. However, with the assistance of the international community, Afghanistan has been rebuilding these systems. The international community providing assistance has primarily focused on rehabilitating and rejuvenating old water networks and systems that were destroyed. However, the World Bank cited that the investment and programs for the Agricultural and Water sector has had modest impact on the “rural economy and improving rural livelihoods.”

The Ministry of Water and Energy reports that 90 percent of total water consumption in the country is for agricultural purposes, which sees more than 50 percent water loss due to inefficient systems of water management — mainly unsustainable irrigation for crop production. There are formal and informal irrigation systems in Afghanistan. The formal systems are large-scale irrigation schemes developed with the assistance of the central government in financing, management, operations, and maintenance. However, 88 percent of the total irrigated area is still done through informal systems of irrigation, which are centuries old and traditionally developed to address water management locally. In informal systems, water management is monitored and administered by traditional water masters called Mirabs. Farmers meet with the local Mirab for a number of different purposes, including discussing irrigation plans as well as resolving disputes — in some cases the Mirabs physically open and close the channels for irrigation.

The Ministry of Water and Energy blames most of Afghanistan’s water crisis on its “vulnerability” to climate change, citing a 62 percent drop in rainwater. Higher average temperatures are also increasing the amount of snowmelt from the mountains earlier in the year. A lack of infrastructure will result in this snowmelt being lost as runoff rather than being stored in reservoirs. With 8 million Afghans currently facing food insecurity, this number will drastically increase with the drought aggregating the food deficit in 2018. Afghanistan is also considered one of the world’s most prone areas to desertification, which is the rising cause of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, soil erosion and landslides.

Furthermore, water is not a national resource — it is a transboundary resource that extends beyond political borders. Afghanistan is not the only state in the region facing shortages of water. Iran, Pakistan, and other neighboring states are also facing water shortages. Therefore, as Afghanistan begins to invest in the management of its water supply by constructing dams, irrigation systems, diversions and other infrastructure at a larger scale, it will alter hydrological relations with neighboring states. Currently, Afghanistan only has one agreement with Iran that was signed in 1973, which outlines the allocation of discharge from Helmand river to Iran year round.

The United States 2011 Water Scarcity report stated that “the U.S. approach could exacerbate regional tensions” if the interconnectivity of water issues between Central and South Asian states is neglected. Thus, the management of water requires a national policy that ensures the most efficient usage and sustainable extraction of water, within a larger international framework that has been negotiated with neighbouring states. It is absolutely essential for the Afghan government to engage in bilateral and multilateral negotiations, through a process known as hydrodiplomacy, which it has been largely absent from. Without this vital process, infrastructure development will be faced with strict obstruction.

1568,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Kabbalah of Information: 'The Theory of Evil - Part I' - The Jerusalem Post,https://www.jpost.com/kabbalah/kabbalah-of-information-evil-does-not-abide-with-you-psalms-55-658259,"Introduction

The following will introduce the fundamental principles of the Kabbalah of Information regarding the structure and functioning of Creation, based on an analysis of events described in the Torah and the Nevi’im (Prophets). There will be a particular focus on the concept of Evil in Creation.



When studying the Torah, it is important to approach the text as a single whole: each letter, each word, and each story is interconnected.



In addition to the 613 commandments that are explicitly listed, the Torah also contains a wealth of other teachings and lessons. In order to uncover these lessons, one must reveal the hidden links, parallels, and patterns that exist between the events described in the Torah.



This task requires knowledge of the Kabbalah.



Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, a 2nd-century Tannaitic sage and disciple of Rabbi Akiva, described the stories in the Torah as the garments, the commandments as the body, and the Kabbalah as the soul of the Torah.



This article will attempt to analyze the following interconnected stories through the lens of the Kabbalah of Information:



> The Flood

> Abraham’s descent into and ascent from Egypt

> The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the salvation of Lot

> Jacob’s flight from Laban with his family

> The Exodus



The links between these stories will be traced according to the following considerations:

1 - All of the individuals mentioned in the stories above suffered from a higher evil that they could not overcome on their own.

According to the Kabbalah, the higher the root of the animal soul, the lower it may fall. It is believed that the souls of the most malevolent villains are initially formed at a higher level of revelation of the information conveyed by HaShem (the Almighty). In other words, they are very powerful. This is true of the antediluvians, the Pharaoh of the time of Abraham, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Laban, the Pharaoh of the Exodus period, and Esau. This seemingly paradoxical fact requires further clarification, which will be provided in the following sections.

2 - All of the stories mentioned above involve the direct intervention of HaShem with miraculous deliverance.

3 - None of the individuals in any of the stories listed above broke from evil entirely:





— Noah took a grapevine with him on the Ark.

— Hagar accompanied Abraham and Sarah out of Egypt.

— Lot’s wife looked back while leaving Sodom.

— Rachel stole Laban’s teraphim as Jacob fled with his family.

— When Moses delivered the children of Israel from Egypt, they were joined by ‘a great mixed multitude’ of Egyptians.



4 - All of the aforementioned events had incredibly negative and irreversible consequences.





Each story will be reviewed below in further detail, followed by a general overview from the standpoint of the Kabbalah of Information.

1 - Chapter 1:

And There Was a Severe Famine in the Land, and Abraham Descended to Egypt; or the Pharaoh’s Revenge.



A brief description of the events in this story:



The Torah tells us, “And there was a famine in the land, and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there because the famine was severe in the land.” The Torah tells us, “And there was a famine in the land, and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there because the famine was severe in the land.”

As they approach Egypt, Abram (Abraham) asks his wife Sarai (Sarah) to pretend to be his sister. Pharaoh takes Sarah to the palace and bestows on Abraham herds of animals, menservants, and maidservants.

cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); }); if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""656089"") != -1){console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none"";} HaShem then sends plagues onto Pharaoh and his household on account of Sarah. The Midrash B’reishit Rabbah gives the following description of the event: “Rabbi Levi said: All that night the angel stood with a staff in his hand and hit. If she said ‘Hit,’ he hit; if she said ‘Leave,’ he left.”

Pharaoh realizes that he has been deceived, returns Sarah to Abraham, and gives him money. Abraham and Sarah return to the Holy Land.

After some time, we learn that they are accompanied by Hagar, an Egyptian woman who had become Sarah’s handmaid.

This story has elicited much commentary, but the sages remain divided in opinion.

For example, Rashi wrote in his commentary that the famine was meant to challenge Abraham’s faith: “To test him, whether he would think ill of the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who ordered him to go to the Land of Canaan, and now He was forcing him to leave it.”

Therefore, Abraham is commended for not questioning the will of HaShem and descending into Egypt.

This interpretation is shared by Abraham ibn Ezra.

Ramban, however, held the polar opposite opinion.

In his commentary on the Torah, he writes, “And know that [our patriarch] Abraham sinned a great sin inadvertently, by bringing his wife the saint in a compromising situation, due to his fear that he be killed.” He further suggests that Abraham should have trusted HaShem to save both him, his wife, and all that they owned, as HaShem had the power to aid and to protect him. Ramban insists that Abraham’s descent from the land where he had been guided was a sin as he should have known that HaShem would have kept him from perishing during the famine. “Because of this action,” he concludes, “It was decreed that his descendants be exiled to Egypt at the hand of Pharaoh.”

The belief that Abraham’s descent into Egypt would lead to the exile is also expressed in the Zohar.

It is later revealed that Hagar also left Egypt with Sarah and Abraham. It is important to note that the Torah provides information about Hagar immediately after describing the prophecy of the exile to Egypt.

Who was Hagar, and how did she become part of Sarah and Abraham’s household? The Torah does not say. However, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the Midrash B’reishit Rabbah explains that: “Hagar was Pharaoh’s daughter. When he saw the deeds on behalf of Sarah in his house, he took his daughter and gave her to her, saying, ‘Better that my daughter be a maidservant in this house than a mistress in another house.’”

This author believes that by analyzing the consequences of Hagar joining Abraham and Sarah’s household, another explanation for the event may be provided.

Pharaoh ruled the most powerful empire on earth. A small tribe enters his land, headed by a ‘shepherd.’ The shepherd has a very beautiful sister. Pharaoh takes the sister to his palace and bestows immense riches on her brother. From Pharaoh’s point of view, there is nothing unlawful about his actions.

However, it becomes apparent that the ‘shepherd’ has tricked him by disguising his wife as his sister. This event is followed by the punishment described above and the departure of Abraham’s family from Egypt, taking great riches.

What might Pharaoh have felt in this situation?





Firstly, he might have felt extreme humiliation (undeserved, from his point of view). It is worth noting that this punishment would have felt particularly shameful, as it was caused by a woman. This is reaffirmed, for instance, in Judges: “And Abimelech came up to the tower, and fought against it. And he went close to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. And a certain woman cast a piece of an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. And he called hastily to the young man, his weapon bearer, and said to him, ‘Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ And his young man pierced him, and he died.”

At the same time, Pharaoh must have also been overcome with fear and hatred. Fear because he could feel that the Higher Power was on Abraham’s side. Hatred because of how deeply he had been humiliated. It would be reasonable to assume that Pharaoh wanted to seek revenge, but he could not afford to do so openly out of fear of the Higher Power. Thus, he decided to give away his daughter Hagar to serve as a handmaid. In this author’s opinion, Pharaoh understood that Hagar, a princess who owned countless slaves herself, would never be content as a simple handmaid in the household of Abraham and that sooner or later, this discontent would become manifest. Therefore, Pharaoh set the scene for potential conflict within Abraham’s household, and the events that followed would confirm the success of his plan.



The success of Pharaoh’s plan can be evidenced by the following arguments:

1 - The Torah provides information that Hagar left Egypt with Sarah and Abraham directly after disclosing information about the exile to Egypt.

2 - It is safe to assume that Sarah had several maidservants, including some from Ur Kaśdim (Ur of the Chaldeans), where her family lived. However, the servant that she gave away to become Abraham’s wife was Hagar the Egyptian. This fact also raises questions, as we know from the Torah that the men from Abraham’s family traditionally married their relatives (see Isaac or Jacob).

3 - Hagar becomes pregnant, which instantly elevates her over Sarah. Sarah loses importance in Hagar’s eyes. In the Midrash Bereishit Rabbah, we read: “Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeyahu in the name of Rabbi Hiya bar Abba said:...Hagar would tell them: ‘My mistress Sarai is not inside what she is outside: she appears to be righteous, but she is not righteous, had she been a righteous woman, see how many years have passed without her conceiving, whereas I conceived in one night!’”

4 - The fact that Sarah offered Hagar as Abraham’s second wife indicates that she (Sarah) had absolute confidence in Hagar’s loyalty to her, which, in turn, must mean that Hagar reaffirmed her devotion and love towards Sarah. However, as soon as Hagar conceives Abraham’s child, her behavior changes dramatically, and she starts to despise Sarah, essentially betraying her (this is Pharaoh’s plan in action).



5 - Sarah accuses Abraham of being too passive and invokes the Judgment of HaShem (Havaya) between them.



The Midrash quotes Rabbi Tanhuma as saying in the name of Rabbi Hiyya the Great and Rabbi Berehiah, who in turn spoke in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, that “He who invokes judgment shall not escape judgment either. Sarah was intended to live as long as Abraham, but because she told Abraham, ‘May the Lord judge between me and you!’, forty-eight years were cut from her lifespan.” The Midrash quotes Rabbi Tanhuma as saying in the name of Rabbi Hiyya the Great and Rabbi Berehiah, who in turn spoke in the name of Rabbi Eleazar, that “He who invokes judgment shall not escape judgment either. Sarah was intended to live as long as Abraham, but because she told Abraham, ‘May the Lord judge between me and you!’, forty-eight years were cut from her lifespan.”

6 - Considering that calling upon HaShem’s Judgement is a very extreme measure, one may assume that Abraham and Sarah had a major argument and completely failed to understand each other, which pushed Sarah to seek HaShem’s aid.

Preliminary Conclusions



Hagar, an Egyptian maidservant, creates a rupture in Abraham and Sarah’s family, which results in Sarah’s lifespan being shortened by forty-eight years. It should be noted that HaShem considers interpersonal relationships more important than our relationship with Him. There are two facts in the Torah that prompt this conclusion:



1 - Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because they violated the laws of hospitality. 1 - Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because they violated the laws of hospitality.

2 - The builders of the Tower of Babel were not destroyed, even though they intended to wage war on HaShem Himself. Instead, they were merely scattered across the earth because they had been a close-knit group and had treated each other with respect.

When people are arguing and divided, they are spiritually incapable of properly serving HaShem. Therefore, the conflict over Hagar diminished the spiritual level of Abraham and Sarah’s service. This will be discussed in further detail later in the article.

However, this is not the full extent of the negative consequences suffered by Abraham’s household due to the descent to Egypt and Hagar’s presence.

Abraham gives Hagar back to Sarah, who starts mistreating her. Hagar flees from Abraham’s home. This escape was an extraordinary feat on Hagar’s part, as runaway slaves were punished by death at the time.

This bold escape indicates Hagar’s strength of character; she was a princess through and through. Upon reaching a well in the desert, Hagar encounters an angel sent by HaShem (Havaya). The angel orders her to return to Sarah and informs her that she will have a son, whom she should name Ishmael.

Hagar addresses HaShem (Havaya) by saying, “You are the God of seeing (El Roi)!”, then names the well Lachai Ro’i. E-l is the name of HaShem that corresponds to the merciful aspect of Creation. Hagar returns to Abraham’s household and gives birth to her son, Ishmael.

In so doing, HaShem answers Abraham’s plea for an heir. However, because of Abraham’s descent to Egypt, it is Hagar, the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh, not Abraham’s first wife Sarah, who becomes the mother of his firstborn child. Abraham and Pharaoh are now kin, and the Pharaoh’s bloodline will continue through Ishmael. The sages note that Ishmael’s descendants have been among the worst enemies of the Jewish people.

‘HAGAR GIVING Ishmael Water From the Miraculous Well in the Desert,’ Charles Paul Landon. After some time, Sarah urges Abraham to cast out Hagar and Ishmael, saying, “The son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son.”

A later passage in the Torah states, “But the matter greatly displeased Abraham, concerning his son.” It is not hard to imagine the extent of Abraham’s distress. After all, he was to banish his firstborn son. However, HaShem appears to him under the name El-im, which stands for judgment. This is especially important. HaShem commands Abraham to do as Sarah tells him and promises that He will protect Ishmael.

The appearance of HaShem to Abraham under the name El-im signifies that every action performed by those in this story will be subject to judgment and bear the consequences.

Abraham banishes Hagar and Ishmael, leaving them all but empty-handed. They receive no more than a piece of bread and a waterskin, in effect sentencing them to near-certain death in the desert. This decision on the part of Abraham requires an in-depth analysis. In the Kabbalah, Abraham embodies the attribute of Chesed (loving kindness, charity) at the absolute level. He was known to welcome total strangers into his home, offer them food and drink, and encourage them to embrace HaShem. In light of the above, it is quite clear that sending Hagar and Ishmael into the desert is a direct contradiction of Chesed.

Commenting on this event, Rashi explains that Abraham did not give Ishmael any gold or silver because he hated him for his wicked deeds. However, this statement directly contradicts another one of Rashi’s comments, where he elaborates on the command HaShem gave to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

The Torah says, “And He said, ‘Please take your son, your only one, whom you love, yea, Isaac, and go away to the land of Moriah...’”

Rashi interprets this passage as follows: He [Abraham] said to Him, “I have two sons.” He [God] said to him, “Your only one.” He said to Him, “This one is the only son of his mother, and that one is the only son of his mother.” He said to him, “Whom you love.” He said to Him, “I love them both.” He said to him, “Isaac.”’

It seems that these two comments by Rashi seem to contract each other. The first speaks of hate, the second of love.

There is another explanation behind Abraham’s uncharacteristic behavior. To understand, one must look at the words said by Sarah to Abraham: “Drive out this handmaid and her son, for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son.”

From these words, it can be concluded that Sarah is not just telling Abraham to exile Hagar and Ishmael; she is also forbidding him from giving them any property. This is why HaShem will later appear to Abraham as El-im (judgment). Sarah may have been motivated by the fact that Abraham owed all of his wealth to the suffering that she endured in the house of Pharaoh and the house of Abimelech.

From the above events, we can conclude that Sarah never forgave Hagar for her betrayal. She had to put up with her presence, because she had been unable to bear a child. With the birth of Isaac, the situation had changed.

Sarah knew that Isaac and Ishmael could not live together because there would be continued strife and rivalry between them. From that point of view, the decision to banish Hagar and Ishmael was correct. However, to send them empty-handed into the desert, especially that given that Ishmael was ill, was unnecessary cruelty.

Thus, we witness yet another negative consequence of Abraham’s descent to Egypt: he is forced to banish his firstborn child into the desert empty-handed. This causes Abraham immense pain.

After some time, HaShem commands Abraham to take Isaac up the mountain and bind him as a sacrificial offering. This raises the question: was this command linked to any of the previous events? Rashi cites the sages who believed that this could have been due to Satan’s complaint to HaShem that Abraham was not making the customary offerings. Another theory stipulates that this event was instigated by Isaac boasting to Ishmael that he was ready to sacrifice himself to HaShem. The very fact that the sages were trying to determine the reason behind the binding of Isaac affirms that they could not (or would not) conceive that this extremely painful challenge could not be the result of some past misdoing.

This urges the consideration of another version of the above-mentioned events based on the ‘measure for measure’ principle. Sarah tells Abraham to cast Ishmael, the son of Hagar, into the desert, while he, according to the sages, was sick and bereft of any source of sustenance, effectively dooming him to perish. HaShem, under the name El-im (judgment), assuages Abraham’s anguish, telling him that He will take care of Ishmael. HaShem then performs a miracle to save Ishmael.

According to the ‘measure for measure’ principle, HaShem instructs Abraham to take Isaac, the son of Sarah, to the mountain and bind him as a sacrificial offering. However, Abraham had earlier been given the prophecy that Isaac would become his heir. Abraham passes the test, proving himself worthy. HaShem miraculously saves Isaac, yet we can imagine how Sarah felt when she learned of HaShem’s command. The story of the binding of Isaac (Aqeidah) contains multiple explicit and implicit lessons that will be examined further on.

The following is one of several arguments (which will be provided below) in favor of the opinion that the Aqeidah was linked to Ishmael’s exile:

1. Hagar flees Abraham’s household and meets an angel of Havaya. The angel tells her that she will give birth to a son and that she must name this son Ishmael, then commands her to return. Hagar names the well Lachai Ro’i.

2. The passage that describes the meeting between Isaac and Rebecca specifies that Isaac “was on his way, coming from Be’er Lachai Ro’i.” In his commentary, Rashi suggests that Isaac must have traveled to the well “to bring Hagar [who had been given the new name, Keturah] to Abraham, his father, that he should marry her” following Sarah’s death.

The story of Abraham’s funeral mentions that Isaac returns to Lachai Ro’i after burying his father. Rashi does not provide any commentary on this event.

Based on the aforementioned points, it can be concluded that Isaac did not merely travel to Lachai Ro’i in order to fetch Hagar. Rather, he lived there. In this case, the question is: what is the connection between Isaac’s residence near Lachai Ro’i and the Aqeidah? This author believes that there is, in fact, a direct connection.

In the Torah, Isaac asks Abraham, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” To which Abraham replies, “G-d [referred to as El-im, judgment] will provide for Himself [yir’eh-lo] the lamb for the burnt offering.” When Abraham raises his knife over Isaac, he is stopped by an angel of Havaya (in this instance, the name Havaya appears as the emanation of mercy).

A further passage reads, “And Abraham named that place, The Lord [Havaya] will see, as it is said to this day: On the mountain, the Lord will be seen.” This signifies that the Temple will be built in that spot, and Havaya will see the offerings made here by the Jewish people. The location will, therefore, become a place where the information conveyed by Havaya will be made particularly clear.

The Lech-Lecha reading that describes Hagar’s flight states: “And an angel of the Lord [Havaya] found her by a water fountain in the desert [...] and she [Hagar] called the name of the Lord [Havaya], Who had spoken to her, ‘You are the G-d [E-l] of seeing’ [...] Therefore the well was called Be’er Lachai Ro’i [The Well of Seeing].”

The name HAVAYA symbolizes the entire Sefirot system and may represent both mercy and judgment, whereas E-l represents a specific Sefirah: the attribute of Chesed (loving kindness, sharing). Therefore, we see that an angel of Havaya appears to both Abraham on the Mountain and to Hagar, near the well. References to both of these locations given by Abraham and Hagar are almost identical, but in the second story, the name E-l is added.

This prompts the conclusion that the Lachai Ro’i well must have been a powerful place of revelation, where a significant amount of information from HAVAYA was disclosed (albeit not as powerful as the location of the future Temple).

In his commentary on the seventh reading of the Vayeira, the Lubavitcher Rebbe notes that Isaac gained the sacred status of a burned offering: the kind of sanctity that no other man had ever achieved before.

This leads to the conclusion that Isaac must have been highly receptive to the information conveyed by HAVAYA. Furthermore, this is likely why he settled near the Lachai Ro’i well.

In light of the above, it may be concluded that the binding of Isaac is linked directly to the events involving Hagar and Ishmael.

From the above, we can see that taking Hagar from Egypt caused a chain of painful events which affected Abraham, Sarah, and all the Jewish people.

Noah

Noah was part of the sinful pre-flood generation and could not have changed his circumstances on his own. Thanks to the miraculous intervention of HaShem, Noah and his family were spared from the Flood.

HaShem gave Noah clear instructions regarding what and whom he was allowed to take aboard the Ark. However, the Torah later mentions that Noah also took a grapevine. HaShem had not commanded him to do this, but neither had He explicitly prohibited it.

Either way, the presence of this very grapevine would be one of the factors that would provoke the devastating events revealed later in the Torah.

There are several interpretations of the nature of the forbidden fruit eaten by Adam and Eve. According to one interpretation, the forbidden fruit was a grape. There is significant reason to believe that this was the case.

Therefore, grapes indirectly caused the original sin and helped evil infiltrate the world. The grapevine prompted the downfall of Noah, who might have otherwise become the new Adam. Another argument in support of this theory could be the fact that the Nazirites were prohibited from consuming any food or drink involving grapes.

As such, a ‘pattern of Abraham’ is clearly evident. Like Abraham, Noah is miraculously freed from evil but does not sever his ties to evil entirely. The consequences for this are well-known.

The question naturally arises as to why Noah took a grapevine, even though HaShem had not instructed him to do so. Moreover, why was it a grapevine specifically, rather than another kind of fruit or seed?

The answer is obvious. Noah took something that he was fond of and feared losing in the Flood.

This conclusion is confirmed by subsequent events.





Lot’s Wife

In this story, Lot and his family cannot free themselves from the power of the people of Sodom, who are great sinners. Once again, HaShem intervenes miraculously. He saves Lot and his family but forbids them from looking back. Lot’s wife disobeys HaShem’s command. She looks back and is transformed into a pillar of salt.

This is yet another example of the ‘pattern of Abraham’ — the ties to evil have not been severed entirely.

It must be noted that the act of transforming a living human being into an inanimate object does not occur anywhere else in the Torah. This requires an explanation, which will be provided in a later chapter.

Jacob and Laban

In the story of Jacob and Laban, Jacob is forced to serve Laban, a sinful practitioner of magic, for twenty-one years. He decides to flee, but Laban pursues him. HaShem intervenes on behalf of Jacob and his family. He comes to Laban in a dream and tells him, “Beware lest you speak with Jacob, either good or evil.” This miraculous salvation is confirmed by Laban himself, who tells Jacob that he could have inflicted great harm upon him, but refrained from doing so, as commanded by HaShem. One would think that this means Jacob severed his ties with evil. However, this would be incorrect. Rachel stole Laban’s teraphim, which he used for black magic (meaning that they still bore a spiritual connection to him). There are numerous explanations as to why Rachel stole the idols, but we shall not dwell on them here. What matters is the sheer fact that another person’s property was stolen. The Torah tells us that HaShem, through Moses, instructed the children of Israel to destroy their idols, just as He Himself had destroyed the idols of the Egyptian gods. However, He never gave any command to steal idols, much less hold on to them.

Rachel did not tell Jacob that she had stolen the idols, knowing that he would never approve.

The story later takes a tragic turn: Laban accuses Jacob of theft. Outraged, Jacob wishes death upon the thief, not knowing that the true thief was, in fact, Rachel. She dies shortly afterward.

The “pattern of Abraham” emerges again, as the ties to evil were never truly severed.





The Exodus

As the children of Israel were fleeing Egypt, “a great mixed multitude” of Egyptians accompanied them. HaShem had commanded Moses to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt but had neither instructed nor prohibited that he take in anyone else who might join. That was Moses’ own decision. The consequences of his decision proved catastrophic for both the children of Israel and the entire world.

Marc Chagall’s ‘Moses Beholds All the Work,’ from The Story of Exodus (1966) When the Torah was first received, Moses, the Jewish people, and the rest of the world were elevated to the highest spiritual level. However, the Egyptians that left the land with the children of Israel later initiate the sinful cult of the golden calf. Along with the Jewish people, they create an idol out of gold and pray to it.

HaShem prepares to destroy the Jewish people until Moses prays for forgiveness, and HaShem chooses to reverse His decision. He does not reverse it entirely, however. Instead, He informs Moses that, rather than being personally present, He would be represented by an angel, signifying a significant spiritual downfall for the Jewish people. Moses continues to plead with HaShem not to send an angel but to remain with the Jewish people Himself. Moses knows that angels cannot think for themselves. They are, in a way, information-sharing programs. Furthermore, Moses also knows that the Jewish people would surely continue to commit sins in the future, and an angel, being an informational program, would dispense divine judgment, but have no capacity to forgive them. Only HaShem can grant forgiveness. This is reaffirmed in the works of the great Kabbalist scholars: Gates of Light by Joseph Gikatilla and The Palm Tree of Deborah by Moses Cordovero.

HaShem concedes to Moses’ pleas but reminds him that the Jewish people have not been fully absolved of their sin and that punishment is yet to follow.

The ties to evil have not been severed, and we see the “pattern of Abraham” once again.

Conclusion

The parallels identified above between events that affected different people at different times reaffirm that these stories contain an important lesson, which, in turn, requires a detailed examination through the lens of the Kabbalah of Information. This examination will be attempted in the following chapters. To achieve this, themes must be addressed in relation to the creation of information, the information space, the role of different informational worlds in Creation, the concept of the soul and its roots, the concept of evil.



I will also attempt to explain the idea of the concealment of God in the informational space. I will attempt to answer the question why the roots of the souls of the great evildoers come from a very high level. I will analyze the dynamics of the character of the Patriarchs with an emphasis on their interaction with evil and evildoers. The commandment of the Red Heifer also will be discussed.

Furthermore, subsequent chapters will provide an explanation for one highly important fact: the similarity between the command not to look back on Sodom, given by the Lord to Lot and his family, and the command not to leave the house until the morning after the Passover sacrifice, given by Moses to the Jewish people.

""In the absence of the payment vouchers, we were unable to authenticate the disbursements. We therefore request management to ensure that the schedule officers refund the amount of GH¢347,014 failure of which they would be surcharged.

According to the 2018 report by the AG, it said Regulation 39 of Financial Administration Regulations, 2004 requires that the head of accounts section of a department shall control the disbursements of funds and ensure that transactions are properly authenticated to show that amounts are due and payable and reject any disbursements that do not meet the requirement.

We observed during our review that the above provision was not fully complied with by the Hospital.

Still with the Kokrle Bu Teaching Hospital, the Auditor General has ordered the management to recover the total amount of GH¢54,157 from Mr James Clifford Oblitey, a staff of the Hospital who was given the amount through a sponsorship package as school fees payment to enable him to pursue a course in BIFM Level 2 Diploma in Facility Management at the College of Central London, United Kingdom (UK) from 2 January 2018 to March 2018.

In the report, the AG said: ""We noted that though Mr Oblitey was not successful in securing the UK entry visa, he failed to return the fees granted him by the hospital's management for the course.

""Though it could be argued that the money was paid to the school, we are of the view that under such circumstance refunds are made to applicants net of administrative charges"", the 2018 report added.

In view of this, the report recommended that the CEO should ensure the recovery of the total amount of GH¢54,157 from Mr James Clifford Oblitey less any administrative charges that must have accrued to the school.",2019-08-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['oblitey', 'officers', 'ensure', 'management', 'ag', 'korlebu', 'disbursements', 'orders', 'hospital', 'school', 'auditorgeneral', 'ghana', 'mr', 'recover', 'gh347014', 'account', 'report', 'missing', 'payment']",Ghana,news article,English
