The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and humanitarian partners have so far identified 35,549 families (223,100 individuals) displaced in the western provinces of Herat, Badghis and Ghor between January and October 2018.

Of these, 44 per cent or close to 100,000 individuals are children below the age of 18, and 19 per cent are below the age of five. More than half of the displaced have settled in Herat city, 39 per cent are in and around Qala-e-Naw, the provincial capital of Badghis, and the remaining two per cent in other provinces.

The displaced population is desperately poor and lack access to food, water, shelter and health services. Many are living in tents or in the open air with the onset of freezing winter temperatures.

USAID’s Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is responding to the crisis with a major airlift of aid, including plastic sheeting, blankets and kitchen sets, to help 10,000 families or 70,000 individuals. IOM is organizing warehousing of the aid and its distribution in Herat and Badghis over the next three weeks.

The first of three C-17 aircraft carrying the aid landed in Herat on Saturday (17/11). Two more aircraft are scheduled to arrive in the coming days.

Ambassador John Bass, speaking at Herat airport, welcomed the airlift. “The United States confirms its continuous support to the Afghan people, and we thank IOM for cooperating with USAID/OFDA in helping thousands of displaced Afghan families,” he said.

Deputy Governor of Badghis Malikzada also welcomed the aid but said that more would need to be done to alleviate suffering caused by the drought. “Assistance also needs to be provided in places of origin through investment in the agricultural sector, so that people can sustain themselves in their places of origin. We do not want to establish camps in urban centres and create subsidized communities that permanently rely on aid for survival,” he said.

So far, 8,341 families have received non-food relief items, including blankets and household items, and 5,031 have received emergency shelter. The assistance was distributed by IOM, UNHCR, IFRC, DRC, IRC and NRC. UNICEF has committed to cover the needs of an additional 3,000 families.

3.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 20 of the most drought-affected provinces in Afghanistan, UN World Food Programme reported last week.

892,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Veteran ink artist's mountain of work on display|Life|chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-09/08/content_13645698.htm,"Veteran ink artist's mountain of work on display Updated: 2011-09-08 07:57 By Zhu Linyong (China Daily)

Mountains are clearly close to ink artist Ma Jizhong's heart.

The native of Shaanxi province, which is home to the Qinling Range, says, ""I spent my youthful years in mountainous areas, and mountains have become the fountain of my artistic inspiration Actually, mountains are the refuge of my soul.""

He was speaking at the opening of his exhibition that runs through Sept 12 at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing.

Ma's five-decade oeuvre includes caricature, New Year pictures, ink figure paintings, and picture-story illustrations.

But he is best known for miti shanshui (dense landscapes), a less popular genre of Chinese ink landscape paintings, that emerged in the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) and reached its height in the Yuan Dynasty, thanks to master painter Wang Meng (1301-1385).

""The creation of a piece of miti shanshui is not only time-consuming but also technically demanding,"" explains Xue Yongnian, art critic with the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

A typical miti shanshui work often, if not always, is a well-proportioned composition on a huge rice paper scroll. Deftness in Chinese calligraphy is a prerequisite for a miti shanshui painter as the lines, dots and patches of the landscapes are all rendered in calligraphy style. Any completed miti shanshui piece must be done with great care to detail and the overall look should be such that whether viewed from afar or up-close, the painting retains its vivid look, Xue says.

This explains why very few modern painters go down this path, Xue says, pointing out that Huang Qiuyuan (1914-1979), Zhang Ding (1917-2010) and Yang Shanshen (1913-2004) were among the few courageous ones who did.

""My decades-long experience of living and working in the mountains of my home province has convinced me that this genre best suits the natural beauty of the mountains of northern China,"" explains the 70-year-old.

Born into a Catholic family in Feicheng, Shandong province, in 1941, Ma had a tumultuous childhood, defined by wars, natural disasters and abrupt family changes.

""My mother married three times just to keep her five kids alive amid a time of chaos,"" recalls Ma, who moved to Xi'an in the late 1940s where his early interest in painting was encouraged by his primary and middle school teachers.

Ma was first trained in basic Western painting techniques at Xi'an Fine Art Academy from 1958 to 1962. In 1969, he moved to the mountainous areas of Taibai county and worked for the next two decades in a culture center where he trained himself in ink art.

In late 1988, Ma moved back to Xi'an where his unique painting style attracted critical attention.

Although Ma lives in the city, he continues to be drawn to the mountains.

""I feel an invisible bond with the mountains the lush trees, the chirping birds, the gurgling springs, and the simple but healthy life of the local residents, all gladden my heart.

""I will paint the mountains all my life.""

602,Drought Sri Lanka,Contingency fund limit increased to fight drought - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/contingency-fund-limit-increased-to-fight-drought/article26252875.ece,"State raises ceiling by ₹2,000 crore as Central aid delayed

With Centre’s financial aid for drought mitigation to take more time, the Cabinet on Tuesday increased the limit of the State contingency fund from ₹150 crore by an additional ₹2,000 crore.

The decision would ensure that the money can now be released immediately to farmers without waiting for approval or preparing the proposal for its disbursement.

Additional 4,000 crore

Two weeks ago, the State government had announced that it would release ₹2,900 crore from its treasury to extend immediate assistance to farmers. With the Union government announcing a ₹4,714 crore financial package for Maharashtra, the State later announced that it will pay an additional ₹4,000 crore from its treasury, which will later be reimbursed after arrival of Centre’s aid.

Initially, the contingency fund limit was ₹50 crore, which was increased to ₹150 crore and now stands at ₹2,150 crore.

The money from this fund can be released immediately without waiting for any approval and at the discretion of the Chief Minister.

Ready money

An official from the Relief and Rehabilitation department said, “The Centre’s aid may take more time to arrive and with winter season coming to an end, demand for funds would increase in the coming time. We want to keep the money ready to be disbursed immediately and therefore the limit has been increased.”

The government had said that the Centre’s package would be used for 151 tehsils that had been declared drought-prone first.

Later, drought was declared in 318 revenue circles (each with 15-20 villages) and another 931 villages.

As per the government estimate, 82.27 lakh farmers and 85.76 hectares were hit by drought.

The government, in its proposal to the Centre, had sought ₹7,103 crore as compensation for crop losses, ₹535 crore for fodder supply and ₹323 crore for drinking water supply.",2019-02-13 08:00:00+00:00,"['immediately', 'farmers', 'state', 'contingency', 'limit', 'money', 'drought', 'increased', 'fund', 'waiting', 'aid', 'crore', 'centres', 'fight']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
128,DR-2015-000134-SOM,6 Places Destroyed By Communism Often Blamed On The West And Capitalism - The Libertarian Republic,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/6-places-destroyed-by-communism-often-blamed-on-the-west-and-capitalism/,"Ethiopia

In 1974 a Marxist-Leninist military junta called the Derg seized power in Ethiopia, disposing Dictator Haile Selassie. A one-party communist state was established named the People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The new regime suffered several coups and uprisings, while battling a major drought and a refugee crisis. A brief war with Somalia was won with the aid of the USSR and its allies. The resulting Red Terror was a government retribution campaign of forced deportations, torture, and starvation which claimed nearly half a million lives. In the 1980’s a series of famines which claimed another one million lives led to uprisings against the communist regime. When anti-communist revolutions swept Eastern Europe and communism began to collapse, aid from the USSR ceased. The regime was toppled in 1991, and in 2006 its leader Mengistu Haile Mariam was convicted of in Ethiopian courts of genocide.

Albania

Prior to World War II Albania was invaded and occupied by fascist Italy. When the Axis Powers were defeated, the anti-fascism movement inside Albania had taken on a socialist banner and would fight to establish The People’s Socialist Republic of Albania. After breaking with Yugoslavia in 1948, Albania became dependent on the Soviet Union for aid. The Soviet super-state subsidized economically failing nations like Albania by extracting from other territories. Like most Soviet states, Albania suffered poverty and hardship under socialist rule. Little Albania then became a political pawn in a game between the Chinese and the Soviets, resulting in a distanced relationship with the Soviet Union as Albania became part of China’s sphere of influence. Albania’s socialist government collapsed in 1990, leading to an untenable situation of social strife and desperate conditions. Massive emigration followed, as the strife led to armed conflict in 1997. Despite a rocky road and scandal that marred their first attempt at a democratic government, Albania established another democratic government in 1998 and have slowly been making their way out of the dark ages that socialism left them in.

Somalia

In 1969 the assassination of Somali President Abdi Rashid Ali Shermarke set up a military coup. The new government under Major General Mohamed Siad Barre aligned itself with the Soviet Union. In 1976 the regime created the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party under guidance from the USSR. Soon after they backed a group of Ethiopian revolutionaries, which led to war with Ethiopia. The war was over quickly, Somalia was defeated, and much of its army was destroyed. Having backed a rebellion against an Soviet ally in Ethiopia, Barre was isolated. Struggling with poverty, Barre signed a deal with the International Monetary Fund for aid in the 1980’s which required the privatization of some industries and the end of government monopolies on others. However, as the Cold War drew to an end, the importance of Somalia was diminished to major world players. Barre became increasingly more despotic as the nation grew more isolated. In 1991 civil war broke out leading to Barre’s exile. Under Soviet rule, Somalia became one of the poorest places on the planet, with malnutrition and starvation plaguing the country. To this day it has been unable to recover.

Venezuela

If there is one modern state which best exemplifies the damaging effects of socialism, it’s Venezuela. Modeling after Latin American revolutionary icon Simon Bolivar’s brand of Marxist-Leninism, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez fashioned what is now known as Chavismo, a socialist ideology combined with traditional Latin American Machismo, namely strong, paternal, masculine leadership. Corruption plagued the Chavez regime, as he used intimidation and violence to silence his opponents, held dubious elections, and made alliances with rogue nations like Iran and Cuba. Despite being the largest exporter of oil in the world, Venezuela faces unfathomable poverty. Chavez was obsessed with the failed communist experiment that is Cuba, subsidizing the impoverished island with oil revenues. Chavez oversaw a nationalized oil operation worth untold billions of dollars while the people of Venezuela starved from food shortages. It was common to have millions of dollars unaccounted for, fueling corruption charges. Chavez and the communists of Venezuela maintained they were for the people, most specifically the poor. However, their economic controls have caused misery, famine, disease, and death. Though Chavez died in March of 2013, his successor Nicholas Maduro continued the Chavismo legacy of suffering and despair. Revolutionary movements are growing in resistance, as the government fails to provide its people with basic needs such as food and toilet paper. Recently, the government began finger printing shoppers as a way to combat the black market sale of food. Until the communist are overthrown, they will continue to spend billions from oil revenues to prop up the Venezuelan and Cuban militaries while people starve in the streets.

Cambodia

The Khmer Rouge is infamous for carrying out one of the most vicious genocides of modern history. They did so in the pursuit of a socialist utopia. The bombing of Cambodia as part of the Vietnam War effort by the United States helped contribute to the destabilization of the Cambodian government, which would eventually fall to the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot. Seeking to establish an agrarian socialist society of working class Cambodians, the new regime quickly set upon purging the population. Those with money, foreigners, and those with too much education like doctors and teachers were executed in Pot’s killing fields. The Khmer Rouge had declared it to be Year Zero, society needed to start over, in the fields, and all knowledge of the outside world needed to be purged as well. Even people wearing glasses were killed, as they were seen as intellectuals. Nearly one third of their population was culled in the Cambodian genocide, around 300,000 individuals.

Afghanistan

It is strange to consider that prior to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan the country was budding with Western fashion, nice cars, vacationing Europeans, and commerce. Secularism ruled as boys and girls interacted freely and went to Western style universities to pursue higher knowledge. That all changed when the Soviet Union invaded, causing a 10 year war Afghanistan would never recover from. The war radicalized Muslim leaders inside the nation, who were then armed and trained by the US to counter the Soviet occupation. When the Soviets withdrew in 1989, the radical Sunni Muslim fighters were seen as heroes. The country has never been the same, embracing radical Islam over Western culture, which ultimately led to war with the US following the attacks of September 11th, 2001. Clerics, tribal leaders, and drug lords now run roughshod over Afghanistan. Many blame the US for the troubles now plaguing the nation, however, it was the Soviet war machine that came to Afghanistan for its resources which caused the radicalization that has retrogressed the society to the place we see it today.

Circle of Blue

For the land and water managers working in the aftermath of one of the largest fires in California’s history, the lack of rain and snow – and more significantly the absence of land-ripping thunderstorms – has been a spot of relief in an otherwise bleak and trying year.

Blackened trees and charred homes are misery enough after a destructive blaze. But a severe forest fire also prepares the land for a destructive second act: a flood of muck and debris into streams and reservoirs after a heavy rain. In recent decades large forest fires in the American West, from California to Colorado, have cost water utilities millions of dollars in clean up costs.

The Rim fire burned more than one quarter of a million acres last August in Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park and cost $US 127 million to snuff out. A federal grand jury indicted a hunter last week for accidentally starting the inferno.

Yet the curtain has not lifted on a big second-act flush in the watershed. For that, California’s record drought – which has prompted unprecedented reductions in water availability – is a silver lining.

“The drought has been somewhat beneficial to the watershed,” Mary Moore, a U.S. Forest Service hydrologist working on the Rim fire recovery project, told Circle of Blue. “The rain has been light, wetting rain. That has allowed the seed bank to reestablish.”

The seed bank is the stock of grasses and young trees that begin to push through the denuded soil.

“We’re starting to see green up in the burned area,” Moore said. “There haven’t been any significant effects in degrading the watershed – no gullies or rills.”

Utilities operating in the watershed downstream of the fire are relieved too. No overwhelming cascade of dead trees, brush, and sediment has washed into Don Pedro reservoir, a large manmade lake on the Tuolumne River, said Calvin Curtain, spokesman for Turlock Irrigation District, which operates the dam and reservoir.

“Our biggest concern in relation to the Rim Fire is debris runoff into the reservoir,” Curtain told Circle of Blue. “Fortunately, in this case, we haven’t seen much runoff.”

The district has spent about $US 100,000 to guard mechanical structures in the reservoir from debris, Curtain said.

A Fear of Water

Floods are a problem after a fire for several reasons. First, dead trees and ash can turn streams into a thick cauldron of goo. Fort Collins, Colorado, for instance, sealed its water intake from the Cache la Poudre River in July 2012 after a rainstorm over the recently extinguished High Park fire caused a spike in particulates and a rapid degradation of the watershed.

The second problem occurs if the fire burns with such intensity that it creates a hydrophobic layer of soil that repels water like Teflon.

Image courtesy of U.S. Forest Service A map of the Rim fire with areas classified by how severely the soil burned. High severity burns (shown in red) covered 7 percent of the 103,772 hectares (256,428 acres) that burned. Click image to enlarge.

In the Rim fire, some 7 percent of the burn zone was classified as “high severity.” But roughly 40 percent of the burned acres show hydrophobic soil properties, Moore said.

A week ago Moore was in the field assessing the soil. She found the water-repelling layer at a depth of 2.5 centimeters (1 inch). All of the soil above the hydrophobic coat could potentially wash off.

“One inch is not as scary as three or four,” Moore explained.

Evidence of the flood risk came in late July when one of the few large storms to hit the area parked over Granite Creek. Almost 5 centimeters (2 inches) of rain fell in an hour. Moore said the storm tide overwhelmed a culvert large enough for a grown man to walk through.

Hitting the Utility’s Wallet

Turlock Irrigation District has spent only $US 100,000 responding to the Rim fire. Not every utility gets off so cheaply.

Fires in 1996 and 2002 clogged Strontia Springs reservoir and led Denver Water, the owner, to spend $US 26 million to dredge the facility and reseed the surrounding forest.

In Southern California, a series of storms in 2010 that followed a destructive fire in Angeles National Forest prompted a similar response from Los Angeles County, which spent $US 30 million to clear debris from basins it uses for flood control.

After these experiences, several utilities are taking preemptive action. Denver and Santa Fe are among a growing number of cities that are adding the costs of forest restoration and fire prevention to their water rates. They seek to reduce the risk of a catastrophic fire in the watersheds from which they drink.

The U.S. Forest Service, because it often oversees the land upstream of the reservoirs, usually facilitates the programs and has agreements with Colorado Springs in addition to Denver and Santa Fe.

The Bureau of Reclamation, a large federal water agency, joined the party last June as part of the Western Watershed Enhancement Partnerships, one of President Obama’s many climate change initiatives. River basins in six states – Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Washington – were selected for the program.

These efforts will take time – both to thin forests before a fire and guard against ill effects afterward.

Moore, the U.S. Forest Service hydrologist, said that a watershed takes as many as 10 years to recover from a serious fire. Significant damage to rivers and streams can occur even five or six years after the smoke has cleared.",2014-08-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['soil', 'recovery', 'large', 'drought', 'forest', 'rain', 'service', 'california', 'moore', 'burned', 'helps', 'watershed', 'water', 'rim']",China,news article,English
27,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Himalayas Strike Again: Deadly Landslide in Nepal - Circle of Blue WaterNews,https://www.circleofblue.org/2014/world/nepal-landslide-hydropower/,"Sun Koshi River is blocked, 156 people are dead, and 10 percent of Nepal’s hydropower capacity is cut off.

By Brett Walton, Circle of Blue

The deadliest landslide in Nepal in a decade is raising fresh questions about the country’s ability to use the rivers of the Himalayan range to electrify South Asia.

The disaster on August 2 buried 156 people, covered the main highway to China in mud and debris 20 meters deep, and blocked the Sun Koshi River roughly 80 kilometers east of Kathmandu. Water quickly pooled behind the rubble forming a lake that submerged a small hydropower station three kilometers upstream. The lake poses a flood risk for at least 400,000 people in two countries.

The landslide also damaged a hydropower station downstream and cut electrical transmission lines along the valley. In all, nearly 10 percent of the nation’s hydropower capacity, some 67 megawatts, was severed by the landslide, leading to power cuts in the capital and elsewhere in the country of 27 million people.

It is the second time in a year that a mammoth disaster ripped the region’s high mountain passes, causing deaths, vast damage to roads and other infrastructure, and ravaging hydropower installations. In June 2013 wicked flooding in Uttarakhand, an Indian state that lies across Nepal’s western border, killed at least 6,000 people and seriously damaged at least 10 big hydropower projects in operation and under construction. Another 19 small hydropower projects that generate under 25 megawatts were destroyed.

“I’ve been a hydropower skeptic for a long time…This idea that we will become like Arab sheikhs lolling in hydro-dollars is absolute nonsense.” –Dipak Gyawali,

Nepal’s minister of water resources, 2002-03

Nepal’s Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has not yet determined the cause of the landslide. The region, with its young geology, seismic activity, steep slopes, and intense cloudbursts, has a thick history of earth-moving events. Factors being investigated include seasonal rainfall, road construction in the area, and a slope weakened by previous slides.

Land and water experts, and former government officials, said that the Nepal landslide was a warning to the landlocked country squeezed between the soft slope of the Ganges plain and the spiky pinnacles of the Himalayas. The disaster, they said, should prompt Nepal to reassess its push for large Himalayan hydropower dams.

Optimistic projections estimate that Nepal’s undeveloped hydropower potential is second highest in the world, behind Brazil. Both China and India have cast a hopeful glance at their neighbor’s deep, dammable canyons. Nepal’s energy ministry set a goal in 2010 of building 37,000 megawatts of new hydropower capacity within 20 years, a goal that now looks impossible to achieve after a slow start and just 705 megawatts operating today.

But calamities such as the Sun Koshi landslide could undo these hydropower plans, Dave Petley, a landslide expert at Durham University, told Circle of Blue. Landslides in the Himalayas are growing more frequent and severe as the globe warms and intense rainfall increases, he said, adding that human interventions – such as building roads, tearing down forests, and stripping the soil – magnify the natural hazards.

Others surveying the damage do not see a hydropower kingdom rising in the Himalayan foothills.

“I’ve been a hydropower skeptic for a long time,” Dipak Gyawali, Nepal’s minister of water resources from 2002 to 2003, told Circle of Blue. “Nepal is not rich in hydropower. I don’t know where the hype came in, perhaps from developers. This idea that we will become like Arab sheikhs lolling in hydro-dollars is absolute nonsense.”

A Mountain Falls into a River

Nepal’s unstable terrain and steep river valleys that shudder from earth-moving forces are risky locations for hydropower projects, experts say. These projects could fail in any number of disasters common to this region – earthquakes, landslides, or torrential floods.

Some of those risks were revealed just after sunrise on August 2 when nearly two kilometers of hillside collapsed above the Araniko highway, Nepal’s main road link with China.u on August 5, 2014. In the foreground is the Sun Koshi hydropower station, which was damaged in the landslide.

An engineer for the Bhote Koshi hydropower station, located just upstream, who witnessed the slide, tweeted that “a whole mountain has fallen into the river.”

Dozens of homes were buried. By Wednesday morning 33 bodies had been recovered and 123 people were still missing but assumed dead, according to local news reports.

Scientists with the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), a research group based in Kathmandu, are helping Nepal’s Department of Hydrology and Meteorology assess the causes of the landslide.

However, access to the site is difficult and a detailed investigation right now is not likely, said Arun Shrestha, manager of ICIMOD’s river basin program.

Shrestha told Circle of Blue that three main questions must be answered in the next few days: Will the hillside collapse again? What can be done to stabilize the slope? How stable is the landslide dam across the Sun Koshi River?

The nature of the dam, comprised of rock, mud, and sediment, is the greatest concern, Shrestha said.

The Nepali Army is blasting holes in the dam to drain the water. If the dam were to break, the resulting flood, called a bishyari in Nepali, would put as many as 400,000 people at risk. The threat extends beyond national borders. Authorities in India’s Bihar state, more than 200 kilometers downstream on the Kosi River, have evacuated at least 65,000 people.

Landslide Points to Long-term Problems

Landslides are common in Nepal. Shrestha counts 14 major events since 1967. But what is unusual about the Sun Koshi landslide is that it happened in an area with major infrastructure: the Araniko highway and five hydropower stations.

The hydropower stations along the river do not use large dams. Rather, they are small facilities, no more than 45 megawatts, that divert a portion of the river’s flow to generate electricity before returning it to the channel downstream. Still, one station’s diversion pipes were damaged, another was inundated, and the rest are inoperable because of downed transmission lines.

“This is an eye-opener for hydropower,” Shrestha said. “Development has to happen more systematically. Now there is not so much consideration for natural hazards.”

Shrestha mentioned the catastrophic June 2013 floods in Uttarakhand as another example of natural hazards limiting national hydropower plans. But cautious development in Nepal will be easier wished than accomplished, asserted Gyawali, the former water resources minister.

When asked which authorities were responsible for approving hydropower permits, Gyawali scoffed at the question.

“I am afraid these questions arise in your mind conflating Nepal with Norway,” he wrote in an email. “We have a dominating informal sector where policies are made and decisions are taken at the household level. Yes, government has policies. Can they effectively implement it? Well, more easily on the moon than in next-to-inaccessible Nepali hinterlands.”

If the authorities want, the Sun Koshi example can serve as a guide for hydropower development, said Gyawali, who is now research director of the Nepal Water Conservation Foundation.

“These bishyaris keep happening all the time,” Gyawali said, referring to the floods from landslide dams. “Nepal is better off developing small hydropower plants across the country. If we try to build one single plant, we’re putting a larger risk on the table. Many smaller ones cannot all be knocked out.”

Petley, the Durham University landslide expert, said that more research on natural hazards in the Himalayas is needed.

“The Himalayan landscape needs to be managed very carefully,” Petley said. “There is too much indiscriminate development.”",2014-08-06 07:00:00+00:00,"['himalayas', 'development', 'hydropower', 'koshi', 'megawatts', 'nepals', 'strike', 'landslide', 'nepal', 'water', 'deadly', 'river', 'gyawali']",China,news article,English

622,Drought Sri Lanka,Paddy fields in Battambang rescued from drought - The Phnom Penh Post,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/paddy-fields-battambang-rescued-drought,"Paddy fields in Battambang rescued from drought

Officials said that the nearly 20,000ha of paddy fields in Battambang’s Sangke district that faced drought have been rescued, with parts of the province receiving some rain recently.

Chhim Vichara, the director of the provincial agricultural department, said on Tuesday that although some 18,000ha of paddy fields in Sangke district had dried up last week, they had not died.

The Sangke district paddy fields were rescued in time, and while other districts also lacked water, his department had not announced a drought alert, Vichara said.

“This happened last week but only affected paddy fields in Sangke district. Our team is getting water into the fields and it rained over the past few days, so there is no problem,” he said.

Long Phalkun, the director of the Battambang provincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology, said none of the rice paddies had died from drought after water was released into them.

“We released water from the main canals into the paddy fields one after another. The situation is okay now,” Phalkun said.

Provincial governor Nguon Ratanak said on Tuesday that paddy in the Sangke district fields had withered slightly, but there had been no reports of adverse effects after authorities released water into them and it had rained.

“There have been showers. There is not a lot of water in the fields but the paddy has not died. In short, paddy fields have dried up but there is no drought. Rice has withered but not died,” Ratanak said.

A farmer, 60-year-old Oeun Suy from Moung Russey district’s Kakoh commune in Battambang province, told the local media Apsara News Network (ANN) that his family farmed 5ha of paddy fields. These normally produced good yields as it had rained enough in previous years.

However, he said he and other farmers were experiencing drought this year, and that his commune had seen only sporadic rain for months. If this continued, he said, thousands of hectares of paddy fields were at risk.

“If the drought continues until early July, it is clear that rice plants will die because now the only irrigation canal is without water,” Suy told ANN.",2019-06-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['rescued', 'water', 'died', 'drought', 'fields', 'released', 'rice', 'district', 'sangke', 'battambang', 'paddy']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
315,FF-2016-000062-IDN,China: New Bank's Projects Should Respect Rights - Human Rights Watch,https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/24/china-new-banks-projects-should-respect-rights,"(New York) – The China-founded Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) should create a robust, independent accountability body to investigate rights abuses linked to its projects, Human Rights Watch said today. The AIIB, established in June 2015, convenes its first annual general meeting in Beijing on June 25-26, 2016. It is set to approve a new round of projects at the meeting.

The AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and Operating Policies note the need to address the bank’s environmental and social impacts and to establish an oversight mechanism to ensure “transparency, openness, independence, and accountability.” The bank’s environmental and social framework emphasizes its aim, through the projects it finances, to encourage respect for human rights. However, the AIIB’s safeguard policies do not require the bank to identify and address human rights risks in the projects it finances, which is necessary for the bank to realize this vision, Human Rights Watch said. Nor has the bank publicly addressed whether it will consult with nongovernmental groups, particularly in countries hostile to independent monitors.



“The AIIB has a chance to get right what other development banks have repeatedly gotten wrong by ensuring that its operations won’t undermine human rights,” said Jessica Evans, senior international financial institutions advocate at Human Rights Watch. “To achieve that, the bank will need to identify and address human rights risks linked to its projects.”



The AIIB, whose first loans have already been announced, intends to fund infrastructure development across Asia. China is its founder and largest shareholder. Other members include Australia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. About a dozen of the bank’s member countries regularly express concerns about China’s human rights record and about abuses linked to economic development projects.



Human Rights Watch research on development banks globally has documented forced evictions, violations of indigenous peoples’ rights, reprisals against critics, and discrimination in the distribution of aid.

To achieve that, the bank will need to identify and address human rights risks linked to its projects. Jessica Evans Senior Researcher/Advocate for International Financial Institutions

Human Rights Watch expressed its concerns about transparency, accountability, and engaging civil society in two letters to the bank’s leadership in August 2015, noting China’s weak track record on transparency and rights-respecting development processes. No replies have been received. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly expressed concerns about the deteriorating human rights environment in China under President Xi Jinping.



“China’s poor record on participation of independent groups and on peaceful criticism means that other bank member countries will need to press the bank to address rights concerns,” Evans said.



The bank has made a commitment to establish an oversight body in line with principles of transparency, openness, independence, and accountability. The body should be able to investigate, report, and recommend remedies for rights abuses linked to its projects, as well as violations of bank safeguard policies. Bank members should ensure that this body’s policies and practices reflects lessons learned by accountability mechanisms at other international financial institutions, including by:

Ensuring it can function independently of pressure from AIIB management and political influence;

Including representatives of nongovernmental groups on the selection committee for members of the mechanism;

Requiring the bank to develop responsive, time-bound plans to respond to rights abuses and findings that it has not complied with its own policies; and

Providing the mechanism with the mandate to monitor and publicly report on whether rights abuses and policy violations have been remedied.

The AIIB should not approve any more projects until its accountability mechanism is up and running, Human Rights Watch said.



“Without strong commitments to respecting human rights in all AIIB activities and a meaningful mechanism to hold the bank to account, this new lender may do more harm than good,” Evans said. “But if all members insist on higher standards, it could raise the bar globally for sustainable, rights-respecting development.”",2016-06-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['banks', 'accountability', 'watch', 'human', 'china', 'rights', 'policies', 'projects', 'bank', 'development', 'aiib', 'respect']",India,news article,English

Please note: Due to a flood warning, Route 10 will be closed from Monday, except for the section between Ezuz and Mount Harif junction.

Closed to civilian traffic for most of the year, the road was opened Friday for Hanukkah, and will remain open through Saturday, December 19. In recent years, the highway has only been opened during holidays, to enable travelers to enjoy the view and have easier access to the fascinating Mount Karkom site.

Driving along Route 10, you can reach stunning sites such as the Kadesh Barnea observation point, 670 meters above sea level, where you can gaze at northern Sinai, and the Har Hursha lookout that offers a wonderful view north toward Kadesh Barnea, and northeast toward Ramat Barnea and Mount Hamran. The view to the west is even more enticing, as you look over the border into Sinai.

With binoculars you can clearly make out the area of Ein al-Qudeirat, which some believe is the site of the biblical Kadesh Barnea – a large oasis where the Israelites dwelled for a long time during their wanderings in the desert following the exodus from Egypt. Another marvelous lookout – which faces west toward Sinai and the winding border fence – is 11 kilometers south of the Har Hursha lookout, slightly south of Border Marker 47, several hundred meters south of the memorial to Capt. Orion Salomon and Tal Tzuri, who died in a flight training accident in 1980.

Another interesting stop along the route is the Sabha cistern, about 1 kilometer down a dirt road east of the highway. The ancient water cistern, apparently from the Nabatean period 2,000 years ago, leads to an underground pool. It is filled with water year-round and on hot days, you can take a dip. Typically for the Nabateans, the cistern is well-hidden. It’s not easy to find if you don’t know of its existence. It’s currently covered with a sheet of tin that can be easily removed.

Mount Harif junction is 55 kilometers south of Nitzana Junction. The mountain rises to an elevation of 1,000 meters, though the highway is 200 meters below. From here you can continue south toward Mount Karkom and Eilat or turn east onto Route 171 and drive 40 kilometers north to Mitzpeh Ramon.

Off-road adventure

The opening of Route 10 gives those with 4X4 off-road vehicles a relatively comfortable way to reach Mount Karkom, one of the most intriguing sites in Israel. The rest of the year, the only way to reach Mount Karkom is from the northeast, via a very long off-road drive from the direction of Mitzpeh Ramon. During Hanukkah, one can drive down Route 10 then turn east and drive off-road for just 10 kilometers to reach Mount Karkom.

Travel on Route 10 will be permitted from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., and strict safety rules will be enforced: driving on marked routes only, in accordance with road conditions and not along the border fence. There are military posts spread out along the route for security and guidance. ID must be presented in order to enter the route. Photographing the border fence is prohibited. There are no gas stations along the route, so fill the tank ahead of time. Overnight camping is permitted only in approved campgrounds. Vehicles may not be left unsupervised. Littering is prohibited, to protect the wildlife. The area near the route is a military zone with training grounds. Touching unexploded ordnance or ammunition is strictly forbidden: If you come across any, you must report it to the Israel Defense Forces. In many areas along the route, there is no cellular reception.

UN-ASG / Director-General African Risk Capacity, Mohamed Beavogui and HE Adriano Afonso Maleiane, Mozambique’s Minister of Economy and Finance during one of the discussions leading to the signing of the MoU

Maputo, May 15, 2019 – The African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency and the Government of Mozambique have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to provide mid to long-term solutions against the recurrent episodes of drought, floods, and tropical cyclones in the country.

The MoU serves as “a framework to facilitate cooperation and collaboration between the ARC Agency and the Government, and to define the terms and conditions under which the Government and the ARC Agency will work together to address the impact of Extreme Climate Events on Mozambique, including through support provided by the ARC Agency for Mozambique, training of Government officials and other efforts in support of Mozambique objectives.”

Mozambique, which is emerging from two tropical cyclones, is vulnerable to climate change because of its location and geography which expose large areas of the country to tropical cyclones, droughts (every three to four years) and river/coastal storm surge flooding. This vulnerability is heightened by the country’s 2,470 km of coastline and socioeconomic fragility which puts infrastructure, coastal agriculture, key ecosystems and fisheries at risk.

Speaking about the signing of the MoU, the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and Director-General of ARC, Mohamed Beavogui indicated that the aim is to work with the Government of Mozambique to understand its own risk profile vis-à-vis the various perils facing the country and develop customised response plans. “ARC is a Development Insurance Mechanism which links risk profiling, contingency planning and a payout. “Although insurance will never cover all the risks associated with a peril in each country, the ARC approach allows for the risks to be managed in a way that multiplies the benefits from limited resources available to Government. Therefore, helping to save more lives and livelihoods at the early stage of a disaster…before the arrival of humanitarian assistance…,” ASG Beavogui stated. “The Government of the Mozambique appreciates the onset of formal collaboration with the African Risk Capacity” said HE Adriano Afonso Maleiane, Mozambique’s Minister of Economy and Finance. “We expect that the MoU will initial a well-coordinated take-off of activities towards strengthening the capacities of our climate management authority officials as well as other personnel to better understand our risk profile and provide quicker responses in the event of natural disasters,” he concluded.

Under the MoU, the Government of Mozambique and the ARC Agency will work together through the Program to prepare for the potential participation of the Government as an ARC Ltd member. At the end of the Program, the Government will decide whether to participate in ARC Ltd and its level of participation.

Government involvement in the Program does not commit it to participate in ARC Ltd but rather support an informed decision-making process on climate risk insurance.

1443,FL-2019-000179-CAN,"Flooding, flooding everywhere – do Canadians have insurance for it? - Globalnews.ca",https://globalnews.ca/news/3425571/flood-insurance-canada/,"Send this page to someone via email

From New Brunswick to Quebec, through Ontario, Manitoba and to British Columbia, Canadians have been coping with flooding or bracing for torrential downpours.

And yet, flood insurance is still a relatively new concept in the Great White North.

Overland flood insurance, which covers damage from water flowing above ground and seeping in through windows, doors and cracks, only became widely available in the last couple of years, according to Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

Until then, Canada was the only country in the G8 group of advanced economies not to offer overland insurance. That was because flooding used to be such a rare occurrence in this country, said Feltmate.

But that all changed in June 2013, when heavy rainfall in Calgary turned into the worst flooding in Alberta’s history.

Floods became more frequent in Canada and the problem is only going to grow worse due to climate change, Feltmate told Global News.

WATCH: Here’s why cities flood more easily than rural areas

0:27 Here’s why cities flood more easily than rural areas Here’s why cities flood more easily than rural areas – May 5, 2017

“Part of the reason we’ve seen insurance companies offer flood coverage is that there’s a demand now because people are seeing that from the Calgary floods [onwards],” Pete Karageorgos of the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), which represents Canada’s private home insurers, explained.

The average damage from severe weather stands at $400 million in Canada per year. That’s up from $100 million before 2008-2009, according to Karageorgos.

Urban flooding alone resulted in over $20 billion in damage over the ten-year period between 2003 and 2012, according to the federal government.

Here’s what homeowners need to know:

Who should be worrying about flooding? Pretty much everyone across Canada, according to Feltmate.

You don’t need to live close to a creek, river or lake to be at risk, he said.

Flooding often happens because cities’ sewage systems become backed up and start overflowing into basement drains, Feltmate noted.

Flooded basements replaced house fires as the most expensive source of home insurance claims in the 1990s, according to a study on climate change adaptation that Feltmate chaired in 2012.

Homes located in downstream and low-lying areas are particularly exposed, Feltmate said.

Make sure you’re covered

There are two major types of insurance against flooding: regular flood insurance and overland flood insurance.

Provinces don’t regulate these types of insurance so pricing depends on the provider, your address and your property, said Feltmate.

“The first tip or trick is to shop around,” said Karageorgos.

“It’s a very competitive environment […] so don’t assume they operate in the same way,” he added.

It’s also important to read the fine print and be aware of whether there is a cap on the amount of damage covered, said Feltmate.

A flooded basement costs an average of $42,000 in major cities – and not all insurers will cover 100 per cent of the damage, he noted.

Flood insurance

This kind of coverage has long been available in Canada but it isn’t necessarily included in regular home insurance. Many Canadians don’t know that they’re not covered when floods happen, Feltmate said.

Much attention has focused on the need for overland flood insurance in the aftermath of the Calgary floods. But plain-vanilla flood insurance is what you need to protect you from the risk of sewer back-up.

Overland flood insurance

Not every insurance provider offers coverage for overland flooding, said Karageorgos, so that’s another reason to take a look at multiple home insurers.

If you aren’t covered or can’t get insurance

Across the country, many Canadians are finding out that their homes either can’t be insured against flooding or that premiums are so high they can’t afford to buy coverage, Feltmate said.

This is mostly the case for older homes built in areas where the risk of flooding has become extremely high, he explained.

Homeowners who don’t have insurance coverage can still make a claim with the federal Emergency Management Office of the Public Safety Minister.

Citizens can apply for Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, which are funded by the federal government but distributed by the provincial government.

How to protect your home from flooding

Flooding is very stressful and disruptive even if you have insurance. There are several easy and low-cost steps you can take to reduce that risk in your home:

Story continues below advertisement

Make sure all downspouts discharge at least three metres away from your home’s foundations

Ensure sewer grates are open and clear away debris like dirty and leaves

Place plastic covers over window wells

When it’s raining, go out and inspect your house to see if water is pooling anywhere around it. If it is, regrade the perimeter of your home so that water flows away from it

Install one or more sump-pumps, which remove water that accumulates in the so-called sump basement, generally found in basements. You should also have 10 hours’ worth of battery backups to make sure they will continue to work even in case of a blackout, which often happens in conjunction with flooding

You might also need a backwater valve, which helps to prevent flooding from sewer backup. These valves cost between $2,500 and $3,000 but many municipalities offer large subsidies for homeowners who decide to buy one

More information can be found on the Public Safety Ministry’s Flood Ready webpage.

How to mitigate the damage

What do you do if you’ve already been flooded? The first step is to document what’s been damaged.

“A lot of times individuals, if they’re faced with flooding in their basements, they start throwing things out. And if they do have insurance policies that cover them for damage they want to document what is part of the claim… furniture, appliances, carpet or hardwood flooring,” Karageorgos said.

It’s also useful to inventory your basement beforehand, he explained, so you can check if your policy will have enough coverage for all the things that could be damaged – as well as accounting for disposal and replacing.

Oklahoma City set a record for the number of days in a year with temperatures above 100 providing perfect conditions for fires

A wildfire that sparked in a wooded area forced panicked horse owners to turn their livestock loose as they evacuated the area in Oklahoma City yesterday.



Before being contained, the raging fire caused swathes of cedar trees to explode into flame as the wind-whipped blaze reached them in the North-East of the city.



Oklahoma City set a record for the number of days in a year with temperatures above 100 and t he near unrelenting heat wave this summer meant conditions were ideal for grass fires.

Dee Corley, a stable owner in a nearby area, took in horses that had been evacuated while an employee picked up wandering strays to prevent traffic accidents.

She took in 25 horses as well as 11 dogs and two cats before the fire was eventually contained late on last night.

She refused to accept payment but was considering taking hay donations.

She said: 'I'm just glad I can help. That's what it's all about,'

Southerly winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour along with low humidity and drought conditions made the wildfire difficult to contain and 15 properties were thought to have been destroyed.

About 200 fire fighters kept the blaze from spreading north to more populated areas while two National Guard helicopters dumped water on the fire.



Neighbouring cities and counties also sent reinforcements.

192,Drought Sri Lanka,La Paz is short of water as Bolivia suffers its worst drought in 25 years - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-04/la-paz-short-water-bolivia-s-suffers-its-worst-drought-25-years,"Bolivia’s dried-out Ajuan Khota dam, a reservoir affected by drought near La Paz, was photographed on Nov. 17.

The rugged Dakar Rally auto race is about to blaze through Bolivia. But to many Bolivians, the timing could not be worse.

Thousands of La Paz residents have been protesting these days. Now they’re also shouting online with the hashtag #AguaSíDakarNo — “yes to water, no to Dakar.” In other words, they wish authorities would pay more attention to a deepening water crisis.

Jan. 8 will mark two whole months of a water shortage in La Paz. Bolivia’s government says the country is suffering from its worst drought in 25 years. It’s gotten so bad that President Evo Morales declared a national state of emergency, tightened up water rationing, fired a top water official and drew up infrastructure projects to remediate the crisis.

Some blame foreign mines near one of La Paz’s reservoirs for allegedly sucking up the supply. Some blame bad government planning. Others say this is climate change — including shrinking glaciers — bearing down on one of the world’s highest cities. The reality is possibly a combination of all three.

Problem is, droughts and water conflicts are not just affecting South America. They’re popping up anywhere from California to Syria to India — and, with populations growing and the climate changing, struggles over H2O are forecast to get a lot worse. Water is being called the new oil of the century, and some even predict international water wars to erupt over the next decades.

Fortunately for Bolivia, war has not broken out. But this current crisis in the Andes could be a bellwether for the Americas and beyond.

The government knows the glaciers are receding — by over 40 percent since 1985, according to one recent study. And it’s not just in Bolivia; Peru, Ecuador and Colombia are also losing ice cover. Bolivian cities get some of their water from glacial supplies, especially during dry months. Critics say the Bolivian government has failed to take measures to secure alternative water supplies.

Morales’ government, however, claims protesters are hyping up the water crisis to foment opposition to his 10-year rule.

Dicey water delivery?

Rationing has hit more than 100 neighborhoods and affected about 400,000 people in La Paz and the neighboring city of El Alto.

Trucks bring water every three to four days for residents to fill just two containers at a time.

However, the La Paz Medical Association has advised that the water be filtered and treated with bleach before it’s consumed. That’s because of media reports that the same delivery trucks were previously used for carrying gasoline and diesel.

The head of a fuel company reportedly acknowledged his trucks were being used, but claimed the company followed rigorous cleaning protocols before filling them up with water.

Officials at Bolivia’s water and sanitation agency did not answer requests for comment.

Many in La Paz have no other option but to drink the allegedly tainted water. Not everyone can simply buy bottled water to meet their daily needs.

Yet the crisis is taking a toll on families, regardless of their income. Even the city’s more affluent south side is having rough times because of it — a rare case for Latin American elites.

A history of water woes

The resource-rich country is no stranger to water conflict. Back in 2000, a popular uprising took water management away from private hands after deadly clashes with government security forces in the city of Cochabamba.

Even though Cochabamba residents are now better prepared, by collecting rainwater, the city and other areas continue to face shortages.

Lake Poopó, once Bolivia's second-largest lake, dried out last year, as these NASA images show. Climate has taken part of the blame.

“This is a picture of the future of climate change,” German glaciologist Dirk Hoffman told The Associated Press at the start of 2016.

Authorities and environmentalists also point to another factor: Mining sped up the depletion of the Desaguadero River that fed the lake.

According to Paola Cortés, an environmental lawyer in La Paz, large-scale gold extraction swallowed and polluted the river since the 1980s without any oversight.

And in another city, Potosí, Cortés recalls a recent scandal where countless truckloads of the public’s water were being sold to mining firms, reportedly for about 1,000 to 2,000 bolivianos (US$145 to $290) each.

Spilling over borders

Making matters worse, Bolivia is waging a water war with Chile in the International Court of Justice.

In June, the Morales government sued Chile at The Hague for channeling water from Bolivia’s Silala spring. Chile argues the water flows naturally downhill to its territory. The Chilean state-owned mining company and many private mining firms have been using the water for years.

The case is expected to take months, if not years, to be resolved.

But in the meantime, water problems are affecting both countries.

Take Calama, a city in Chile’s Atacama Desert that’s home to many of the region’s copper miners. “Water is not for sale!” reads a local mural. But water polluted with arsenic from the mines flows out of local household faucets.

How about the Rio Grande?

About 4,000 miles north, Mexico and the US have some issues, too. Water-sharing agreements for resources reaching eight states as far up as Wyoming could see turmoil — particularly with the incoming administration of Donald Trump, as Politico reported.

Lori Kuczmanski, foreign affairs secretary at the International Boundary and Water Commission, which oversees the treaties, says she expects work to continue as usual despite administration changes.

""We are looking for ways to cooperate together in the case of a drought contingency,"" Kuczmanski says.

Still, Lake Mead, in Arizona and Nevada, has registered historic lows recently and the Rio Grande is frequently at risk of drought — which could all affect the supply for thousands.

It all raises questions about how to better administer this crucial resource going forward. Residents want better government oversight. But plenty of countries rely on private management. Experts say the effectiveness of either model depends on water availability more than financial support.

Ryan Stoa at the Florida International University College of Law suggests local administration of water resources is a better route. Transferring authority to decentralized agencies specializing in water could improve small-scale management. Stoa calls it “subsidiarity”: making laws and regulating them at the lowest governance level “to promote efficiency and local ownership over policies and regulations.”

Meanwhile, observers say Bolivia needs improvement regulating, whether on the private- or public-sector side.

As for the Dakar Rally, its director Marc Coma has reportedly ordered six truckloads of water brought in for the competition.

“We decided to transport, from Argentina, our own water in enormous tanker trucks,” Coma said according to El Periódico newspaper, “so Bolivia won't have to worry about us.”",2017-01-05 08:00:00+00:00,"['running', 'dangerously', 'mining', 'bolivia', 'residents', 'low', 'paz', 'city', 'private', 'water', 'drought', 'glaciers', 'la', 'say', 'melting', 'bolivias']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Local officials blame the mass deaths on drought but critics say the issue at least partly stems from water mismanagement.

Hundreds of thousands of fish have died in the third mass kill on a stretch of a major Australian river in recent weeks that local officials blame on drought but critics say at least partly stems from water mismanagement.

The latest deaths began Sunday night in the Darling River near the township of Menindee in western New South Wales state.

That's the same area where hundreds of thousands of fish were found floating dead in early January and shortly before Christmas.

The suspected cause is hot weather leading to an algal bloom that has starved the water of oxygen.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian blamed an extended drought.

But Menindee Regional Tourist Association president Rob Gregory says officials let farmers take too much water for irrigation.

1798,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Madagascar: Businesses drive disappearance of a wetland 'reed forest' - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/madagascar-businesses-drive-disappearance-of-a-wetland-reed-forest/,"Lake Alaotra and its surrounding marshes are Madagascar’s largest wetland, a Ramsar Site that is home to globally significant biodiversity.

Despite layers of legal protection and conservation programming, around 850 hectares (2,100 acres) of marsh disappear each year to make way for rice cultivation, much of it perpetrated by businesses.

Local people are keenly feeling the lake’s decline, though, and a commitment to protecting it, along with some success stories, persist in pockets around its shores.

The government is implementing a zero-tolerance campaign against illegal environmental destruction, but it remains to be seen whether this can reduce the lawlessness and impunity enough to safeguard the lake.

LAKE ALAOTRA, Madagascar — Madagascar’s environment minister, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, celebrated World Wetlands Day last month by planting native reeds and sedges along the shore of sprawling Lake Alaotra in the country’s central highlands. The plants’ tufted tops waved high above the heads of students, officials and local residents as they carried them across the marsh and joined the minister in settling them, one by one, into the mucky ground.

The planting on Feb. 2, which covered 4 hectares (10 acres), was an attempt to revitalize a tiny portion of the lake’s marshland that people call the “reed forest” in Malagasy. Rice agriculture, overfishing, introduced species and siltation due to upland deforestation have all contributed to the striking decline of a wetland the minister described in a Facebook post the next day as being among the largest and most ecologically important not just in Madagascar, but in all of Africa.

“Unfortunately, this marsh is now completely destroyed and Lake Alaotra is drying up,” she wrote. “Many species of Alaotra are endangered.”

Despite layers of legal protection and conservation programming, sources say much of the destruction is being perpetuated by businesses involved in rice growing and fishing and by widespread defiance of protective laws. Local people are keenly feeling the lake’s decline, though, and a commitment to protecting it, along with some success stories, persist in pockets around its shores.

A natural jewel

With 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of open water surrounded by an equal area of marsh, Lake Alaotra is a natural jewel. It is home to globally significant biodiversity, including several endemic species of fish and birds and unusual mammals, such as the mongoose-like carnivore Durrell’s vontsira (Salanoia durrelli), which scientists only described in 2010, and the critically endangered bandro or Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis).

With some 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of rice fields surrounding the lake, the vast Alaotra wetland is Madagascar’s main rice bowl, yielding an average of 360,000 tons of rice annually, or around 10% of the nation’s annual yield.

The lake was also once the country’s biggest inland fish supplier. But annual catches have declined precipitously, from around 2,400 tons in 2000 to barely 330 tons in 2020, according to the regional fishing department. Locals feel the loss acutely.

“I was 10 years old in 1973. We just spent a half-hour to harvest about 100 kilos [220 pounds] of quality fishes at the time,” said Randriamatsarasoa, a fisher and head of the fishers’ community association in Vohitsivalana, a village in the commune of Imerimandroso on the lake’s northeastern shore. “Nowadays, we struggle to bring home 5 to 12 kilos [11-26 pounds] after working hard from the morning to the evening.”

Such a significant shift in resource availability has resulted in fierce competition among residents that only exacerbates the ecosystem’s decline.

“These marshes represent the remaining history of the Alaotra region,” said Honoré Randriangalisa, the mayor of Imerimandroso and a deputy president of Alaotra Rano Soa, a regional body that facilitates communities’ management of the lake and marshes. “Their existence will be only a legend for the next generations if we are unable to put a stop to their destruction right now.”

Due to its importance for biodiversity and Madagascar’s agro-economy, Alaotra’s 722,500-hectare (1.78-million-acre) watershed was inscribed as a Ramsar Site under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance in 2003. The Madagascar government designated a temporary new protected area there in 2007 and granted 46,000 hectares (114,000 acres) permanent protection in 2015.

The transformation of marshland into new rice fields is the main threat to the marshes and the lake’s health. In recent years, rice farmers have been planting vary jeby, or flood recession rice, pushing into flood-prone areas that are now often farmable during the dry season, which has become elongated by climate change. They may farm a plot for a few years then leave it fallow when conditions aren’t ideal.

“The rising trend in the reliance on the flood recession rice is a very big issue,” said Miora Ratsimanohatra, chief of the agricultural engineering division for the wider Alaotra-Mangoro region, where Lake Alaotra is located. “People clear the temporarily dried up marshes and set them on fire to cultivate them. They even go beyond the protected area’s boundaries. This is illegal.”

Compounding the problems, centuries of deforestation have eliminated the tropical forest that once encircled the lake. Annual rains now carry tons of red earth from the surrounding terrain via deep, eroded gullies to submerge the lowlands, rivers and the lake itself. Moreover, the extended dry seasons, now lasting from June to November or December, have diminished the lake’s water. Today, the lake has a maximum depth during the dry season of just 2.5 meters (8 feet).

Last year, the extended dry season and higher temperatures than usual resulted in widespread and devastating bushfires that began in July and continued to late December, according to Fidimalala Bruno Ralainasolo, the conservation biologist who runs the Alaotra program of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT). The Jersey Island-based NGO has been active at the lake since 1996.

Altogether, around 850 hectares (2,100 acres) of marsh are lost every year, reducing their total cover by as much as 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) since 2005, to the present 20,000-hectare extent, according to Ralainasolo. “Only around 20% of this inland ecosystem remains untapped,” he said.

Contrasting conservation

In 2015, as part of the government’s designation of the Alaotra protected area, DWCT started a conservation program in collaboration with Alaotra Rano Soa. The regional body, established as part of the lake’s Ramsar designation, helps oversee activities relating to the lake, such as rice growing, fishing, aquaculture, goose and cattle husbandry, water management, tourism, crafts, and transportation, at the community level. Alaotra Rano Soa manages the sprawling Ramsar site while DWCT manages the smaller protected area within it.

DWCT and Alaotra Rano Soa established four activity sectors to provide a forum for local people to manage the Ramsar site: 45 commune-level federations that collectively involve 333 village-level community associations, each one active in either watershed protection, water-resource management, fisheries management or marsh conservation. The program employs 96 polisin-jetra, or marsh police agents, as its ambassadors in the protected area. They report any environmental violations to DWCT, but can’t make arrests.

In 2017, DWCT, Alaotra Rano Soa and government authorities publicly marked the limits of the protected area. Parcels totaling nearly 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of marshland were set aside for the use of local communities, who rely on the lake’s resources for foods and income. However, with some exceptions, this area has largely succumbed to commercial rice planting, forcing subsistence farmers into protected marshland to meet their needs.

“The biggest issue we were facing was the fact that local businesses managed to control 90% of the set-aside 7,000 hectares, instead of the community members,” said Ralainasolo, the DWCT conservation biologist.

Two of the lake’s rural communes offer a study in contrasts when it comes to managing their slices of set-aside marsh. Imerimandroso’s marsh cover is on the verge of disappearance, whereas its neighbor on the northeastern lake shore, Andrebakely Avaratra, has retained most of its marsh. Like the dozens of communes around the wetland, Imerimandroso and Andrebakely Avaratra, with respective populations of around 16,000 and 19,900, rely on rice growing, farming, fishing and crafting for their food and income. For centuries, the lake has provided people’s daily needs.

Of the 400 or so hectares (about 1,000 acres) the marsh community association in Imerimandroso is responsible for, scarcely a dozen persist, and the local businesses and subsistence farmers who grow vary jeby are clamoring for access even to these.

“Little by little, they invaded the protected area as of 2008,” Dauphin Andriakotoarivony, deputy mayor of Imerimandroso and a deputy president of Alaotra Rano Soa, said. “Hardly 7 hectares [17 acres] of the initial 209 [516 acres] we have secured where I am [in Marovato sector] has been left. Practically 99% of the protected area is ruined. Also, the rest is already prone to invasion. The encouraging thing is that the community association has never abandoned the fight.”

Randriamatsarasoa, the fisher from Imerimandroso, is very concerned with the eventual exhaustion of the fish stocks. According to him, the introduced tilapia (several species in the family Cichlidae) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) that were once abundant in Lake Alaotra and are the main source of income for local fishers have declined precipitously, having long since displaced native fish species. He attributes the disappearance of the fish to people using insecticide-laced mosquito nets with small meshes that scoop up juveniles, and clearing marshes where fish and other aquatic animals reproduce.

“When the water is well managed, I can tell you that fishing is more profitable than rice growing,” he said. A kilo of freshwater fish now costs seven or eight times more than a kilo of rice.

The failure of the marsh conservation project in Imerimandroso was attributable to political leadership, according to Ralainasolo of DWCT. He said the commune’s previous mayor was under a great deal of pressure from local powerbrokers to permit illegal marsh clearing.

The current mayor, Randriangalisa, elected in December 2019, professed his commitment to turning things around. “We will be standing up as long as we can to conserve the little left. We will keep silent only when our voice is heard,” Randriangalisa said.

By contrast, the people of Andrebakely Avaratra have been “stricter” than their neighbors about protecting the marshes, José Ramaninjatovo, the commune’s mayor, told Mongabay. “As meadow, they are the zebus’ larder,” he said, referring to Malagasy cattle. “They supply us with fishes. They protect the rice fields from alluvial deposits from the hills.”

The previous mayor of Andrebakely Avaratra showed strong leadership and the population appreciated the importance of the marshes, according to Ralainasolo.

The current mayor, Ramaninjatovo, said he intends to carry on that commitment. He said 19 people were caught destroying the marshes in mid-February, and the environment ministry’s local offices made them replant the areas with reeds and sign a letter promising never to harm the marsh. “We will never allow such a violation to happen again,” he said.

Thanks to Andrebakely Avaratra’s enduring marsh, the commune has become one of the main suppliers of dried reed to Imerimandroso, where women use it to weave baskets, hats, bags and other crafts for income.

Everyone seems to comply with the rules in Andrebakely Avaratra. Two fishermen sailing back from the open lake on an afternoon in late October each had a pile of locally made basketry fish traps called vovos. “We have removed them from the water to the village as the water is now closed,” one of them told Mongabay, referring to the lake’s annual fishing closure. It had started the day before and would last eight weeks to allow the fish to reproduce. “We take our fishing tools into water again when the water reopens.”

That kind of compliance with protective rules is typical in Andrebakely Avaratra, regardless of whether people belong to the community association or not, according to a marsh police agent named Gabriel Ralijaona in the commune’s main village. “We are very strict with the protection of the 658 hectares [1,626 acres] of marshes inside our common land,” he said. “An array of endemic birds, countless animal species including four specimens of bandro — three adults and one baby — live there. We never let anyone disturb these places.”

The bandro is the emblematic species of Lake Alaotra. With a population of less than 3,000, down from the first estimate of between 7,000 and 11,000 in 1990, the lemurs are among the world’s most endangered primates. The adults in Andrebakely Avaratra were former pets reintroduced into the wild in 2015. Andrebakely Avaratra’s marsh was chosen to host them because it was in good shape after the community had nursed it back from being “totally broken down” in the 1990s, according to Ralainasolo of DWCT. Of the five animals released in the area, two disappeared and were thought to have been hunted. But one female appeared with a newborn soon after.

Businesses behind the destruction

Around the lake, however, Ralainasolo pointed out that the bandro’s unmistakable population decline closely tracks the loss of marsh habitat. And most of the time, he said, businesses are behind the clearing. His team estimates it costs an average of 1 million ariary ($254) to clear one hectare of marsh. If so, the average destruction of around 850 hectares annually would theoretically require around 850 million ariary, or $216,000.

That kind of money, even to clear a single hectare, is out of reach for most residents. Instead, powerbrokers and banks finance the marsh’s destruction, paying poor locals to do the clearing, according to local public servants who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Mayor Randriangalisa of Imerimandroso said he had experienced pressure tactics. “After a TV station broadcast my criticism of the marsh destruction, high-placed people and one bank officer called me and asked me to stop questioning their business,” he said.

It’s a similar story when it comes to fishing. According to an anonymous source at the regional fishing department, local businesses fund the fabrication of nets up to a kilometer long that cost 6 million to 8 million ariary (up to $2,033). Businesses deploy around 30 of these killing machines in Lake Alaotra, plus another 50 smaller ones. “They are illegal and their use not only endangers stock availability in the future but also harms aquatic species,” the source said.

Over the years, marsh restoration projects on the banks of the lake, like the one the environment minister attended in February, have been successful. Experts say that if the reeds are left to regrow in peace they can recover in a few years’ time. But against the backdrop of pervasive lawlessness, the outlook for Lake Alaotra’s marshes remains uncertain.

Like many other people weary of the impunity, Randriangalisa calls for exemplary sanctions for the marshes’ destroyers. Meanwhile, the environment ministry is implementing a zero-tolerance policy against any illegal environmental destruction across the country.

According to sources interviewed for this story, eight powerbrokers residing in the area’s main city of Ambatondrazaka are suspected of funding illegal activities imperiling the wetland, including marsh clearance and fishing with large mosquito bed nets. They were summoned to appear in court in December, but the court date was postponed and a new one has yet to be made public. The outcome of the case could be a bellwether for Lake Alaotra’s future.

Clarification 4/8/21: The story has been updated to clarify that the forum that DWCT and Alaotra Rano Soa established, comprising commune-level federations and village-level community associations, manages the Lake Alaotra Ramsar Site, and not just the lake itself.

61,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Pick your doomsday: 9 end-of-the-world theories that will haunt your dreams - Salon,https://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/pick_your_doomsday_9_end_of_the_world_theories_that_will_haunt_your_dreams/,"Stephen Hawking once noted that Earth is a ""fragile planet,"" and if humanity does not find an alternative place to live -- somewhere in space -- we could be doomed. It is less of a rapture prediction than a reminder that resources are finite, there are greater forces than ourselves in the universe, and that we as a civilization trend on the self-destructive side of things.

Just this week specific studies about climate change, solar flares and the dinosaurs have been published. The common thread? Past, nearly missed, or future earthly destruction. Each one holds a lesson about Earth's fragility.

The following list is not intended as a scare-tactic lecture, but rather a look at how both we and the universe could shape humanity -- and its potential end.

1) Climate change

A new study published by Nature Climate Change has concluded that due to pollution, a shift to resource-intensive Western diets, and anthropogenic climate change, the Earth will need 50 percent more food by 2050 to feed the population. The problem? Our supply may not be able to meet the demand. As CBS explains, ""as our need for food rises, our ability to produce that food may be lowered by climate and air quality changes.""

The researchers found that global warming could reduce food production by 10 percent. Crop yields won't just be affected by global warming but also by the ozone layer. MIT associate professor and the study's author, Colette Heald, told CBS that crop production is ""very sensitive to ozone pollution."" Using a model that examined four major crops and air-quality projections, the researchers found that malnutrition in developing countries could rise to 27 percent, up from the current 18 percent.

Climate change could, of course, have other dire effects on our food production, including flooding and other extreme weather, like the current drought in California. ""Overall, climate change could make it more difficult to grow crops, raise animals and catch fish in the same ways and same places as we have done in the past,"" the EPA explains. ""The effects of climate change also need to be considered along with other evolving factors that affect agricultural production, such as changes in farming practices and technology.""

Climate change might not fully eradicate humanity, but crunch the numbers and the seriousness of the threat comes into view: Take a massive food shortage and combine that with unpredictable and violent weather patterns, mix in some geopolitical conflict (read: the possibility of all-out war) and you have an all-too-real recipe for global disaster of unprecedented proportions.

2) Pandemic

The most catastrophic pandemic on record was 1918's Spanish influenza. The virus, which at the time could only travel by ship or land, still killed 50 million people. Since then the global population has been hit with a series of contagions that have spread faster than ever before. The most recent was the H1N1 swine flu outbreak of 2009, and while it wasn't the pandemic to end all pandemics that some predicted, it was a wake-up call nonetheless.

Just this year, MERS has killed hundreds in Saudi Arabia, and Ebola has infected thousands across Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and killed more than 600, including top Ebola doctors.

How and why do diseases, particularly viruses, spread? The Guardian reported last year:

Viruses and other pathogens continually flow between species, often with no effects, sometimes mutating, once in a while causing illness. This mixing is known as 'viral chatter' and the more different species come into regular close contact, the higher the chances of a spillover event occurring. 'This is how viruses have always worked, the big change is us,' says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. 'The big change happened probably several thousands of years ago when we became a crowd species and that gave these viruses new opportunities which they hadn't had before in humans. Ever since then, from time to time a new virus has come along to take advantage of this new, very densely populated, crowded species – humans – that it can now spread between much more easily. That process is still happening; the viruses are still discovering us. We like to think we discover viruses, but it's also the viruses discovering us.""

3) Nuclear war

The days of Cold War-era ""mutually assured destruction"" might be long gone, but nuclear weapons still pose a grave threat to civilization. In 2012 the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and Physicians for Social Responsibility, who won a Nobel Peace Prize, released a study stating that famine caused by nuclear disaster could kill more than 1 billion people. The group subsequently updated this study a year later, because it underestimated the damage it would unleash on China.

""A billion people dead in the developing world is obviously a catastrophe unparalleled in human history,"" Ira Helfand, the report's author, told the Telegraph. ""But then if you add to that the possibility of another 1.3 billion people in China being at risk, we are entering something that is clearly the end of civilization.""

The above study focused mainly on nuclear war between Pakistan and India, where conflict, tension and nuclear weapons abound. However, Helfand tells the Telegraph that the result could be similar in any nuclear conflict. For example, nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia, he says, ""we are talking about the possible -- not certain, but possible -- extinction of the human race.""

The study found that particles kicked into the atmosphere from the weapons would reduce China's output of rice (10 percent over six years) and wheat (50 percent in the first year), and the U.S. output of corn and soybeans (10 percent in the first decade).

4) Solar flares

It was recently revealed that in 2012, humanity may have had a close brush with doom, all due to solar flares. On July 23, 2012, the sun belched one of the most massive plasma clouds ever detected with a speed of 3,000 km per second, according to the Guardian. That is four times as fast as a typical solar flare. The flare could have caused a massive blackout of satellite communications, power grids and electronic devices. And if the solar storm had occurred a week earlier it would have.

""If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,"" University of Colorado's Daniel Baker told the Guardian. Baker is part of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. ""I have come away from our recent studies more convinced than ever that Earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did,"" he continued. ""If the eruption had occurred only one week earlier, Earth would have been in the line of fire.""

5) The ""Deep Impact"" scenario

According to the American Museum of Natural History, there are around 1 million ""near-Earth"" asteroids that could do serious damage to the planet if they hit. (Just ask the dinosaurs.) Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the threat and deflection of such a space rock below:

You can read about the threat of space debris in depth at NASA's Asteroid Watch.

6) The robots take over

At first glance the words ""robot apocalypse"" seem far more rooted in sci-fi than reality. However, as technology lurches forward, and artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated -- to the point of actually becoming self-aware and surpassing humans in terms of raw intelligence -- who knows what could happen.

The robot apocalypse might not look like a scene from ""Terminator,"" according to experts interviewed for a recent Business Insider. But they did caution that artificial intelligence was possible, and that we ought to have a plan in place for when it does. As Northwestern University professor John O. McGinnis stated:

Even a non-anthropomorphic human intelligence still could pose threats to mankind, but they are probably manageable threats. The greatest problem is that such artificial intelligence may be indifferent to human welfare. Thus, for instance, unless otherwise programmed, it could solve problems in ways that could lead to harm against humans. But indifference, rather than innate malevolence, is much more easily cured. Artificial intelligence can be programmed to weigh human values in its decision making. The key will be to assure such programming.

7) The ""false vacuum"" theory

Now we're really getting into wacky territory. Imagine a chunk of space that is totally empty, hence a vacuum. There are absolutely no particles, no matter, nothing at all occupying this particular piece of extraterrestrial real estate. You might reasonably assume that it is therefore at what physicists call a ""ground state"" (because there is no energy to disturb it) and that this space is totally stable as a result.

Well, according to one interpretation of quantum theory, this vacuum isn't at a ground state at all. It just seems like it is. Therefore, it is a ""false vacuum."" And the fear is that someday we might find that out the hard way -- with grave repercussions for our universe.

As the website Ask a Mathematician explains:

The “danger” of living in a false vacuum is that, under the proper circumstances the false vacuum can drop into the true vacuum ... If the difference in energy between the false vacuum and true vacuum is large enough, then the surrounding space can likewise be tipped into the lower state. In theory, a “false vacuum collapse” would expand at light speed (or about light speed) from the originating event, and destroy the heck out of everything in the affected, and ever-expanding, region.

Or, to put it another way, imagine you're living inside a bubble (like, a really big bubble) that seems like it's basically in a stable, ground state -- except the air pressure on the outside of the bubble (which you can't see or detect; the bubble is all that you know) is actually much lower than the air pressure within. If the bubble were to pop, you'd quickly find that the new physical conditions you now experience are dramatically different from the ones you had enjoyed within the bubble. Apply that same idea to our universe, and imagine how much it would change if something as fundamental as energy now acted completely different. Life, the universe and everything might just suddenly cease to be.

(It bears mentioning, as Ask a Mathematician does, that ""the idea of a false vacuum is wild speculation and that there is no indication, not even a little, that the vacuum of the universe is a false vacuum and not the true ground state."")

8) The ""gray goo"" theory

This theory is so supremely loopy -- it involves tiny, malevolent robots that assimilate everything in their path -- that we might as well just refer you to the loopy video embedded below:

9) The laws of physics play out exactly as planned

The fact of the matter is this: Someday our sun will burn out and take the Earth with it, effectively ending life as we now know it. Even if we've managed to keep ourselves alive long enough to achieve interstellar travel, and find a new home in the safety of some other solar system, that hypothetical star will also eventually burn out -- as will every other star in our universe.

If prevailing theories are correct, then the cosmos has in store for them a long, protracted demise -- known as ""the heat death of the universe"" -- in which the natural, overwhelming tendency of energy and matter toward greater entropy (i.e., disorder) proceeds to the point where even the atoms that make up matter will eventually break down into basically nothing.

TOKYO - Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda, a fiscal hawk, will become Japan's sixth prime minister in five years after winning a ruling party vote on Monday, an outcome likely to please investors worried about a bulging public debt.

Noda, 54, who defeated Trade Minister Banri Kaieda in a run-off vote, must cope with a resurgent yen that threatens exports, forge a new energy policy while ending the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl, and find funds to rebuild from the March 11 tsunami at a time when huge public debt has already triggered a credit downgrade.

Financial markets, political commentators and the Japanese public are sceptical whether the new leader will have the vision, determination and time to tackle those challenges.

Bond markets are expected to welcome the choice of Noda, who among the candidates has been the only one consistently calling for Japan to face painful reforms to rein in the country's ballooning debt.

Government bond futures nudged higher after Noda made it into the second round of voting although the Topix share index erased its gains after he won the final vote.

""Let's do the utmost to tackle what we have promised and if there's not enough money, we might ask the people to share the burden,"" Noda said before the vote, in a reference to future tax hikes.

Like Kan, the new leader -- to be formally voted in by parliament on Tuesday -- faces a divided legislature and internal party rifts, raising concerns that he will join a gallery of short-lived prime ministers.

No Japanese prime minister has lasted much more than a year since 2006 and most market players polled by Reuters this month thought the next government head would be no exception.

REVOLVING DOOR LEADERS

In a rare moment of levity ahead of the vote, the jowly Noda compared himself to a ""dojo"" loach fish -- an eel-like denizen of the deep.

""I do look like this and if I become prime minister, the support rate would not rise, so I would not call a snap election. A loach has its own abilities even though it cannot do as a goldfish does.""

The results were announced by a party official after paper ballots were fed into a counting machine.

Noda has said Japan should not build new nuclear reactors, effectively phasing out nuclear power over 40 years, although he wants to restart off-line reactors after safety checks to avoid a power crunch. Japan relied on nuclear power for about 30 percent of its electricity before the Fukushima crisis.

Sceptics worry whether Noda will last any longer than his five predecessors, each of whom left office after about a year.

Moody's Investors Service cut Japan's sovereign credit rating last week citing a buildup of public debt and a lack of leadership and a long-term strategy to cope with its fiscal challenges.

Instead of a deep debate over how to end Japan's decades of stagnation and revitalize the world's third-biggest economy, the leadership race had turned into a battle between allies and critics of Ichiro Ozawa, a 69-year-old political mastermind who heads the party's biggest group even as he faces trial on charges of misreporting political donations.

Defeated candidate Kaieda was backed by Ozawa, while Noda was supported by his critics.

One of the new leader's first challenges will be seeking opposition help in parliament, where the opposition controls the upper house and can block legislation. Noda has floated the idea of a ""grand coalition"" with opposition rivals -- although the two biggest opposition groups have been cool.",2011-08-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['public', 'wins', 'party', 'japans', 'vote', 'opposition', 'noda', 'japanese', 'japan', 'prime', 'nuclear', 'minister']",China,news article,English

Over 3 million people including an estimated 1.6 million children are affected by the impact of drought across the country. The number of food insecure population is likely to increase to over 6 million people during the lean season

While some people are returning to their areas of origin, new arrivals continue to settle in the IDP camps. With the onset of winter season, temperatures continued to drop. With reports of an increasing number of patients with acute respiratory tract infections and two winterrelated deaths, winterization activities continue to be prioritized. UNICEF has delivered clothes and blankets to over 10,000 droughtaffected children in IDP settlements.

Water, sanitation and hygiene activities continue to be a priority. With partners, UNICEF is providing over 146,500 (95 per cent of target) people with safe drinking water. UNICEF installed culturally-sensitive latrines benefitting over 60,000 people (75 per cent of target) across IDP sites in Herat and Badghis.

Malnutrition rates remain high amongst displaced children. Of the 19,300 children screened in Herat and Badghis IDP settlements, 1,379 were found to be severe acute malnutrition (SAM) cases and were referred for treatment at facilities in Herat and Badghis provinces.

UNICEF and partners recently conducted measles campaign reaching over 61,510 children to prevent outbreaks among IDP children.

The drought response is 60% funded with the generous contribution of several donors. UNICEF urgently require US$4 million the needs of a quarter million people. UNICEF was forced to suspend some development activities to focus on life saving interventions.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The drought situation remains dynamic with fluctuating numbers of displaced people as some return while some new IDPs arrive in the temporary settlements. The number of people facing emergency levels of food insecurity has increased by over 74 per cent to reach 3.3 million people compared to last year. According to FEWSNET, the total food insecure population is expected to increase as high as between 6 and 7 million due to a combination of droughts effects, conflict, and weak labour opportunities and remittances from outside the country.

The worst affected provinces include Badghis, Daykundi and Badhakshan which will continue under IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) until mid-next year. Apart from fuelling large scale displacements, drought impacts have compounded the already vulnerable and impoverished communities forcing them to engage in negative coping mechanisms such asset disposal, “selling” of girl children1 or forced marriages, and withdrawal of children from school. There are reports of continued prevalence of child marriage, child labour and child engagement in all IDP settlements in Herat and Badghis.

According to the recent verification exercise, a total of 223,000 people have been displaced due to drought, of which 148,000 are based in Herat, 70,000 in Badghis and 5,000 in Ghor province2 . While the displacement trends remained stable in Herat during the month of November, the number of displaced people increased significantly in Badghis due to the worsening food insecurity. In addition, 301,000 people have been displaced due to the conflict this year with 11,000 people being forced to flee their homes over the past weeks. In addition, some 4,700 IDP families have expressed an interest in returning to their areas of origin. They have been provided with non-food items (NFIs) through IOM, and are awaiting a food distribution before the Government facilitates their return home – UNICEF will continue to support them in areas of origin as needed through durable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities, and access to mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNTs). Most IDPs however, have confirmed that they will remain in IDP sites at least through the winter.

Displaced families living in temporary and poorly insulated shelters face not only the risk of harsh winters but also the risk of flash floods, especially those residing on dry-river beds. Most recently a number of families in these high risk areas have relocated to higher ground. In addition, the risk of acute respiratory infection is very high during the winter season particularly among children due to indoor pollution as families burn wood to keep themselves warm. With 68 per cent of the internally displaced populations living in Herat reporting not intending to return to their areas of origin there is need for the government and humanitarian actors to develop durable solution beyond the current humanitarian response Due to lack of adequate food and access to other basic needs, the nutritional status of IDP children and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) continue to deteriorate. Recent assessment conducted by the Nutrition Cluster indicate that 25 per cent of children aged 0-59 months are acutely malnourished. It is estimated that over 50,000 children under five and about 20,500 pregnant and lactating women (PLWs) are currently displaced in Herat and Badghis as a result of drought. Timely and scaled up emergency nutrition response is required to avoid malnutrition related morbidity and mortality among this at-risk population.

Furthermore, on a weekly basis, during the month of October an average of 1,800 displaced children were diagnosed with diarrhoeal diseases in Herat and Badghis IDP sites. As of November, these numbers remain stable and agencies are promoting increased sanitation and hygiene behaviours. In early November, increased cases of bloody diarrhoea, reaching outbreak levels, were recorded, particularly in Badghis. However, by midNovember, these cases declined significantly. Similarly, despite the presence of outbreaks of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Herat province, there were no reported cases among displaced people.",2018-12-07 08:00:00+00:00,"['situation', 'western', 'displaced', 'food', 'badghis', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'report', 'response', 'region', 'humanitarian', 'unicef', 'idp', 'children', 'herat']",Afghanistan,news article,English

Description of the disaster

Afghanistan’s climate can be characterized by hot and dry summers and cold winters. Most of the annual precipitation takes place in the northern region in the form of snow. Afghanistan is highly prone to intense and recurring natural hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, snow avalanches, landslides and droughts due to its geographical location and years of environmental degradation. Climate change is also posing a threat to the country’s people and ecosystems. Climate change predictions such as changing temperature and precipitation pattern might lead to extreme weather event such as drought and flash floods. Changing weather is also affecting the productivity of agriculture, of which most Afghans depend on for their livelihoods, causing food security problem. Most areas in Afghanistan have experienced between four to six consecutive seasons of far below average rainfall over the last three years. This has resulted in significant reductions in snow depths, river flows, water level in dams, water tables, and soil moistures. In July 2018, the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) reported that 22 out of 34 provinces of Afghanistan, its cumulative rain and snowfall during October 2017 to May 2018 was 30 to 60 per cent below average. These conditions have already negatively and irreversibly impacted the agricultural season in Afghanistan. In addition, due to four decades of war and lack of planned development and adequate management of natural resources, deforestation enhances the impact of dry spells and drought. Repeated cycles of drought and verging on pre-famine conditions in many areas have increased vulnerabilities, resulted in the loss of crops, livelihoods and livestock, and weakened purchasing power.

According to the data presented by OCHA on 13 September 2018, the drought affected IDPs were estimated at 266,000. 84,000 of them are settled in Herat, and 182,000 within Badghis, their province of origin. In October 2018, more than 84,000 people have been displaced to Herat city and 18,579 families (94,945 people) have been displaced to Qala-eNaw City (capital of Badghis province). IDPs are residing in dozens of sites on the outskirts of the cities, or in makeshift shelters within the main cities. This makes it more difficult to reach them in a smaller number of catchment areas.

Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for millions of Afghans in the northwestern provinces. Ninety-five per cent of the population there rely on agriculture, livestock and crops to survive. People have been left without enough food to feed their families. The upcoming severe winter months will likely deteriorate their situation. Temperature in these areas has already dropped close to zero degrees at night, the coming weeks will really be testing for the drought affected families with freezing conditions, potentially resulting into winter related sickness and potential deaths. On 16 October 2018 the United Nations’ Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) have released funds to support people affected by a severe drought.

The overall response in drought-affected communities has been hampered by the access restrictions caused by security concerns. Humanitarian actors, including the Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement, have had very limited access in the past three months. For instance, Ghazni City was attacked by an armed opposition group (AOG) which took control of the locality straddling the highways. An ensuing fight resulted in displacement and deaths, including of civilians. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has reported that there were 210 civilian casualties during the month of August 2018. In addition, the RCRC Movement encountered access limitations following a declaration by an AOG in mid-August that security guarantees given to RCRC operation in Afghanistan would be withdrawn. This resulted in restricted personnel movement and reduced operational capacity pending dialogue to address concerns of the AOG. After weeks of dialogue, security guaranties to the RCRC Movement were restored on 14 October 2018. These developments have now set the pace for RCRC Movement partners to gradually resume activities, including to roll out interventions in support of communities affected by food insecurity. In this context, DREF was requested by the NS to support drought affected population in Herat and Badghis and IFRC country office launched a DREF.. Beyond that DREF support, a scaled-up response, utilizing other established resource mobilization channels, were envisioned.

Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) reports in Ocober 2018, alarmed that in the absence of adequate humanitarian assistance for drought affected communities the severity of drought is likely to be one step worst in most part of the country in coming months. Resulting in the further expansion of crises situation in north, northwest, central and south-central provinces and that started the emergency phase in northwestern provinces of the country. People in these areas were expected to face more challenges to meet their consumption requirements until the next year spring harvest. The onset of severe winter also created a large food deficit for the worst affected households, and the drought affected population is critical need of food and livelihood assistance during this lean season. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and contributed to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. Poor household dependent on rainfed wheat production, particularly in northern, northeastern, and northwestern areas, expected to experience difficulty meeting consumption requirements until next year’s spring harvest. The worst-affected households were likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter.

Households started preparing for the winter wheat planting season in October 2018. The area planted for winter wheat was anticipated to be higher than last year due to the increased likelihood of El Niño. Due to the forecasted El Niño, there was an increased likelihood of average to above-average precipitation during the 2018/19 wet season however, there remains a large spread of possible precipitation outcomes for the season.

FEWSNET projected food assistance outlook for the lean season Dec 2018 - April 2019 (issued on 30 Sep) says “Belowaverage precipitation in most areas and drought in northern parts of the country has negatively impacted wheat production, livestock body conditions, and labor opportunities. Large areas of the country are anticipated to experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in February at the peak of the lean season. In the worst-off drought-affected areas,

Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are anticipated”.

Summary of response

Overview of Host National Society

The Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) remain vigilant and have been monitoring the situation since the start of dry spell. ARCS is in close coordination with Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC). Observing the gravity of the situation in September and October 2018, ARCS headquarter requested all 34 provincial branches to submit primary information reports regarding drought situation in their respective provinces. ARCS Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated to coordinate with relevant stakeholders and update on the situation on regular basis. ARCS started coordination meetings with in country movement partners, since May 2018.

Based on the primary information reports from the branches ARCS developed its draft response plan and conducted an access mapping in the affected provinces. The access mapping was shared with movement partners as well for their comments and input. ARCS is also coordinating with clusters and national disaster management authorities. ARCS has developed a very initial response plan for drought 2018 and is committed to provide humanitarian assistance in the areas where unmet emergency needs have been identified by the Inter Cluster Coordination Team (ICCT) and ARCS provincial branches. ARCS drought response plan is to meet the immediate needs of 105,000 drought affected people (15,000 families) in the areas of food, nutrition, livelihood, health, WASH and emergency shelter. Tentative timeline for ARCS drought response is one year starting from August 2018 to July 2019.

ARCS drought response plan is flexible to adapt the changing needs and access situation, two major contributors to update ARCS response plans are; continuous need assessment: needs and unmet needs are changing on ground due to evolving nature of drought and changes in available resources with humanitarian actors. Continuous Access monitoring: On ground access is frequently changing due to unpredictable security situation in the country and ongoing fight between Armed Opposition Groups (AOGs) and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).",2019-06-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['situation', 'food', 'access', 'mdraf004', 'affected', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'final', 'report', 'response', 'arcs', 'dref', 'n', 'operation', 'areas']",Afghanistan,news article,English

FAO also notes that adverse weather conditions are exacerbating the threat of famine in Somalia. Refugees from civil strife in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Central African Republic are putting additional pressure on local food supplies in host communities.

It also points out that some 5.5 million people are estimated to be severely food insecure in South Sudan, where maize and sorghum prices are now four times higher than in April 2016. In Somalia, about 3.2 million people need food and agricultural emergency assistance, while in Yemen the figure is as high as 17 million.

In northern Nigeria, disruption caused by conflict has left 7.1 million people facing acute food insecurity in the affected areas, with even more deemed to be in less dire but still “stressed” conditions, according to the report.

According to FAO, 37 countries require external assistance for food, namely Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zimbabwe.

Southern Africa rebounds, East Africa is parched

While worldwide cereal output is near record levels, production outcomes are mixed across the globe.

According to the report, South America is expected to post strong increases, led by Brazil and Argentina.

Regional production in Southern Africa is expected to jump by almost 45 per cent compared to 2016 when crops were affected by El Niño, with record maize harvests forecast in South Africa and Zambia. This should help to reduce food insecurity in countries, such as Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.

After two consecutive years of bumper crops, the report notes that the overall food supply situation in the Sahel region is satisfactory.

However, at the start of the 2017 season, East Africa has suffered insufficient rainfall, armyworm infestations and local conflicts, leaving in the sub-region a record 26.5 million people in need humanitarian assistance.

The report warns that the situation could be aggravated further as the lean season peaks, saying, “An estimated 7.8 million people are food insecure in Ethiopia, where drought has dented crop and pasture output in southern regions.”

Moreover, cereal domestic prices reached exceptionally high levels in May, with the local cost of maize jumping by as much as 65 per cent this year in parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

The report also notes that a severe drought in Sri Lanka, followed by heavy rains and local flooding in late May, will likely reduce the country's paddy production by nearly a third, compared to the average.",2017-06-09 07:00:00+00:00,"['east', 'million', 'agency', 'local', 'sudan', 'report', 'republic', 'deepen', 'drought', 'food', 'conflict', 'somalia', 'south', 'yemen', 'middle', 'africa', 'insecurity']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

205,Drought Sri Lanka,"Relative impacts of mitigation, temperature, and precipitation on 21st-century megadrought risk in the American Southwest - Science Advances",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/10/e1600873,"Abstract Megadroughts are comparable in severity to the worst droughts of the 20th century but are of much longer duration. A megadrought in the American Southwest would impose unprecedented stress on the limited water resources of the area, making it critical to evaluate future risks not only under different climate change mitigation scenarios but also for different aspects of regional hydroclimate. We find that changes in the mean hydroclimate state, rather than its variability, determine megadrought risk in the American Southwest. Estimates of megadrought probabilities based on precipitation alone tend to underestimate risk. Furthermore, business-as-usual emissions of greenhouse gases will drive regional warming and drying, regardless of large precipitation uncertainties. We find that regional temperature increases alone push megadrought risk above 70, 90, or 99% by the end of the century, even if precipitation increases moderately, does not change, or decreases, respectively. Although each possibility is supported by some climate model simulations, the latter is the most common outcome for the American Southwest in Coupled Model Intercomparison 5 generation models. An aggressive reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions cuts megadrought risks nearly in half.

INTRODUCTION Megadroughts are periods of aridity as severe as the worst multiyear droughts of the 20th century and persist for decades. These droughts are known to have occurred in the American Southwest (1, 2) and other parts of the world (3, 4) during the past millennium, and they have been linked to the demise of several preindustrial civilizations (3, 5, 6). A megadrought occurring again in the Southwest in the coming decades would impose unprecedented stresses on water resources of the region, and recent studies have shown that they are far more likely to occur this century because of climate change compared to past centuries (7, 8). Estimating the probability of a megadrought under different climate change scenarios is critical for effectively evaluating risk and managing water resources, but recent studies have disagreed on the relative odds of these events. For example, on the basis of precipitation projections and paleoclimate data, Ault et al. (8) argued that the risk of multidecadal megadrought in the American Southwest would increase at least twofold from 5 to 15% over the last millennium to between 20 and 50% this century; Cook et al. (7) estimated those risks to be much higher in an analysis of a wider range of soil moisture indicators of varying levels of complexity. Further complicating this picture is that certain regions (for example, much of the American West) are expected to become drier, on average, even with a predicted increase in precipitation because of the increased demand for moisture by the atmosphere and consequent increases in evapotranspiration (9, 10). It is therefore critical to clarify the relative contributions of precipitation and temperature to future megadrought risk. Here, we focus on characterizing megadrought risk as a function of variables that govern the balance of moisture at the land surface during climate change. At decadal and longer time scales, these variables are primarily precipitation, which supplies moisture, and temperature and vegetation, which modulate evapotranspiration (9, 11). Although climate change projections of higher temperatures are robust and broadly consistent across different model simulations, projections of precipitation change are subject to considerably more uncertainty. Moreover, megadroughts are extreme events that unfold over decades, implying that even state-of-the-art multimodel ensembles used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have only a handful of realizations of these intervals at best. This small sample size inherently makes estimating the probability of a megadrought challenging because any empirical probability density function (PDF) of its occurrence will be finite and incomplete. For example, imagine two simulations run with a model that predicts overall drying: In the first realization, there is a megadrought, and in the second, there is none. The model-predicted probability would appear to be 50% regardless of the true megadrought PDF. As an alternative, we characterize the megadrought PDF by asking the following: (i) What are the changes in regional hydroclimate that elevate (or lower) megadrought risk? (ii) How do state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) simulate the variables that govern megadrought risk? We adopt a probabilistic framework for quantifying the risk of future events under a broad range of possible climate outcomes and then compare GCMs against these possibilities. Although there are a number of objective methods for identifying periods of megadrought in a hydroclimate time series (12–16), here we define a megadrought as a multidecadal (35-year) period of aridity as bad as, if not worse than, the worst droughts of the 20th century (−0.5 of an SD on average; Materials and Methods). By megadrought “risk,” we refer to the probability of an event occurring this century, acknowledging that the statistics of regional hydroclimate in the future will likely be different from past statistics. This notion of risk accommodates the possibility that an event might not unfold even if megadroughts are generally more likely to occur (for example, a few fortuitous wet years in a drier climate with higher megadrought risk could prevent an event from fully unfolding). Quantifying megadrought risk over a wide range of plausible climate change outcomes allows us to assess how deterministic GCMs, forced with rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, simulate changes in temperature and precipitation associated with different levels of risk (see Materials and Methods). We apply this framework to characterize the chances of a megadrought defined by precipitation and multiple soil moisture metrics in output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble (17), as well as a single-model [Community Earth System Model (CESM)] “large” ensemble (18). Although structural uncertainty and internal variability are conflated in the CMIP5 ensemble, diagnosis of a single-model ensemble allows us to delineate the role of internal variability alone in shaping future megadrought risk.

RESULTS We express megadrought risk as a two-dimensional (2D) PDF of both changes in mean hydroclimate state (denoted Δμ, Materials and Methods) and changes in hydroclimate variability (δσ) relative to the historical period (1951–2000). This framework reveals that risks are dominated by changes in the mean state of a given hydroclimate variable (Δμ), although there are some exceptions, as seen in the shading of Fig. 1 and fig. S1. For example, decreases in the mean (Δμ < 0) can be compensated by decreases in variance (δσ > 1), maintaining low megadrought risk in the light-colored triangle-shaped region of negative Δμ (between the dark shading and the dashed line on all panels of Fig. 1). Likewise, increases in hydroclimate mean values (Δμ > 0) do not necessarily correspond to lower megadrought risk if those changes are accompanied by increases in variance (dark gray shading to the right of the dashed line on all panels in Fig. 1). Herein, we will adopt the language of the IPCC to characterize probabilities (19): The black region of the 2D PDF in Fig. 1 identifies areas where megadroughts are “virtually certain” (>99% probability of occurrence), whereas the white region shows combinations of mean state and variability changes that would make these events “exceptionally unlikely” (<1% probability). Note that the regions shaded in black depict probabilities in excess of 99.9% and hence would correspond to a climate that is drier, on average, than the worst droughts of the past 1000 years (7). For reference, megadroughts in the preindustrial era only occurred once or twice per millennium on average (2, 8, 20); thus, without climate change, these events would be “very unlikely” (0 to 10% probability) (8). Fig. 1 Megadrought risk estimates for the American Southwest shown with model-projected changes in mean hydroclimate. (A to C) Megadrought risk estimates for the American Southwest (shading) shown with model-projected changes in mean hydroclimate under the RCP 8.5 (high emissions) scenario for (A) annual precipitation and JJA soil moisture (PDSI, 30-cm soil moisture, and 2-m soil moisture) in the CESM LENS, (B) annual precipitation from all CMIP5 models, and (C) JJA soil moisture indicators derived from a 17-model subset of CMIP5 for which all variables needed to compute these quantities were available (7). In all panels, the interquartile range of the ensemble is shown (the full range is shown in the Supplementary Materials). Model-based variables are normalized to unit variance over a historical reference period (1951–2000) and compared with midcentury changes (2051–2080). The shading shows the 2D PDF of megadrought risk for combinations of changes in the mean (Δμ) and variability (δσ) of a normalized drought indicator time series [z′(t)]. Although some studies have relied on precipitation alone to identify prolonged drought or megadrought conditions (13, 21, 22), our results show that this approach tends to underestimate risk in a changing climate (Fig. 1). On each panel, changes in normalized drought indicators [annually averaged precipitation, June-July-August (JJA) soil moisture at 2 m and 30 cm, and JJA Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)] are overlaid on the 2D PDF of megadrought risk, expressed again as a function of δσ and Δμ. We focus on JJA for soil moisture and PDSI because it is the driest, hottest part of the year in much of the Southwest and also for compatibility with paleoclimate reconstructions of JJA aridity (7, 12). By midcentury (2051–2080), under a business-as-usual emissions scenario, the “large ensemble” (LENS) from one model (CESM) simulates increases in annual precipitation, which decreases megadrought risk according to estimates solely based on this variable (Fig. 1A, blue circles). The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble shows a similar pattern, although (on average) regional annual precipitation decreases, slightly increasing megadrought risk (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless, models within the CMIP5 archive also support decreases in average normalized annual precipitation of nearly one full SD and increases of more than 1 SD (Fig. 1B and fig. S1). These projected changes encompass megadrought probabilities that range from virtually certain (>99.9%) to exceptionally unlikely (<0.1%) if precipitation alone is used to assess its risk. In contrast to precipitation, indicators of JJA soil moisture depict a more consistent picture of drying (Δμ < 0) and correspondingly higher megadrought risks (orange symbols in Fig. 1, A and C). Most simulations in both the CESM and CMIP5 ensembles plot into a region of the megadrought risk PDF where events are virtually certain (>99.9% probability) by midcentury (Fig. 1C and figs. S1 and S2). Note that Cook et al. (7) estimated regional risks to be closer to 80% because that study derived risks from the CMIP5 ensemble itself (which includes models that simulate both low and high risks), whereas here we are plotting where each ensemble member falls in the 2D megadrought PDF. The contrasting estimates of risk between precipitation and soil moisture hint at the role that temperature might play in elevating megadrought probabilities by altering the mean regional moisture balance during climate change. They further imply that this tendency is generally independent of the particular soil moisture metric targeted for analysis, as also shown in earlier studies (7, 23). Not all variables from all models plot into the portion of the 2D PDF shown here (fig. S2). For example, one model (CanESM2) simulates average 2-m soil moisture conditions (Δμ) that are approximately 3σ wetter by midcentury than over the historical period (1951–2000). We therefore cannot completely rule out the possibility that moisture will increase in deeper soil layers despite warming temperatures (22), but this possibility is inconsistent with near-surface conditions in most of the models, some of which support mean conditions far worse than the worst years of drought during the historical period. Moreover, variables from four models (MIROC-ESM-CHEM 2-m soil moisture, MIROC-ESM 2-m soil moisture, NorESM1-M 30-cm soil moisture, and GFDL-CM3 2-m soil moisture) fall to levels below −3σ (much drier), three of which are associated with the deep soil layer. Nonetheless, these uncertainties motivate a closer look at the relative contributions of mean temperature and precipitation change to regional megadrought risk. Because changes in the mean state largely determine megadrought risk (Fig. 1), the second 2D PDF that we consider (Fig. 2) is generated using the JJA PDSI calculated from resampled and rescaled observational and reanalysis data over a wide range of plausible changes in mean precipitation and temperature (Materials and Methods). These values are “plausible” in the sense that they are supported by the range of estimates derived from the CMIP5 ensemble (Materials and Methods). This PDF shows a strong risk dependence on both variables, with decreasing precipitation and/or increasing temperature linked to a higher probability of megadrought (Fig. 2). At a constant temperature relative to the 1951–2000 baseline (ΔT = 0), reductions in precipitation are associated with increases in risk. Likewise, increases in temperature elevate risk if precipitation is held constant (for example, ΔP = 0%). This effect is stronger for higher regional temperature change, such that even without any reduction in precipitation, the probability of megadrought is close to 100% if Southwest temperatures rise by 5°C or more, a possibility encompassed by the CMIP5 multimodel distribution under business-as-usual forcing (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the general characteristics of this 2D PDF, including its strong dependence on temperature, are robust even if temperature and precipitation only change during certain seasonal windows (fig. S3). Fig. 2 Megadrought risk expressed as a function of both mean precipitation and temperature for the American Southwest compared with projected changes in temperature and precipitation. (A) Megadrought risk expressed as a function of both mean precipitation and temperature for the American Southwest (shading) compared with projected changes in temperature and precipitation (symbols) for two scenarios: RCP 2.6 (low emissions, blue triangles) and RCP 8.5 (high emissions, red circles). CMIP5 estimates of change are expressed as the difference between the historical reference period (1951–2000) and the midcentury average (2051–2080). The megadrought risk surface (shading) is the average of all 2D PDFs calculated at each grid point in the Southwest for each combination of temperature and precipitation change. JJA PDSI is used as the reference normalized drought indicator time series [z′(t)]. The vertical dashed line marks no change in precipitation. (B) Marginal distribution of precipitation change in CMIP5 models, binned at 5% intervals from −30 to +30% of historical climatology. (C) Marginal distribution of temperature changes, binned at 0.5°C intervals from zero to six. Model-based projections of mean Southwest temperature and precipitation change are plotted as symbols in Fig. 2A (model IDs are provided in fig. S1). Because megadrought risk largely depends on these mean changes, we evaluate the effect of climate mitigation on megadrought risk. We consider the two experiments that bracket a large number of possible mitigation outcomes from the “low-emission” Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP 2.6) (blue triangles) to the “high-emission” RCP 8.5 (orange circles) scenarios. Marginal distributions of mean precipitation and temperature change from the CMIP5 archive are also shown in Fig. 2 (B and C, respectively). There is clearly more ambiguity about the direction and magnitude of precipitation change in the Southwest as compared to temperature: The distribution of RCP 2.6 precipitation is nearly unchanged from the historical period (median precipitation change of +0.7%), whereas the RCP 8.5 scenario is only moderately drier (median of −3%), albeit with greater spread (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to precipitation, the temperature distributions are universally of the same sign (positive), but the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios are distinct from one another (Fig. 2C). It is clear that the combined projections of ΔT and ΔP from the two scenarios do not overlap appreciably because RCP 8.5 projects a higher regional temperature change than RCP 2.6. These warmer temperatures shift the entire RCP 8.5 distribution into a region of the 2D PDF where megadrought risks are much higher. Even in the case where one model (CanESM2; fig. S2) predicts a 30% increase in precipitation, this amount is insufficient to overcome the effects of higher temperature—the projection still plots into a region of elevated megadrought risk (30 to 40%) despite the precipitation increase. On the other hand, some RCP 2.6 simulations project a net increase of precipitation (blue triangles to the lower right of the gray shading in Fig. 2A), and these simulations map onto a region of megadrought risk that is either similar to (5 to 10%) or lower than (<1%) the preindustrial period (8). This reduction in risk occurs largely because increases in precipitation are accompanied by only modest temperature shifts that stay below 2°C. In Figs. 3 and 4, we further highlight the role that temperature plays in “loading the dice” to make megadroughts more probable through its effect on the moisture balance of the region. In Fig. 3, megadrought risks estimated for fixed values of mean precipitation change are shown with the median temperature increases simulated by RCP 2.6 (1.9°C) and RCP 8.5 (4.5°C) over the period 2051–2100 compared to 1951–2000. Here, we focus on the second half of the 21st century to emphasize the outcomes of mitigation on mean regional temperature. Two features of Fig. 3 are important to note. First, unless mean precipitation increases, megadroughts are likely (>66% probability) to occur for a regional temperature change above 2°C (dashed line). Second, median regional warming simulated for RCP 8.5 (4.5°C; dotted line) would make megadroughts very likely (>90% probability) by the end of the century if average precipitation does not increase. This risk remains above 50% unless precipitation increases by 10 to 20%, which is not typical of models in the CMIP5 archive. These estimates of risk would be even higher, and the required increases in precipitation would be even greater, if regional warming exceeds 4.5°C, which itself is a possibility supported by many of the individual model simulations (Fig. 2C). Fig. 3 Megadrought risk estimates for fixed mean precipitation changes, shown as a function of mean annual temperature and compared with CMIP5 projections of mean warming from 2051 to 2100 compared to 1951 to 2000. Contours show risks for constant levels of mean precipitation change (ΔP), derived from the 2D PDF in Fig. 2. The dashed lines denote the median warming (again comparing 2051–2100 to 1951–2000) from RCP 2.6 (1.9°C) and RCP 8.5 (4.5°C) and their corresponding risks assuming no change in precipitation (ΔP = 0%). Fig. 4 Maps of megadrought risk for the American Southwest under different levels of warming, and the required increase in precipitation to compensate for that warming. (A to C) Maps of megadrought risk for the entire American Southwest domain at constant (historical) precipitation climatology (ΔP = 0%) and various levels of warming. These estimates are based on the Monte Carlo procedure of observational and reanalysis data, not on CMIP5 (see Materials and Methods). (D to F) Increases in precipitation (blue shading) needed to maintain megadrought risks below 50% for different levels of regional warming. Contours map the projected changes in precipitation derived from the multimodel CMIP5 mean and are shown for reference at each level of temperature change. Whereas the estimates above are based on the average 2D PDFs of megadrought risk for the entire American Southwest, our approach allows us to make similar estimates for each grid point in the domain (Fig. 4, A to C). These estimates are not based on CMIP5 output but instead are derived from probabilistic modeling of megadrought risk as a function of rescaled historical temperature and precipitation climatologies. Our results clarify the effects of these two variables on PDSI throughout the region. For temperature change below 1° and no change in precipitation, most of the domain is exposed to levels of risk below 20% (yellow regions in Fig. 4, A to C). As temperatures reach 2°C and above, increasing fractions of the domain see megadrought risks above 90%, with nearly the entire domain doing so at 6°C of warming. For each warming threshold in Fig. 4 (A to C), we have also calculated the amount by which precipitation would need to increase to keep megadrought risks below 50% (Fig. 4, D to F, blue shading). For levels of warming below 2°C, most of the region would only need modest (<10%) increases in precipitation to keep megadrought risk levels under this threshold. As warming reaches 4°C, increases of 10 to 30% are needed throughout Nevada and the four-corner region, and at 6°C, these required increases reach 40 to 50%. For reference, the changes in precipitation projected by the RCP 8.5 CMIP5 multimodel ensemble mean at each level of warming (for example, 2°, 4°, and 6°C) are shown in contours on Fig. 4 (D to F). These projected precipitation changes are negative (dashed contours) for much of the domain, with the CMIP5 ensemble average predicting a 5 to 15% reduction in precipitation in the southernmost areas considered here for levels of warming between 2° and 6°C. Furthermore, projected precipitation change is close to zero, on average, in regions where a 40 to 50% increase is needed to keep risks below 50% by the end of the century when warming levels approach 6°C.

DISCUSSION Our findings have important implications for both mitigation and adaptation. With regard to mitigation, the dependence of megadrought risk on mean temperature highlights a relative advantage of keeping GHG emissions low. In a business-as-usual world (RCP 8.5), rising temperatures alone are sufficient to drive megadrought risks to unprecedented levels. On the other hand, if regional warming remains below 2°C, megadrought risks will correspondingly remain below 66% for a wide range of precipitation changes [for example, below the IPCC-defined threshold for likely (19)]. Further emission reductions, and hence smaller temperature increases, would have even greater benefits in reducing megadrought risks, thus highlighting the fact that global efforts aimed at mitigating climate change through GHG emission reductions will also help minimize prolonged drought probabilities (24). Our results also provide insight into how much additional moisture supply is needed in the Southwest on average to keep megadrought levels below certain thresholds. In our case, we again focus on the 50% threshold, though, in principle, this could be lowered. We find that even for this fairly high tolerance of risk, most of the region would need to see at least a 40 to 50% increase in precipitation (Fig. 4, D to F, shading), which, according to the CMIP5 projections, is unlikely for the area (Fig. 4, D to F, contours) (8, 25). A constellation of adaptation policies, such as demand reduction and increased efficiency strategies, interbasin water transfers, shifts to groundwater reliance, increased surface irrigation, and other management measures, could serve to offset some of this increased moisture requirement. However, the feasibility, sustainability, and implementation of these measures and the extent to which they could reduce megadrought risk remain critical open questions. Both structural differences between GCMs and natural variability introduce uncertainty into projected changes in precipitation (Fig. 1). These uncertainties in precipitation play out in terms of both the mean state and the variability of the Southwest, although most models simulate drying in general (Fig. 1B) (8, 25, 26). Our analysis of a LENS of one model (CESM) suggests that the role of natural variability in generating precipitation uncertainty is relatively small compared to structural differences between models, which simulate regional responses to warming between −1 and more than 1 full SD. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, higher temperatures shift the moisture balance toward conditions that are drier on average, as evidenced by multiple soil moisture metrics (Fig. 1C) (7). This shift consequently makes megadrought conditions much more likely than they are today, even if precipitation increases. Consideration of soil moisture therefore reduces the uncertainty in megadrought risk estimates stemming from natural variability and model differences because it integrates the effects of moisture supply, storage, and atmospheric demand under higher temperatures. Several features of our approach make it easily extensible to other drought indicators, other parts of the world, and other global climate model data sets. For example, land surface model (LSM) components of GCMs could be forced with similar ranges of temperature and precipitation change to generate LSM-based 2D PDFs of risk, as we have done for PDSI. This would facilitate sensitivity tests of LSM components under a wide range of future possible climates, akin to “stress tests” in engineering (27), and could even be extended to include the relative impacts of CO 2 “fertilization” on megadrought risk (11). Additionally, the 2D PDFs developed here are particularly useful in the context of IPCC climate model assessments because a new generation of simulations is released for analysis every few years. Although the details of regional hydroclimate in these simulations might change, the PDFs we generate as a function of mean state and variability (Fig. 1), or temperature and precipitation (Fig. 2), will not change, because they are generated from the observed climatology. Further work could also extend risk estimates to other aspects of hydroclimate beyond soil moisture (for example, reservoir levels, snowpack, and streamflow) and other parts of the world. Finally, the dependence of megadrought risk on temperature makes the probability of these events in the future very distinct from such intervals in the past. Historically, megadroughts were extremely rare phenomena occurring only once or twice per millennium, possibly from internal variability (28) or weak external forcing (29). According to our analysis of modeled responses to increased GHGs, these events could become commonplace if climate change goes unabated. This appears to arise not because of any particular change in the dynamic circulation of the atmosphere but because the projected increase in atmospheric demand for moisture from the land surface will shift the baseline of soil moisture balance, making megadroughts far more likely than they have been for at least the last millennium (7).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Drought indicators, including precipitation, surface (30-cm) soil moisture, full column–integrated soil moisture (2 m), and the PDSI, were obtained or calculated from the following sources: (1) Output from a recent LENS experiment (18) conducted using a single model (CESM) to address the relative importance of internal climate variability as opposed to its combination with structural differences between models. Annual precipitation, JJA 30-cm soil moisture, JJA 2-m soil moisture, and JJA PDSI were either obtained or computed from the “historical” (1920–2005) and RCP 8.5 (2005–2080) experiments in the LENS data set. (2) GCM data from two RCPs included in the CMIP5 archive: RCP 2.6, which assumes aggressive cuts in emissions for the coming decades, generally preventing global mean temperatures from exceeding 2°C of total warming (17, 30); and RCP 8.5, which assumes that anthropogenic emissions of GHGs will continue to increase and contribute 8.5 W/m2 of average net radiative forcing by the year 2100. As in the study by Cook et al. (7), we computed PDSI from a 17-model subset of the CMIP5 archive for which all fields were available to calculate the Penman-Monteith estimates of evapotranspiration, and for which soil moisture fields were also available. Annual precipitation averages were used as the normalized drought indicators in Fig. 1, whereas JJA averages of soil moisture (30 cm and 2 m) and PDSI were used from the 17-model subset for consistency with earlier studies (7, 12) and to focus on the hottest, driest part of the year in the Southwest. In contrast to the earlier study (7), we also included the remaining GCMs in our analysis of risk arising from changes in precipitation and temperature (Fig. 2), although PDSI and soil moisture were not always available from these products. In this case, annual temperature and precipitation were used. (3) Observational temperature and precipitation fields, used in the Monte Carlo procedure described below, originated from the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit’s “TS2.1” data product (31). These fields are produced at 0.5° native resolution but were linearly interpolated to 1° for the megadrought risk estimates computed here. Net radiation, relative humidity, and surface pressure fields used for calculating PDSI with the Penman-Monteith method for estimating evapotranspiration are from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data (32). Climatological values of these fields were all averaged for the Southwest domain (125°W to 105°W; 32°N to 41°N) and used to compute both historical and future estimates of JJA PDSI with bootstrap resampling procedures described below. The use of climatological values for all fields other than temperature and precipitation was motivated by the goal of isolating the effects of temperature and precipitation alone on future JJA PDSI values; changes in megadrought risk were therefore constrained to arise solely from changes in either of these two variables. Precipitation and soil moisture are physical quantities, whereas the PDSI is a normalized index of aridity (though its local SD is not necessarily unity). Negative and positive PDSI values correspond to drought or wet conditions, respectively (33, 34). PDSI can be computed “offline” from model output and presents an internally consistent measure of drought across space, through time, and among models with different land surface schemes. There are a number of plausible objective methods for identifying periods of megadrought in hydroclimate time series (12–16), but we adopted a simple and relatively transparent definition recently used by Cook et al. (7) and Ault et al. (8). Namely, for a given time series (y t ), we are interested in finding intervals when the running mean (of length w) falls below a certain threshold (q). This definition has recently been shown to reliably identify decadal droughts in the historical record (with w = 11 and q = −0.5) and multidecadal megadroughts in the paleoclimate record (with w = 35 and q = −0.5) (8). These definitions were also applied to characterize 21st-century prolonged drought risk arising primarily from climate change (7, 8). We adopt the latter definition to assess multidecadal (35-year) megadrought risk in the projections. Identifying megadroughts across a wide range of hydroclimatic time series that might include precipitation, soil moisture, drought indices, and paleoclimate records required us to normalize data in ways that would allow objective comparisons across results. We therefore considered a “modified z score” (z t ′) defined as where y t is the original variable and μ ref and σ ref are the mean and SD, respectively, of that variable over a reference time period (in our case, 1951–2000). The modified z score is then smoothed using a moving average of length w to produce a new time series [X w (t)] Fundamentally, we were interested in the probability that any element of X w (t) falls below the threshold q for different combinations of shifts in the mean values of z t ′ (Δμ) and changes in the SD (δσ = σ new /σ ref ). The parameters Δμ and δσ were interpreted as being estimates of the influence of climate change on the mean and SD of some particular drought indicator (y t ). The quantity of interest was the 2D PDF of megadrought: Pr{X w ≤ q | δσ,Δμ}, which depends on both changes in the mean (Δμ) and the SD (δσ) of the modified z score (z t ′). The 2D PDF of megadrought risk (Pr{X w ≤ q | δσ,Δμ}) was estimated using a Monte Carlo procedure as in Ault et al. (8) and Cook et al. (7) and checked analytically (see figs. S4 and S5). Because we were interested in relative changes in megadrought risk as a function of shifts in the mean and different variance ratios, we would assume that the reference time series (z t ′) has zero mean and unit variance over the reference period. This assumption is analogous to the approach used by Ault et al. (8) and Cook et al. (7), which looked at modified z scores computed from precipitation and soil moisture indicators, respectively. The difference herein is that we prescribed changes in Δμ and δσ directly, rather than computing these parameters from GCM output. We generated random (Monte Carlo) realizations ( ) from a Gaussian (temporally white) distribution of changes in Δμ mean and δσ SD to represent changes in megadrought risk as a function of these two parameters (Fig. 1). Note that using Monte Carlo realizations with built-in sources of temporal persistence elevated risks in the “gray area” (values between 0.1 and 0.8) in Fig. 1 (see fig. S6). Accordingly, the PDF shown in Fig. 1 is “conservative” in the sense that true risks for certain types of drought indicators with interannual autocorrelation might be even higher than those depicted. CMIP5-based estimates of Δμ and δσ were computed from annual precipitation, JJA soil moisture (at 30 cm and 2 m), and JJA PDSI by normalizing each of these indices over the historical period (1951–2000) and computing their normalized means and SDs at midcentury (2051–2080). These model-based estimates were then overlaid on the 2D PDF in Fig. 1. We estimated the 2D PDF of megadrought risk as a function of changes in both temperature and precipitation (Fig. 2) using PDSI as a proxy for the surface moisture balance. To do so, the following four steps were repeated 100 times for each grid point in the American Southwest. First, the joint distribution of precipitation and temperature was generated for each month from observations. Second, temperature and precipitation values were drawn from this distribution (with replacement) to generate 100 “bootstrap” years (1200 months). Third, changes in temperature (ΔT) were then added to each month of these realizations, and precipitation was likewise scaled between −30 and +30% of climatology [that is, the range encompassed by the GCMs; see the studies by Cook et al. (7), Ault et al. (8), and Diffenbaugh and Giorgi (25)]. Fourth, these bootstrap realizations were used to compute PDSI for each unique combination of change in precipitation and change in temperature. Climatological values were used for all other variables (surface pressure, net radiation, and humidity) required by the Penman-Monteith model of evapotranspiration. As in the study by Cook et al. (7), the 1931–1990 period was used for calibrating the PDSI, and JJA average values were used to identify megadroughts. The process above generated bootstrap realizations of PDSI with different combinations of change in temperature (ΔT) and precipitation imposed on the historical period. We estimated a 2D PDF of megadrought risk for JJA PDSI at each grid point by normalizing each realization by the mean and SD of the 1951–2000 period, applying a 35-year averaging window, and identifying periods where this running mean dropped below −0.5σ. This step yielded one 2D PDF per grid point. PDFs from all grid points were averaged together for the American Southwest to produce a “master” PDF of megadrought risk, against which changes in temperature and precipitation from the entire CMIP5 multimodel ensemble were compared [for example, even from members that did not have sufficient data for computing the soil moisture quantities or PDSI in the study by Cook et al. (7)]. This 2D PDF is shown in Fig. 2. Last, in Fig. 2, CMIP5-based estimates of changes in temperature and precipitation were computed as the difference (ΔT), or ratio (%), between midcentury (2051–2080) and historical (1951–2000) periods. These differences were calculated independently from each run; thus, the symbols in Fig. 2 represent internally consistent (with respect to each simulation) estimates (as opposed to comparisons of model simulations to historical values).

576,Drought Sri Lanka,GIEWS Country Brief: Sri Lanka 27-May-2019 - Sri Lanka - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/giews-country-brief-sri-lanka-27-may-2019,"FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT

Production of 2019 paddy crop forecast at bumper level Cereal import requirements in 2019 expected to decline for second consecutive year Prices of rice declined since beginning of 2019, while prices of wheat stable Food security conditions generally good

Production of 2019 paddy crop forecast at bumper level

Harvesting of the 2019 main “maha” paddy crop finalized at the end of March, while planting of the 2019 secondary “yala” paddy crop is ongoing and will be completed by the end of May. The “maha” output is officially estimated at 2.9 million tonnes, 22 percent above the five-year average, reflecting above-average planted area, mainly driven by remunerative prices and average yields, supported by adequate and well-distributed rainfall. Similarly, production prospects for the secondary “yala” crop, to be harvested in August and September, are favourable on expectations of average yields and an increase in the planted area compared to last year’s average level. Overall, the 2019 aggregate paddy output is preliminarily forecast at a bumper leve of 4.5 million tonnes, 18 percent above the near-average level in 2018.

Harvesting of the 2019 main “maha” maize crop finalized in March and production is estimated at about 275 000 tonnes, 25 percent above the five-year average, as the expansion in plantings more than offset the damage inflicted by the Fall Armyworm infestation in the districts of Anuradhapura, Ampara, Badulla and Monaragala. In these areas, as of 15 April, official reports indicate that about 50 percent of the area cultivated with maize was affected and crop losses were estimated at 10 percent of the initially expected output. Assuming an average output of the ongoing secondary “yala” maize crop, to be harvested between August and September 2019, the aggregate 2019 maize production is forecast at 310 000 tonnes, about 23 percent above the five-year average.

Cereal import requirements in 2019 expected to decline for second consecutive year

Cereal import requirements in the 2019 calendar year are forecast at 1.4 million tonnes, accounting for the second consecutive annual decline since 2017, when imports reached a record high due to the impact of drought on local production.

Import requirements of wheat in the 2019 calendar year, which account for the largest share of imports, are forecast at 1.2 million tonnes, virtually unchanged compared to the average level in 2018, reflecting sustained demand from the milling industry. Similarly, import requirements of maize are expected to remain at 130 000 tonnes, close to the above-average level in 2018, reflecting growing demand for food and feed use. By contrast, import requirements of rice in the 2019 calendar year are forecast at a well below-average level of 50 000 tonnes, reflecting ample domestic availabilities from the 2018 paddy output and expectations of a bumper crop in 2019.

Prices of rice declined since beginning of 2019, while prices of wheat stable

Prices of rice firmed up steadily since September 2018 until January 2019, in line with seasonal trends and declined between February and April 2019, pressured by the harvest of the main “maha” paddy crop. Overall, prices of rice in April 2019 were close to their year-earlier levels.

Prices of wheat flour remain overall stable in 2019 so far, reflecting adequate availabilities from imports. Overall, prices of wheat were slightly above their year earlier levels in April 2019.

Food security conditions generally good

The Buccaneers boss believes the standards set by the management will enable his troops to lift trophies this season

Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic believes the club’s solid leadership will pave the way to securing trophies ahead of the new 2019/20 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season.

The Serbian boss is yet to lift a trophy since taking over the coaching reigns at Mayfair two seasons ago, but he is confident his troops will finally bring a smile to their supporters.

“When I turn behind, there are things that are called trophies and there are some that are invisible and will leave a legacy even when I vacate my post from this great club,” Sredojevic said as quoted by Independent Media .

The Sea Robbers narrowly missed out on lifting the Telkom Knockout Cup title last season, where they marched to the final but lost to eventual champions Baroka FC on penalties.

“We are not thinking about anything that’s left behind, but we are fully thinking about the season that’s in front of us,” he added.

In addition, the former Uganda national team boss has been praised for reviving Pirates since taking over two seasons ago and helped the club to finish as runners-up to reigning PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns.

After winning the CBL Cup by beating rivals Kaizer Chiefs last weekend, the Soweto giants are expected to challenge for trophies whilst looking to dethrone the Brazilians as PSL title holders.

""We have a leadership that’s pushing us to reach the criteria and standards, and once we do that, trophies will come,” continued the manager.

“It is there we shall then see what football will repay us with for the sleepless nights and enormous working days.

Pirates will open their 2019/10 PSL campaign against Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday evening.",2019-08-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['troops', 'trophies', 'psl', 'pirates', 'micho', 'title', 'thats', 'thinking', 'drought', 'orlando', 'end', 'trophy', 'vows', 'sredojevic', 'boss']",Ghana,news article,English

Water levels at the reservoir are dangerously low. Cahora Bassa was only 34% full as of the end of November, according to the National Water Directorate.

Pedro Couto, head of the plant, told staff in November that a lack of rain over the last two years had “resulted in an unprecedented reduction in the Cahora Bassa reservoir,” according to the Maputo-based business publication, Zitamar News.

Data from the dam’s operator, Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), show that the dam’s water level is only 17 meters (55 feet) above the minimum operating level. If next year’s rainy season does not deliver higher rainfall, the situation could get worse. Southern Africa is experiencing its worst drought in almost four decades, reducing water flows in the Zambezi river system where three major hydro dams, including the Cahora Bassa, supply electricity to the region.

Cahora Bassa’s troubles are a sign that southern Africa, one of the continent’s regions most vulnerable to climate change, may need to rethink its reliance on hydropower. Hydropower accounts for 21% of electricity in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), a common electricity market for 12 countries. Low rainfall since 2014 has strained the SAPP, causing blackouts and electricity shortages that raise the risk of social instability, according to analysts.

Zambia, which depends almost entirely on hydroelectric power from the Zambezi river, has suffered power shortages since last year. The Kariba dam, a reservoir upstream from Cahora Bassa that supplies almost all of the electricity in Zambia and Zimbabwe, fell to 12% capacity this summer. Zambia has started investing in solar plants.

Other countries may soon feel the pinch. Cahora Bassa, which has a capacity of 2,075 megawatts, sells most of its electricity to South Africa, as well as to Zimbabwe, and Mozambique’s national utility, EDM. Already, HCB has cut supplies to South Africa’s power utility Eskom by 13%.",2016-12-14 08:00:00+00:00,"['africa', 'southern', 'bassa', 'africas', 'soon', 'run', 'cahora', 'power', 'reservoir', 'dams', 'electricity', 'hydropower', 'plant', 'biggest', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English
638,Drought Sri Lanka,Monk turns saviour for animals in drought-hit Tumakuru - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/monk-turns-saviour-for-animals/article27110594.ece,"Japananda Swami arranges water and food for them atop Hanumana Betta

In Pavagada taluk, which is reeling under severe drought, a monk has become a saviour for hundreds of peacocks, peahens, langurs, monkeys, and wild boars.

Hanumana Betta is a rocky hill 20 km from Pavagada, the perennially drought-hit taluk of Tumakuru district, and it is home to around 1,000 peacocks, 350 langurs, and various other animals.

Japananda Swami, of the Sri Ramakrishna Sevashram in Pavagada, came to know that some peacocks were dying owing to the lack of water. He went to the hill and found the carcasses of a few peacocks, and a wild boar.

Japananda Swami said that he was pained by the deaths and added that many langurs and peacocks from the hill migrated to other areas. “Some of them would frequently come to agricultural fields and destroy the crops. This had become a huge problem for the farmers of K. Rampura, which lies at the bottom of Hanumana Betta,” he said.

Moved by the plight of the animals, the monk decided to provide water and foodgrains to the animals on Hanumana Betta.

With the help of the Infosys Foundation, he has been able to supply water through tankers and pipes to the waterbodies atop the hill. Foodgrains are also provided to the animals every alternate day with the help of the villagers of K. Rampura.

Village children also help the monk and his men fill saucer bowls, constructed by the Forest Department, and stone ponds, which were cleaned and rebuilt, on top of the hill. The monk has also purchased a diesel motor to pump water from a borewell to the ponds, nearly 100ft high, on the hill.

A class 3 student of K. Rampura, Rahul, said: “I like to go to the hill, along with friends, to feed the peacocks. We will also collect the peacock feathers fallen on the ground and keep them in our books”.

K. Akkalappa, farmer, said that nearly 20 villagers carry 30 kg of soaked bengal gram, 15 kg of jowar, and 10 kg of peas to feed the birds.

He said: “I do it punctually as it helps me save my crops from birds which used to come and destroy them due to lack of food and water on the hill”.

The monk said that he would continue to provide water and foodgrains to the birds and the animals until the taluk gets rains.

He added that those animals, which had migrated to the villages and towns, have returned back to the hill.",2019-05-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['saviour', 'peacocks', 'tumakuru', 'pavagada', 'langurs', 'droughthit', 'water', 'taluk', 'kg', 'turns', 'animals', 'hill', 'monk', 'swami']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
825,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: 77962 NSS Personnel Deployed ... to Various Sectors - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160438.html,"About 77,962 National Service Personnel have been deployed across the country in all sectors for the 2019/2020 service year.

Out of the number, 66,348, representing 85.1 per cent of the total postings have been deployed to the public sector while the private sector received 11,614 personnel representing 14.9 per cent of the total figure.

Consequently, a total of 6,000 were deployed to support the Agricultural sector including the Planting for Food and Job (PFJ) Policy.

At a press briefing to announce the postings in Accra yesterday, the Executive Director of the National Service Scheme (NSS), Mr Mustapha Ussif said 2,000 personnel were also posted to support NSS's newly introduced poultry entrepreneurship programme which focused on all the value chain in poultry production.

Postings registrations, he said, would commence at all regional centres across the country from Monday, July 22 to Friday, August 20.

He mentioned that the period was provided to ensure service personnel had sufficient time to go through the registration processes before formally beginning their service on September 2.

According to Mr Ussif, all service personnel were required to provide their student's identification cards (ID) and any valid national ID card to avoid impersonation or ""attempts by unscrupulous persons to compromise the process"".

The Executive Director, however, noted that the personnel were required to book an appointment on the scheme's website before reporting to the premises of the designated registration centres to register, adding that personnel who showed up at the registration centres without appointment letters would be turned away.

He revealed that the trend in the regional distribution with regard to requests, choice of regions and deployments had not seen much change as compared to previous years.

""The Greater Accra, Northern and Ashanti regions received very high posting requests while the two upper regions, Upper East and Upper West recorded low requests but we are working to shore up the numbers in these two regions with late registrations and postings in due course,"" he added.

Mr Ussif advised the service personnel to stay away from people who might approach them to offer assistance to change their postings, saying such persons should be reported to any officer of the scheme or the law enforcement agencies for the necessary action to be taken against them.

Started in 1973, the National Service programme is a compulsory one-year service required of all citizens of Ghana who are 18 years and above, at the time of deployment to, among other objectives, encourage the spirit of national service among all segments of Ghanaian society.

Under the scheme a person who has not commenced and completed his period of national service would not obtain employment outside the scheme or be employed by any other person outside the Scheme.",2019-07-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['national', 'various', 'deployed', 'service', 'personnel', '77962', 'scheme', 'ussif', 'sector', 'regions', 'upper', 'total', 'postings', 'sectors', 'ghana', 'nss']",Ghana,news article,English

216,Drought Sri Lanka,Colombo guilty of 40% water waste - Ceylon Daily News,http://www.dailynews.lk/2017/01/20/local/105257/colombo-guilty-40-water-waste,"Close to 30 percent of water supplied to households in the country is wasted with Colombo guilty of wasting almost 40 percent of the water supplied, City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary Nimal Hettiarachchi said yesterday.

Old plumbing, together with inefficient and wasteful use of water by the people were blamed for the staggering numbers. The world average for water waste stood at 18-20 percent. Hettiarachchi who is one of the three Secretaries appointed to the Presidential Task Force to tackle issues regarding the drought appealed to the public to use water more efficiently given the stresses placed on the supply during the drought. “We will do our best to ensure there is no water shortage.

At present, the situation is not dire but we are trying our best to prepare for the worst.

If the drought continues, we will have to pay more attention to protecting our water sources.

We ask the people therefore not to pollute the water, as this tends to happen more during the drought”, said Hettiarachchi as he addressed a media briefing together with the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary and the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary.

The Water Board which presently operates 75 bowsers is expected to purchase an additional 25 to supply water to all areas.

In addition, they plan to build 480 temporary water tanks in drought stricken areas to offer relief to the people. “Only 47 percent of the people in the country have access to pipe borne water. The rest rely on private sources such as wells but during drought,wells dry up, so we will have to supply more people with water,” Hettiarachchi said.

Ensuring a continuous supply of drinking water, according to the Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Udaya Seneviratne has become the greatest challenge of the Presidential Task Force, “The water levels in the Mahaweli reservoirs are at less than 50 percent.

Only 45 percent of our total agricultural lands have been planted (35 percent of paddy and 10 percent others).

The main priority thus is to direct water for drinking, then to protect the crops that have been planted and then the remainder will be given for power supply,” Seneviratne said.

Seneviratne also pointed out that the current drought made it a necessity for climate mitigation actions to be put in place,

“Sri Lanka has signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 and thus we prepared a plan of action in 15 identified areas, along with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all areas”, explained the Mahaweli Secretary and added,

“This drought can be used as a good opportunity to introduce new water management systems, agricultural methods and technology that would use our resources wisely”.",2017-01-20 08:00:00+00:00,"['task', 'guilty', 'supply', 'ministry', 'supplied', 'water', '40', 'colombo', 'drought', 'hettiarachchi', 'waste', 'areas', 'mahaweli', 'secretary']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

In 2018, UNICEF reached nearly half the world’s children with vaccines; provided 13.3 million bed nets and nearly 50,000 tonnes of ready-to-use food

COPENHAGEN / NEW YORK, 24 July 2019 - In 2018, UNICEF procured US$3.486 billion worth of goods and services to help children in 150 countries live better lives.

Vaccines, clothes, medicines, education kits and school books are some of the goods and services that helped children fight disease, learn, and grow -- especially in countries affected by emergencies and conflicts.

In 2018, UNICEF helped children by:

Procuring 2.36 billion doses of vaccines to fight a variety of diseases including measles, diphtheria, tetanus and HPV, and reach nearly half the world’s children

Providing children access to safe water with 1.26 billion water purification tablets and chlorination/flocculation sachets

Protecting children from mosquito-borne diseases using 13.3 million bed nets

Treating children suffering from malnutrition with 47,760 tonnes of ready-to-use therapeutic food

Helping children get back in the classroom with 4.5 million schoolbags and 84,000 education kits

“Every child is unique and so are their needs,” said Etleva Kadilli, Director of UNICEF’s Supply Division in Copenhagen. “Procuring supplies for children is not as simple as buying products off the shelf. It requires close collaboration with diverse partners to ensure children in different countries and areas get what they need to live, improve their lives, and be safe and healthy.”

As situations in countries become more complex, especially during emergencies, the ability to adapt and do things differently can help to maximize impact for children and their families.

In East Asia and Pacific, the September 2018 earthquake and tsunami off Sulawesi island affected more than 375,000 children in and around Palu city. UNICEF supported the Government-led response by using small aircraft to bring supplies as close as possible to those in need. The Government then delivered them to the affected area. A strong in-country supply chain and Government pre-positioning quickly reduced the need for UNICEF support.

Together with a global network of stakeholders, UNICEF is developing new products and approaches to meet the needs of the hardest-to-reach. This isn’t limited to product innovation alone, but also includes working with partners, especially businesses, to influence markets and make products for children more accessible, affordable, safe and sustainable.

For example:

To help children recover from malnutrition, UNICEF procured a record 65 per cent of ready-to-use therapeutic food from manufacturers located in or close to countries with the greatest need. This not only supported local economies but also made transportation more efficient and reduced the carbon footprint.

In the Syrian Arab Republic, despite the conflict, UNICEF is working with local businesses that continue to operate to provide hygiene and education kits, as well as warm clothes – helping UNICEF deliver supplies to children quickly.

In Nigeria, UNICEF convened a landmark Regional Sanitation Industry Consultation to encourage cross-border collaboration with Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire and identify ways to improve the availability of affordable toilets and sanitation services for families.

“The support of governments, businesses, donors and our partners on the ground has been invaluable in allowing us to reach millions of children as quickly as possible”, added Kadilli. “Yet the needs remain immense. Sustainable, long-term funding must continue to be a priority for us to meet the needs of children in increasingly complex situations.”

Conflict and insecurity continue to be a primary driver of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes in Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Yemen and in greater Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile states of Sudan. Most recently, conflict in Tigray region of Ethiopia is causing high levels of population displacement, disrupting livelihood activities and market functioning, and limiting food assistance. In Yemen, intensified conflict in Marib is of increasing concern and a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists. South Sudan also continues to experience one of the worst food insecurity emergencies globally and urgent food assistance is needed to save lives, especially in greater Jonglei and the greater Tonj in Warrap.

High and above-average staple food, fuel, and water prices continue to limit food access and compound the severity of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes in Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Somalia. In Sudan, millet and sorghum prices rose 600-650 percent above the five-year average in March across most markets. Similar trends are observed in South Sudan. In Ethiopia, maize prices in Addis Ababa rose to 100 percent above the five-year average and sorghum prices rose 50 percent above the five-year average in Woldia in Amhara region. In Yemen, although four fuel ships were permitted to deliver fuel to Al Hudaydah port in March, fuel shortages and upward pressure on food prices are expected to resume after 1-2 months. In central and northern Somalia, water scarcity has caused the price of a 20-liter jerrycan of water to double compared to 2020.

In bimodal areas of eastern Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, delayed and significantly below-average rainfall in March is anticipated to result in a second consecutive season of below-average harvests and suppressed livestock production. The population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse is likely to peak in these areas during the subsequent June to September dry season, as households’ access to food and income erodes amid concurrent conflict, price, and desert locust shocks. In unimodal areas of western Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan, a forecast of above-average rainfall from June to September is likely to cause a consecutive year of flood-related displacement and crop and livestock losses. The population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is also likely to peak in these areas during this period, which overlaps the local lean seasons.",2021-04-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['rises', 'ipc', 'fuel', 'food', 'price', 'message', 'phase', 'weather', 'wave', 'prices', 'crisis', 'south', 'sudan', 'shocks', 'key', 'yemen', 'update', 'ethiopia']",Somalia,news article,English
178,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka's Small Tea Farmers Turn Sustainable Land Managers - Inter Press Service,http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/03/sri-lankas-small-tea-farmers-turn-sustainable-land-managers/,"Sri Lanka’s Small Tea Farmers Turn Sustainable Land Managers

RATNAPURA, Sri Lanka, Mar 28 2017 (IPS) - As the mercury rises higher, Kamakandalagi Leelavathi delves deeper into the lush green mass of the tea bushes. The past few afternoons there have been thunderstorms. So the 55-year-old tea picker in Uda Houpe tea garden of Sri Lanka’s Hatton region is rushing to complete her day’s task before the rain comes: harvesting 22 kgs of tea leaves.

“The rain is very unpredictible. Now there are downpours but it has been very dry the past few months,” says the daily wager who owns a one-acre marginal farm.

Yet at the Uda Houpe tea garden, the situation is much better, says Daurkarlagi Taranga, Leelavathi’s daughter and fellow tea farmer. “We have not been affected as badly as others. Here, the bushes are still full (of leaves) and the ground is moist thanks to the techniques we use,” she says.

These techniques are assorted green actions taken by small tea planters to manage their farmland in an eco-friendly way, explains Alluth Wattage Saman, manager of the Uda Houpe estate. The most important of these actions is minimising use of synthetic weed killer (herbicide), widely viewed as the main reason behind the degrading health of soil and tea plants in the region.

Climate threat to a lucrative sector

The tea sector of Sri Lanka is 153 years old and remain the largest industry today, providing employment to 2.5 million people. According to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the industry counts for 62 percent of all agricultural exports and brings home 1.6 billion dollars in foreign currency each year. Contributing to this huge business is a 400,000-strong small tea farmer community.

However, the lucrative tea economy of the island nation has been witnessing growing environmental challenges – the biggest of them being severe land degradation.

According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), there is high rate of land degradation across the tea growing region in Sri Lanka. The biggest reason is that farmers here have used synthetic weed killer on the plantations for several decades.

They also paid little attention to protecting the water sources and biodiversity around the plantations. This has gradually affected the health of the soil, decreasing its fertility level, making it more acidic and also causing soil erosion.

While the degradation has affected the entire industry, the livelihoods and food security of the small tea growers are particularly threatened, says Lalith Kumar, project manager at the Tea Small Holding Development Authority (TSHDA) in Ratnapura, a region that produces over 70 percent of Sri Lanka’s tea.

Greening the Small Farms

The TSHDA is a government agency working with small tea growers in the country. According to Kumar, there are 150 small tea farms (less than 10 acres of land) in the Ratnapura region alone which provide livelihood to about 100,000 farmers. Climate change has worsened the situation with recurring droughts, erratic rainfall, and increasing soil erosion and acidification.

As a result, tea bushes are withering and moisture from the topsoil is evaporating, leaving the soil hardened and plant roots weak and damaged.

To help the tea farmers deal with this, TSHDA is currently working with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) on a project to minimise herbicide use in the small tea farms and reverse the processes of degradation by sustainably managing the land.

According to a document by Global Environment Facility (GEF), the funder of the 2.9 million project, the goal is to “improve farm management practices, so that existing production land becomes more productive and forests, rivers, streams and other biologically important land situated on or adjacent to tea production areas are protected from negative impacts.”

A major step taken by the TSHDA is to train the farmers to manage their land in a sustainable way with minimum or no herbicides.

“We have started to train small farm managers in sustainable land management techniques that are simple, yet effective,” Kumar said. A lot of weeds grow around the tea bush, but only some of them are harmful.

“We train them in identifying the weeds and removing the harmful ones either by uprooting or cutting them at the roots. The weeds are then used as a bed of mulch, applied in between the two rows of tea plants. This helps retain the moisture on the land,“ he explained.

Training the Community

Saman, the manager of the Uda Haupe, is one of the 300 small tea growers who have been trained by TSHDA so far. It was an informal, hands-on training, reveals Saman, which included a day-long visit to a progressive and sustainably managed farm – the Hapugastenne tea estate.

There Saman saw small farmers like him managing their land without any synthetic weed killer or pesticides. He also learned to use organic manure, protect the water sources like natural springs within the plantation, as well the shedy trees, so birds and other animals can also survive. Finally, he learnt that the yield of the farm had increased almost by 60 percent since they adopted those techniques.

The visit, says the tea planter, helped him realize “small steps can bring bring big changes in a farm”.

The result has been encouraging: “I earlier spent 35,000 on herbicide every year, now I am saving that amount. My overall profit has gone up to 75,000 rupees,” says Saman, who has shared the newfound knowledge with his workers.

Some Unplugged Gaps

Saman and other small tea farmers in the area like Leelavathi sell their harvest to Kahawatte Plantation, a tea estate owned by corporate tea giant Dilmah. Early this month, the plantation received a Rainforest Alliance certificcation which recognizes that the estate maintains sustainability standards all along its supply chain, including the farms from where it buys the tea. This has already boosted the price of the estate’s produce, but suppliers like Saman are not aware of either the certification or its economic benefits such as higher market value.

“Nobody has told us about this,” Saman says.

Others want the government to help them with monetary incentives to better deal with climatic challenges.

At present, TSHDA offers a 50 percent subsidy to farmers who want to do a replantation on their farm – a complex and costly process that involves complete uprooting of all the tea plants, re-preparing the soil and replanting the saplings.

This is done when the yield in the farm drops dramatically due to either age (normally 30 years) or severe degradation of the land that cripples productivity. However, there are no other subsidies or incentives provided to the farmers right now for adopting sustainable land management – a policy that small tea growers like Leelavathi would like to see change.

“Since the use of the mulch, I began to save 700 rupees every month on herbicide and my total income rose to 15,000. But because of the growing droughts, I have to use most of it on fertilizer. If the government gives a subsidy, it will be very helpful. Or else I may have to migrate to another estate to earn more,” she says.",2017-03-28 07:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'saman', 'land', 'farm', 'managers', 'small', 'sri', 'uda', 'lankas', 'sustainable', 'turn', 'tea', 'soil', 'tshda']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Napoli’s Jose Callejon is desperate to beat Barcelona when they meet them in the United States this week.

The Partenopei will have two bites at the ferry though, with the pair to face off in Florida and Michigan.

“I want to beat Barcelona,” the former Real Madrid player said.

“It’s a special game for me because of my past. It’s a friendly, but it’s very important for us.

“We’ve played well against both Liverpool and Marseille.”

Napoli have finished runners up in both of the most recent seasons in Serie A, second only to Juventus.

“We want to reach the end of the season with the chance of doing great things,” he explained.

“We want to give it our all and hope we have a great year.”

Serie A appears to be improving of late, with Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival at Juventus increasing interest around the world.

“It’s been behind other leagues for a few years,” the Spaniard said.

“But Italy is getting better.

“With the arrival of Cristiano, something is changing in Serie A.”

678,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,El Nino linked to cholera outbreaks in Africa - study - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/el-nino-linked-to-cholera-outbreaks-in-africa-study/,"Heavy rainfall linked to the El Nino weather pattern can push up cholera cases in Africa, according to a study published on Monday that could help health workers prepare for outbreaks.

El Nino is a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that occurs every few years, with global consequences. In Africa it often brings excessive rains to the east while the southern cone gets parched.

By mapping and comparing cholera outbreaks in Africa with previous occurences of El Nino, researchers at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) saw a clear link between rainfall caused by the weather pattern and the number of cholera cases.

“ Knowing there is elevated cholera risk in a particular region can help reduce the number of deaths that result. Justin Lessler, lead researcher and epidemiologist, Johns Hopkins University

For example when El Nino occurred between 2000 and 2014, which increased rainfall in east Africa, cholera cases tripled in the region, according to findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Researchers said the findings could help health workers anticipate and prepare for potential cholera outbreaks, since scientists are able to track when El Nino will occur six months to a year in advance.

“Knowing there is elevated cholera risk in a particular region can help reduce the number of deaths that result,” said Justin Lessler, lead researcher and epidemiologist at JHU.

An intestinal infection often linked to contaminated drinking water, cholera causes diarrhoea and vomiting, leaving small children especially vulnerable to death from dehydration.

Africa has the most cholera cases in the world with more than 900 recorded deaths in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.

The researchers said higher rainfall overruns sewerage systems in areas with poor infrastructure, which contaminates the drinking water and could lead to cholera.

But in drought-hit regions, some people contract cholera after drinking contaminated water since there are no other water sources, the researchers said.

“Linking these outbreaks to El Nino events and increased rainfall improves our understanding of the environmental conditions that promote cholera transmission in the region and will help predict future outbreaks,” said study author and epidemiologist Sean Moore.

Each year, there are between one to four million cholera cases recorded globally and at least 21,000 die from the preventable disease, the WHO says.

528,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Humanitarian Ministry and United Nations jointly declare drought in Somalia - statement - Horn Observer,https://hornobserver.com/articles/849/Humanitarian-Ministry-and-United-Nations-jointly-declare-drought-in-Somalia-statement,"Mogadishu, Somalia– Based on observed drought conditions and rainfall forecasts, the Federal Government of Somalia and the humanitarian community are deeply concerned about the deterioration of the dry conditions in Somalia which has now escalated to a drought situation.





More than 80 per cent of the country is experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. Although the Gu rains started in some parts of the country, forecasts indicate below-average rainfall. Limited rainfall amounts are expected in May and June with larger parts of Somaliland, Puntland, central regions and Gedo region being the worst affected.

""Somalia experiences a cyclical pattern of drought every five to six years and the failure of the rains thus far spells disaster. At a time when communities are already struggling to cope with the recent water shortages in many parts of the country, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and already dire humanitarian situation in the country, many lives are at stake,” said Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Khadija Diriye.

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. Since 1990, Somalia has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. In 2021, drought conditions are expected to increase displacement and have a lasting negative impact on livelihoods and food security outcomes. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by the end of 2021, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced.

The loss of livelihoods forces families to rely on increasingly severe coping mechanisms, worsened by political instability, armed conflict and forced displacement. ""We are at the brink of a human catastrophe amidst an already dire humanitarian situation,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator, Adam Abdelmoula. ""The cost of inaction is far too dire and the time to take action is now. Urgent and immediate collective action, including scaling-up of response and funding, is needed now to mitigate a full-scale disaster.”

The Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) requires US$ 1.09 billion to assist four million people, including more than three million people in acute need. As of today, the HRP is 15 per cent funded.

1206,FL-2016-000114-EGY,Egypt's Economy Isn't Tanking. It's Thriving. - Foreign Policy,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/26/egypts-economy-isnt-tanking-its-thriving-sisi-muslim-brotherhood-imf/,"Egypt’s Economy Isn’t Tanking. It’s Thriving.

Yehia Hamed’s article for Foreign Policy earlier this month wrongly casts a bleak outlook on Egypt’s economy. Hamed, who served as investment minister in Mohamed Morsi’s ousted government, which led Egypt between 2012 and 2013, implicitly suggests that international investors must be clueless—having poured billions of dollars into the country’s equity and fixed-income markets—and that the government is mismanaging the economy despite lowering Egypt’s international risk, as measured by credit default swaps, to almost half the risk premium as when he was removed from his position as investment minister.

The article, which includes a somewhat reasonable criticism of Egypt’s high debt levels and its rise in poverty levels after the economic reforms of 2016, goes on to paint an unrealistic and unfair view of the country’s economic challenges. It was equally surprising to me, as an Egyptian living and raising my children here, to hear that Egypt was about to collapse. Hamed theatrically warns that Egypt is overstating its income by excessive borrowing and cries wolf that the international community may soon face an imminent flood of Egyptian immigrants at the shores of Europe.

Ironically, Hamed warns readers about the rising deficit, which is now at least 300 basis points lower than when he was a minister (calculating deficit as a percentage of GDP), while blaming the current government for using strong fiscal policies to control it. Although I am not a fan of extreme fiscal tightness in a country such as Egypt, where domestic demand comprises the lion’s share of GDP, Hamed uses a questionable methodology to support his thesis.

Government intervention and interest-rate policy do not mix. There are many serious issues for which Egyptians can blame the government, but it is folly to blame the government for the temporary high interest costs, as interest rates remain the mandate of central banks everywhere, and it is particularly harsh to apportion blame to a government that has fully delivered on its fiscal targets.

Criticizing austerity measures, in a country that suffers from structural fiscal imbalances, and blaming policies instituted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the rise in poverty levels among Egyptians would have been very understandable had it come from Egypt’s left, which has genuinely stood against the measures the government has taken since 2016 to fix public finances. In fact, the IMF’s international reform programs have seen many failures, and its policies have never guaranteed success.

But it is a surprising critique coming from a member of the right-wing Muslim Brotherhood, which has long promoted itself to the West as a strong advocate of free market and investor-friendly policies. Hamed was a minister in an ousted economic cabinet that ironically enough approached the IMF in 2012 and was very close to inking a deal with its representatives in response to what was at the time a bleak economic situation: a severe foreign currency shortage, a mammoth black market, shortages in energy supplies and basic products, painful capital flight, and an investment slump that led to anemic growth, stagflation, and a rise in unemployment.

The period from 2012 to 2013 could indeed be labeled Egypt’s worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Unless Hamed can publicly claim that the IMF had proposed to the Brotherhood’s government a different program than the IMF’s classic historical combo of fiscal discipline and monetary tightness—or that his government was ready to reduce the massive twin deficits without raising tax revenues, rationalizing subsidies, and floating the currency—his article will remain nothing more than a polite attempt at political positioning that seeks to muddy the waters of the current government’s financial successes, rather than a serious analysis of Egypt’s financial and economic conditions.

Hamed’s article is a polite attempt at political positioning that seeks to muddy the waters of the current government’s financial successes, rather than offer a serious analysis of Egypt’s financial and economic conditions.Egypt’s economy is only collapsing if the definition of an economic collapse is when a country has managed to cut its current account deficit from more than 5 percent of GDP to less than 2.5 percent—from sustainable income sources (excluding grants)—and nearly halved its budget deficit from 16.5 percent in 2013 to 8.5 percent of GDP in five years, while growing by 5.5 percent (up from the anemic 2.2 percent growth in 2013), according to IMF and Ministry of Finance data. By every definition of the phrase, this is a strong economic recovery.

Egypt has indeed accumulated external debt in the past couple of years, and its public debt has increased, but this is only one side of the story. But before coming to the startling conclusion that the economy is collapsing, one must first compare the growth in debt to that of GDP, analyze the balance of payments’ fundamentals and sustainable sources of foreign currencies, and examine the cost of servicing the external debt.

The answer to these questions would take only a few minutes to obtain by comparing domestic and external debt levels to GDP in both emerging and developed markets. In fact, according to World Bank and CEIC data, Egypt’s external debt at approximately 32 percent of GDP is well below the emerging markets average of 42 percent and much more favorable than most of its emerging peers, such as Turkey (58 percent), Malaysia (63 percent), Chile (62 percent), South Africa (48 percent), Morocco (44 percent), Vietnam (43 percent), and Mexico (36 percent).

Apart from the macroeconomic ratios, the structure of Egypt’s external debt is key. Of the country’s external debt of about $100 billion, more than 60 percent of this is from international institutions (such as the IMF and World Bank) and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) allies at a subsidized cost, averaging less than half of what Egypt pays today for its Eurobonds. Egypt’s foreign debt service obligations in the next two years, which include interest and principal repayments, currently stand at $15 billion, according the Central Bank of Egypt (excluding the GCC deposits that were rolled over recently)—almost 70 percent of the net portfolio inflows that Egypt has managed to attract into its capital markets since the start of the economic reform program.

Even assuming Hamed’s extremely pessimistic scenario—that Egypt will fail to reschedule any of its outstanding foreign currency debt, will not improve its balance of payments any further, and will be unable to attract even $1 of foreign direct investment—the total external funding gap (defined as the foreign debt obligations plus the current account deficit) would still not exceed $25 billion in the next 24 months, which amounts to just 55 percent of the country’s current foreign reserves. No international investor in his or her right mind would call this a default scenario.

The economy in Egypt is by no means perfect, but the country has delivered on the financial and monetary side of its reform program, with the exception of the still very high interest rates that are a real burden. There remains a long way to go to fix the structural imbalances in the economy. The informal sector remains large enough to weigh on overall economic efficiency; capital accumulation remains below target; the domestic savings rate is very low, even after the consumption shock the economic rebalancing process has triggered, as disposable income for Egyptians has been hit by inflation and the government’s fiscal controls; and foreign investors remain challenged by global emerging-market risks, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and poor domestic institutional capacity.

Egypt’s middle- and lower-income citizens have borne the brunt of the reforms and are yet to reap the benefits in terms of more jobs, recovery in real income, and overall state services. Egyptians need to see inclusive growth strategies and a stronger safety net, despite the various initiatives and social programs the government has so far implemented. Most importantly, Egypt needs a vibrant, dynamic, and healthy private sector to lead growth and employment. Egypt’s private sector suffers from crowding out by the state, higher input costs, and, hence, a lower return on capital in its traditional industries.

Egypt still needs to unleash the potential of its private sector, which could turbocharge the country’s economic growth potential, by further supporting small businesses and investing heavily in innovation, financial inclusion, and vocational training to foster growth and sustainable development. Even so, if you compare Egypt’s economic challenges today to those of five years ago and reflect on other emerging markets’ structural economic and financial challenges, it is clear that Egypt is far more likely to boom than bust.

1555,FL-2020-000038-EGY,A River that Belongs to None: The Nile River Dispute - The Colgate Maroon-News,https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com/25209/commentary/a-river-that-belongs-to-none-the-nile-river-dispute/,"The Nile River, for all of its recent history, has been a crucial geographic feature in Africa’s landscape. The fertile lands around the Nile have provided livable and farmable land to its inhabitants. In modern times, the Nile has been a hotly contested resource. Since Egypt completed the Aswan Dam in 1970, the first modern dam of the Nile, Egyptians have depended on it for water, flood control and electricity. Several dams have been built since then, but the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), begun in 2011 and now near completion, has generated turmoil among several powerful African nations and their allies. While the GERD is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa, its situation along the Blue Nile is currently one of the most contentious political and economic situations in Africa. The question of sustainability is at the core of this current crisis.

Ethiopia and Egypt have butted heads ever since construction began; from the Egyptian point of view, the dam is a detriment to the country’s potential. Egypt claims the dam will cut off water supplies to the south; any amount of water loss is problematic, as the Nile provides Egypt 90% of its water. Since the only farmable land in Egypt lies within a couple of miles of the river, Egypt doesn’t produce enough food to feed its whole population; as a result, Egypt is an import-reliant economy. The Egyptian government doesn’t want to make their food insufficiency worse by conceding water rights to Ethiopia. However, with construction almost complete, Egypt’s focus has turned to the filling of the dam. The two countries mainly disagree over how long the new reservoir would take to fill up.

For Ethiopia, the country’s economic ambitions hinge on the completion and success of the dam. The dam will be the country’s largest-ever public works project in its history and will help solve Ethiopia’s energy shortage (60% of Ethiopians have no electricity). While Egypt has conceded that the completion of the dam is inevitable, there is still incredible tension. Negotiations have come to a halt, as Ethiopia and Egypt disagree upon the filling time. While Egypt wants Ethiopia to gradually fill up the dam over twelve years, Ethiopia hopes to fill it in six. Because of the lack of negotiating progress, the United States recently withdrew $130 million of aid to Ethiopia. A lot is at stake for both Ethiopia and Egypt. On one hand, Ethiopia is shouldering most of the cost of the dam and would like to get a return on their investment as soon as possible. On the other, the dam could exacerbate Egypt’s already significant water insecurity.

Tensions have risen so high that the Ethiopian government has banned flights over the dam for security reasons. With Ethiopia taking such strong safety precautions, it’s probable the government foresees future non-diplomatic measures being taken by Egypt if negotiations don’t progress. Ethiopia has also just announced they have achieved one year of filling, and that the dam will start generating electricity in the next twelve months.

Climate change and sustainability are at the heart of this debate. Sudan is experiencing its worst floods in recent history, crippling an emerging country that has struggled with violence, disease and political turmoil. The Nile River Delta, where 40-50 million Egyptians live, could be partially underwater soon if sea levels rise. Additionally, the area is becoming less fertile as a result of sediments caught in the Aswan Dam; another huge dam will only worsen the problem. Saltwater intrusion also is lowering farmer’s outputs already, and the problem will only get worse. The flooding every year is devastating; however, the drought that an impending climate crisis will bring will be more devastating.

The issue of Nile water availability is a microcosm of the region’s slowly manifesting confrontation with climate change. Finding agreement on the dam’s filling has been difficult because the lifeblood of several African countries depends on the outcome. Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia can find a suitable agreement for all parties on the filling of the dam, but only if each country makes concessions. With Egypt historically being in control of the Nile, it’s going to be difficult to give up the regional hegemony they’ve enjoyed over the Nile’s water. The Nile is a shared resource, and the countries it runs through must find a fair agreement to make sure it stays that way. Finding an agreement soon is crucial. Ethiopia has already filled the dam with a year’s worth of water and will fill it up as fast as possible if negotiations remain stalled. Once they find a solution, the countries can move on together to face the biggest threat to the region’s health and existence: climate change.",2020-10-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['belongs', 'egypt', 'water', 'ethiopia', 'agreement', 'soon', 'nile', 'dispute', 'countries', 'dam', 'river', 'filling']",Egypt,news article,English

Three Czech ice hockey world champions, a Swedish Olympic and world champion and a Slovak great were among the victims of a plane disaster that killed dozens north of Moscow on Wednesday, officials said.

The disaster was feared to have killed 43 people on the charter flight carrying one of Russia's top ice hockey teams, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, form Tunoshna north of Moscow for a Continental Hockey League (KHL) match in the Belarussian capital Minsk.

The three Czechs were Jan Marek, Karel Rachunek and Josef Vasicek, all stars of the national side that won the world championship six times since 1996, the Czech embassy in Moscow said.

""This is a shock; Not only were they excellent hockey players but also great friends and people,"" said Czech ice hockey association chief Tomas Kral on news website www.idnes.cz.

The Slovak foreign ministry said there was one Slovak victim, and that the only Slovak national on the passenger list was Pavol Demitra, a Slovak forward who led the national side at last year's world Championship.

Rachunek, who turned 32 in August, played for Ottawa Senators for three years starting in 1997, and later for New York Rangers and New Jersey Devils. He scored an equaliser against Sweden seven seconds from time in the 2010 world championship semi-finals which the Czechs eventually won.

Marek, 31, had become a popular forward in the KHL, playing initially for Magnitogorsk before joining Yaroslavl.

Vasicek won the Stanley Cup with Carolina Hurricanes in 2006, and scored the final goal in the Czech Republic's 3-0 win against Canada in the world championship final in 2005.

Swedish ice hockey player Stefan Liv was also among the 43 perished hockey players on Wednesday, the Swedish Embassy in Moscow confirmed to news agency TT.

The 30-year-old national team goalkeeper, an Olympic and world champion in 2006, was killed along with many of his team mates when the plane came down shortly after taking off for a flight to Belarussian capital Minsk. Two passengers survived but were in a grave condition.

""We are in mourning, and our thoughts are with those close to him and his relatives,"" Swedish Hockey Association chairman Christer Englund said in a statement on the association's website (www.svenskhockey.se).

603,Drought Sri Lanka,'There's No Fish to Catch': Global Warming Upends Traditional Livelihoods in Sri Lanka - Pacific Standard,https://psmag.com/environment/global-warming-is-changing-traditional-livelihoods-in-sri-lanka,"Two separate studies highlight Sri Lanka's increased risk to changing weather patterns that are driving extensive changes in both living standards and livelihoods.

For Nataraja Kumar, 47, a fisherman from Guru Nagar, a sleepy coastal village in Sri Lanka's north, it's no longer possible to continue with his traditional livelihood.

""I went fishing as a 10-year-old boy with my father and grandfather. But I will not train my son to be a fisherman. There's no fish to catch,"" he tells Mongabay.

Fishing is Kumar's only life skill, and he has five mouths to feed. Having failed to eke out a living in the past two years as a fisherman, Kumar is now slowly letting go of his traditional livelihood to work as a day laborer at a construction site in another town, earning around $3 a day to keep food on the table. Many other fishermen, he says, are making the same switch.

""The sea seems to have changed. We find less [fish] and fewer species,"" Kumar says, adding that the northern waters no longer yield the highly popular black tiger prawns, a top seafood export.

It's the same story for those engaged in growing traditional crops, like onion farmer Sudhiran Kanapathipillai, 51, from Jaffna, the capital of Sri Lanka's northern province.

For three consecutive seasons, his crops have failed due to unpredictable weather. ""We cannot rely on wet and dry spells any longer. They just don't happen that way,"" he tells Mongabay. ""Paddy farmers suffer more than us due to their dependence on the monsoon pattern. North was once agriculturally productive. Our soil is good but the weather has failed us.""

The island's north is feeling the heat—literally—with two separate studies highlighting Sri Lanka's increased risk to changing weather patterns that are driving extensive changes in both living standards and livelihoods.

Increasing Climate Risks

A briefing paper titled the Global Climate Risk Index 2019 published by Germanwatch looks at the impacts of weather-related loss events such as storms, floods, and heat waves from 1998 to 2017. It ranked Sri Lanka as the second most impacted territory in 2017.

In 2015, Sri Lanka ranked 98th, but made a swift jump to the second slot two years later after the island suffered extensive losses, both in terms of deaths and property damage, from a series of exceptional catastrophes.

In May of 2017, heavy landslides and floods hit Sri Lanka after strong monsoon rains in the country's southwest. More than 200 people died in the worst rains experienced on the island since 2003. The extreme weather displaced more than 600,000 people and affected 12 out of 25 districts.

The Sri Lankan experience corresponds well to the findings of the Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which predicts an increase in risks associated with extreme weather events as global mean temperatures rise, also linking global warming to El Niño events.

Smart Agriculture and Alternate Livelihoods

On the ground, communities are now being asked to deal with the reality, not as individuals but as entire communities.

S. Sivakumar, director of the department of agriculture at the Northern Provincial Council, says these are among the ""hot"" issues faced by the provincial administration.

""As weather turns extremely unpredictable and extreme weather events are causing repeated crop failure in a region that was battered by nearly three decades of war, it is a fight against poverty, which requires a new approach toward ensuring food security and livelihoods,"" he told Mongabay.

Sivakumar says that the inadequacy and unpredictability of rainfall, coupled with prolonged spells of drought, are affecting traditional livelihoods such as fishing and agriculture. ""We recommend smart agriculture and the reintroduction of ancient systems such as the water cascading system Sri Lanka was once known for,"" he said.

""Through pilot projects on ‘climate smart integrated agriculture' in the three northern districts of Jaffna, Vavuniya and Kilinochchi, we promote solutions to overcome impacts of climate change.""

But it's not that easy for a region that was once a hotbed of ethnic violence to make that journey toward normalcy while battling against weather events that pose a new challenge.

The challenge before Sri Lanka, and the island's north in particular, is well documented in a September of 2018 World Bank Group study that looked into South Asia's climate profiles, analyzing how temperatures have risen considerably and will continue to rise, with precipitation patterns becoming less predictable.

""Sri Lanka's proximity to the ocean makes it vulnerable to increase in extreme tropical storms and sea level rise,"" the study says. It says the country also contains ""hidden hotspots,"" areas that are economically at risk from climate change that are not often discussed. It adds that, by 2050, annual average temperatures on the island are projected to increase by about one to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) under a climate-sensitive scenario, and one to two degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) under a carbon-intensive scenario.

The study says Sri Lanka has 19 million people living in locations that would become ""moderate or severe hotspots"" by 2050 under the carbon-intensive scenario, or more than 90 percent of the total population.

And if the projection holds true, Sri Lanka's northern and north western provinces will emerge as the top hotspots.

The island's north, home to a large population of poor and displaced communities, will have to bear the brunt of the vagaries of the weather, adding a new challenge to its long-term recovery, the country snapshot says.

As such, Jaffna will become the top hotspot, followed by Puttlam in north western province, followed by Mannar and Kilinochchi in northern province, making the island's north highly vulnerable.

Likewise, western province is also projected to be highly impacted, with a decline in living standards of about 7.5 to 8 percent, including in Colombo, Sri Lanka's economic hub that contributes over 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

The projections call for drastic changes in traditional livelihoods and for urgent economic adaptation.

With a projected decline in living standards of 1 to 7 percent, it is suggested that non-agricultural jobs will shoot up by 30 percent, marking a huge shift from the agriculture-based rural economy and livelihood patterns.

Adaptation and Mitigation

Measures are being taken to mitigate impact caused by extreme weather events, even as adaptation holds the key, says the director of Sri Lanka's Climate Change Secretariat, R.D.S. Jayathunga.

He told Mongabay the actual problem lay with the increase in the nighttime temperature fluctuations, impacting a multitude of crops and reducing agricultural productivity, making it a main focus of the country's national policy and the adaptation plan to combat climate change impact.

Sri Lanka needs to improve its resilience through targeted programs, he said, identifying future challenges such as agriculture, heat stress, indirect health impacts, and biodiversity loss. ""We need to be ready as a resilient nation,"" Jayathunga said.

25,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Fresh Produce favourites per country - FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/2124552/fresh-produce-favourites-per-country/,"Fresh Produce favourites per country

Dutch cheese, German bratwurst and Russian vodka. Iconic cultural favourites not to be missed when visiting the country. But what about fresh produce? Although we think we do know most of the greens out there, there are still certain tasty products that are very popular elsewhere. This has much to do with the availability of the product, but also history can play an important role.



Strawberries in the United Kingdom

Whoever thinks of the summer in the UK, thinks of strawberries with whipped cream. The Wimbledon Tennis Championship in particular is strongly linked with strawberries. During the tournament, about 28,000 kilos of the fruit is consumed. The United Kingdom has for years been the largest buyers of Dutch and Belgian strawberries. Exports in recent years have significantly declined though, due to increased domestic production.



Sweetcorn in the United States

Sweet corn is one of the most important vegetables in the United States. The US cultivates the vegetables almost year-round. Annual consumption of sweet corn in the United States is about 10 kilo per person. That is much more than the 60/70 grams by European consumers. The bi-colour variant has now gained a major share in the United States.



Asparagus in Germany

Germany is fond of asparagus. Almost a third of Germans will eat asparagus at least once a week during the season. In the past year, they ate an average of about 1.1 kilos of asparagus per person. In other European countries, the vegetable is relatively unknown. German asparagus is largely domestic, grown on approximately 20,000 hectares.



Potatoes in India

India has a large potato market. The country consumes more than 40 million tons of potatoes per year, an amount that increases annually by 6 percent. More than 80 percent of the potatoes in the country is destined for the fresh market. The majority is sold in small markets and through roadside venues. The Indian potato production has grown in recent years. It is expected that the harvest in 2020 will surpass 49 million tons.



Tomatoes in Italy

Although the consumption of tomatoes has dropped slightly in recent years, the vegetable is still among the most important in Italy. Italian cuisine simply can’t do without tomatoes. In the mid-18th century, there was a real tomato culture in Italy, while the vegetables didn’t reach European tables until the 20th century. Production in the country amounts to almost one million tons, most of which is destined for domestic consumption. The Italian consumption of tomatoes per capita last year was 16 kg, while still at 21 kilos in 2011. In comparison: In Belgium, consumption is at 10.4 kilograms per capita.



Coconuts in Thailand

In Thailand, you'll come across fresh coconuts anywhere you go. On the beach there are lots of coconut trees, but there are also many plantations where coconuts are grown professionally. In Thailand, the coconuts are sold on the street. The coconut is very versatile. It’s used to make coconut oil and coconut milk, widely used in Thai cooking. Coconut oil is becoming increasingly popular, because it is a saturated fat and therefore the only vegetable oil suitable for heating because it remains stable at high temperatures.



Chicory in Belgium

Belgium is the birthplace of chicory. Consumption in the Netherlands is about three kilos per capita, though twice as high in Belgium. In Germany, for example, only 400 grams per capita is consumed. Belgium is one of the most important chicory producers in the world. In recent years, chicory acreage declined, and it is expected that cultivation will continue to drop.



Garlic in China

China is the land of garlic. The country is the largest exporter of garlic worldwide, and domestic consumption is high. On average, the Chinese eat ten cloves of garlic a day. When the Summer Olympics were held in China in 2008, an MP complained of the odour of taxis in Beijing. Taxi drivers were explicitly asked not to eat any more garlic. The unpleasant smell of garlic in the taxis is in fact a common complaint of tourists. Chinese garlic also contains less Allicine, a type of antibiotic that causes bad breath.

71,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"AM4U in Rancho Cucamonga makes clothes without water, pollution - San Gabriel Valley Tribune",https://www.sgvtribune.com/2014/08/10/am4u-in-rancho-cucamonga-makes-clothes-without-water-pollution/,"RANCHO CUCAMONGA >> Bill Grier says the apparel industry is on the cusp of returning to Los Angeles and it is all due to a process he invented called infusion.

Bombarding polyester or nylon with photons releases tunnels of energy deep within the material that draw in the dye from an ink-jet design matched to the back of the fabric. Almost like magic, the material and the design merge and the shirt is ready for the cutter and the sewing machine.

No water. No chemicals. No pollution.

Grier, 67, said he has demonstrated his active-tunnel infusion process to Chinese investors. He has made swimwear, leggings and tops for American Apparel in Los Angeles. And he’s taking orders from apparel companies who want to build his factory as an add-on to their traditional business, or as a new line of on-demand clothing shops that can increase profits while shrinking one’s environmental footprint.

During a hot day in the Inland Empire, Grier invited the press to his prototype factory located in an industrial area of Rancho Cucamonga. The drought, entering a fourth straight year in California, was a topic of conversation. Normally, it takes 80 to 200 gallons of water to dye a shirt, he said. “A shirt like this,” he points to the black golf shirt he’s wearing, “takes 200 gallons of water and 73 cancer-causing chemicals. We use no chemicals and no water. All we use is the frequency of the fiber.”

The waterless, shirt-making process, a critical component of Grier’s AM4U company, received a key endorsement from Cal Poly Pomona’s Apparel Merchandising & Management Department. Peter Kilduff, department chair, showed up along with Los Angeles County Supervisor-Elect Hilda Solis for a tour of his Rancho Cucamonga test factory in July.

By eliminating many steps, Grier says his process can increase profits by as much as 400 percent. And it’s the right time for a sea change in apparel making.

“Smaller dye houses use a million gallons a day of water and they are suffering because of the water shortage. We’ve got to move on this enabling technology,” Grier said.

Solis, who soon will represent the First District which includes East L.A, Boyle Heights and downtown Los Angeles, sees active infusion as a way to create better-paying garment-worker jobs.

Grier starts his employees at $12 an hour with full benefits, he said. The infusion process cuts down on the number of steps used to make garments. He can make a shirt or a pair of jeans in 30 minutes under one roof because he doesn’t have to send out to dye the material, then send designs for assembling to shops in Pakistan or China, then wait for the final product to be shipped back to the United States. Also, since the process makes garments on-demand, it eliminates waste inherent in the clothing business.

“They dump about 30 percent into the landfill,” he said, adding that his process could usher in a new business model for the industry.

“Our process is much more efficient. It allows us to provide high paying jobs,” he said. It only takes 24 people to run each factory, from order, design to manufacturing, assembly and shipping.”

He sees a market both in the United States and overseas.

The potential for clean, non-polluting factories in China is strong, he said. In many industrial cities, waste water laced with chemicals from apparel factories pollute the country’s rivers and drinking water supply.

“They can take all that water they save and use it for agriculture,” he added.",2014-08-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['grier', 'cucamonga', 'angeles', 'process', 'am4u', 'apparel', 'makes', 'dye', 'shirt', 'factory', 'pollution', 'chemicals', 'water', 'rancho', 'clothes', 'los']",China,news article,English
637,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought has brought Karnataka’s Bhovi well-diggers back to centrestage - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/society/drought-has-brought-karnatakas-bhovi-well-diggers-back-to-centrestage/article26406902.ece,"Until piped Cauvery water came to Bengaluru in 1972, open wells were the main source of drinking water

After 15 years, Shankar finds himself peering down a 60-ft well shaft at the dhobi ghat in Bengaluru’s Malleswaram neighbourhood. Here, a lakh or so clothes are washed every day.

The well is believed to be over 100 years old and its walls are overrun with shrubs. The water is covered with a thick green layer of the aquatic fern, azolla. Shankar and nine men of his team, all belonging to the Bhovi or Mannu Vaddar community of traditional well-diggers, will spend the entire day desilting, cleaning and reviving the giant well. “Because of the drought, the dhobi ghat has been buying water from private tankers and drawing from borewells that are fast running dry. So, the washermen’s association approached us to revive the well,” says Shankar.

He and his colleagues, Shankar recalls, had made the trip to the dhobi ghat from his village in the city’s outskirts to clean the same well 15 years ago. “We used to clean the well during the day and sleep next to it at night.”

Going down

As we watch, the well-diggers start cutting the shrubs at the mouth of the well. They then open the iron mesh that covers it and three men — Munikrishna, Srinivas and Pedanna — carefully descend into the depths with the help of thick ropes. What follows is an awe-inspiring drill of coordination, camaraderie and skill. First, the water must be pumped out. Then, bucket after bucket is lowered into the well and silt, muck and broken branches are pulled out. Then the azolla is cleared with a cane basket that acts as a sieve.

The water must now be made potable by adding alum, lime and potassium permanganate. “I learnt how to revive wells from my parents and grandparents. I was 15,” says Ramakrishna, one of the nine-member team.

Until piped Cauvery water came to the city in 1972, open wells were the main source of drinking water. Borewells came in the early 1980s, and the culture of open wells all but vanished, says S. Vishwanath, advisor, Biome Environmental Trust, which conducts research on water and sanitation.

Harvesting rainwater

Today, 40% of Bengaluru is dependent on groundwater. As per the regulations of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and the water supply and sewerage board, all new and old buildings of a given size must harvest rainwater or face penalties. So, recharge wells, that collect rainwater and pump it into the ground, are becoming popular.

For instance, Indian Institute of Management Bangalore has over 60 recharge wells. And it is the Bhovi community that is helping dig, clean and maintain all these wells across Bengaluru.

As Karnataka faces its second consecutive year of drought — the government has declared 156 of the 176 talukas or 88% of the State drought hit — the well-diggers have been brought back to the centrestage of water management.

Bhovipalya village on the outskirts of Bengaluru is where Shankar and his colleagues live. In fact, every one of the 110 families in this village is from the Bhovi community. Here I meet Laxmi Amma, Shankar’s mother. As a little girl, she tells me, she often accompanied her parents when they went to dig wells. “Traditionally, both men and women used to dig wells, but women don’t do it any more,” she says.

The history of the Bhovi or Vaddar community is not clear. Some claim Vaddars came from Odisha while others say their ancestors came from Andhra Pradesh, as their primary language is Telugu. The tradition of well-digging exists in Maharastra and Gujarat too.

Vaddars are broadly divided into three groups: Mannu Vaddars work with soil; Kallu or Dagad Vaddars work with stone; while Ooru Vaddars grow ragi.

Bhovis belong to the Scheduled Castes and often face social ostracism. Pavitra, the daughter of a well-digger in Bhovipalya, is studying B.Com in a Bengaluru college. But she says: “If my friends get to know my parents are well-diggers they will stop talking to me. In any case, no one eats lunch with me,” she says, holding back tears.

It is only education that will bring dignity to the community, believes Ramaswami, Ramakrishna’s father, who has dug more wells than he can count. “I am illiterate and remember how my parents had to beg and struggle to feed me. I educated my son, who is doing better than me. My grandchildren study in an English medium school and have a brighter future.”

Meanwhile, the well at Malleswaram’s dhobi ghat is pristine now, and the city’s clothes can be washed clean once more.

111,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Beware the Green Revolution - African Arguments,https://africanarguments.org/2015/10/beware-the-green-revolution/,"Many government and agencies see India’s 1960s Green Revolution as a great success that Africa should emulate. The soaring suicide rate amongst India’s farmers tells a different story.

The development community has been crowing of late about the obvious need to revamp African agricultural practices. Not since colonial times has it been so easy to blame small peasant farmers for the continent’s development woes. The standard agricultural development formula to address this, developed in other world regions, is to adopt new technologies and commercialise the farming sector. But African leaders ought to look twice before blindly encouraging their farmers to adopt this capital intensive approach.

The results have been nothing less than deadly in central India.

After four consecutive years of low rainfall, the Marathwada region of Maharashtra State has emerged as India’s farmer suicide capital. Located in central India, this region is about the size of Sierra Leone and has a population similar to that of Mali or Burkina Faso. Not unlike the savannah regions of West Africa, farmers in this relatively poor area used to mainly grow drought tolerant sorghum and millet, as well as other food crops. However, the Green Revolution of the 1960s – an international effort to boost crop productivity with the use of hybrid seeds, fertilisers and pesticides – encouraged farmers in this area to move away from growing a variety of food crops towards the production of cash crops, mainly cotton and soybeans.

The underlying problem driving the majority of farmer suicides in this region has been indebtedness. Farmers borrow money to put a crop in the ground and then low global prices, insect infestations, or poor rains lead to low returns. Increasingly, indebted farmers then turn to more informal sources (often village money lenders) for further loans at even higher rates. Sadly, this vicious cycle often leads to the male head of household committing suicide to avoid the humiliation of total destitution, typically leaving behind an even more impoverished wife and children.

So far this year, 660 farmers in the Marathwada region have committed suicide. This is up from 422 suicides for the same area during all of last year. Not counting this most recent year, nearly 300,000 farmers committed suicide in India between 1995 and 2014. Unlike other regions of the world where urbanites take their own lives at higher rates than rural folk, the suicide rate for farmers in India is nearly 50% higher than that of the general population. Suicides are also most concentrated amongst those farmers who grow cash crops (as opposed to those who grow food crops for their own consumption).

One bright spot is that crop failures in India rarely lead to hunger because of the state’s extensive public distribution system which guarantees access to basic food stuffs at affordable prices for the poor.

But that said, the farmer suicide situation is alarming and there is a collective clamour for the authorities to do something. The prevailing view, often expressed in the local Indian media, is that the system of chemical intensive, cash crop based agriculture is fundamentally sound and that marginal changes will make it function properly. These adjustments include more robust crop insurance, access to credit at reasonable rates, water at affordable prices, and inexpensive seed and chemical inputs.

But is the Green Revolution approach to agriculture really viable in this part of India and what can Africans learn from the current crisis?

While this year is admittedly worse than usual, with the monsoon rains only 50% of normal, many Indian farmers struggle in even the best of times. Several decades of cotton farming in Marathwada has led to soil degradation, declining crop yields and the need to use even more chemical fertilisers. Furthermore, the idea of promoting more irrigation is not really practical as many cities in the region are already forced to ration water in drier years. Funnelling more water towards agriculture would likely further deplete groundwater resources.

A green alternative?

There are new voices in India now calling for an alternative approach to agriculture. Some NGOs are working through farmer field schools to introduce new agroecological techniques. These include plant associations in diverse cropping systems to maintain soil fertility and manage pest problems, the use of earthworms to produce rich compost, the planting of less thirsty crops, and new water-harvesting techniques and conservation methods. The saving grace of this alternative approach to agriculture is that it does not rely on costly external inputs, and therefore farmers do not take on the risky debt that has been driving the suicide problem. It is also more sustainable over the long run because it is less demanding of the soil and water resources.

Given the shortcomings of the Green Revolution approach to agriculture in India’s Maharashtra state, it is not only the Indian government that must begin to rethink its approach to agriculture. We must question how Asia’s Green Revolution experience is being touted in Africa as the way forward.

Organisations such as the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the Gates Foundation, and the US Agency of International Development (USAID), argue that the first Green Revolution largely bypassed the African continent. The result, they suggest, has been a huge untapped agricultural potential and a persistent hunger problem on the African continent. Proponents of a New Green Revolution for Africa argue that the increasing use of improved seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, along with a more commercialised farming sector that involves agroprocessing, will increase farmer incomes and eliminate hunger.

But aid agencies and African authorities should carefully study the experiences of India with the first Green Revolution before uncritically adopting this approach. While it may be appropriate for the region’s wealthier farmers, this more capital intensive strategy is often too risky and environmentally problematic for poorer cultivators. They must also understand that India’s laws insuring affordable access to food have done more to combat hunger than unsustainable farming technologies.

18,DR-2014-000109-CHN,40 Million People Depend on the Colorado River. Now It's Drying Up. – Mother Jones - Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/food/2014/08/southwests-water-crunch-even-worse-we-thought/,"Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.

Science papers don’t generate much in the way of headlines, so you’ll be forgiven if you haven’t heard of one called “Groundwater Depletion During Drought Threatens Future Water Security of the Colorado River Basin,” recently published by University of California-Irvine and NASA researchers.

But the “water security of the Colorado River basin” is an important concept, if you are one of the 40 million people who rely on the Colorado River for drinking water, a group that includes residents of Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, and San Diego. Or if you enjoy eating vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and spinach during the winter. Through the many diversions, dams, canals, and reservoirs the river feeds as it snakes its way from the Rockies toward Mexico, the Colorado also provides the irrigation that makes the desert bloom in California’s Imperial Valley and Arizona’s Yuma County—source of more than two-thirds of US winter vegetable production.

We’ve known for a while that the river’s ability to meet such demands has become increasingly strained. Climate change means less snowmelt in the Rockies, the river’s source, and a 14-year drought in the Southwest has further impeded its flow, while adding to the demand on it. “The once broad and blue river has in many places dwindled to a murky brown trickle,” the New York Times reported in January. “Reservoirs have shrunk to less than half their capacities, the canyon walls around them ringed with white mineral deposits where water once lapped.”

Lake Mead, the vast Nevada reservoir that traps a portion of the Colorado’s annual flow for distribution to its various users, has sunk to its lowest level since its creation in the 1930s, under pressure from the past decade and a half of drought. According to an excellent National Geographic piece by Sandra Postel of the Global Water Policy Project, Lake Mead was hovering near capacity when the drought started in 2000, equivalent to about two full years of Colorado River water. Today, it holds just nine months worth of river flow—a steep drop.

But the new paper suggests that the situation is even worse than we previously knew. In addition to rapidly drawing down Lake Mead, the region’s thirst for water has extended underground: to the region’s aquifers. For a project called the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, NASA satellites circle the Earth and carefully measure its mass. “Because changes in water storage result in changes in mass, GRACE provides fairly accurate estimates of water depletion over time,” Postel explains.

And here’s what GRACE researchers found in the Colorado River Basin region: To make up for the gap between what the Colorado River supplies and what people and agriculture demand, farmers, landowners, and municipalities are dropping wells and tapping underground aquifers at a much faster rate than had been assumed. Between December 2004 and November 2013, the Colorado Basin surrendered almost 53 million acre-feet of underground water—roughly equal to about 1.5 full Lake Meads, siphoned away in just nine years.

“Quite honestly, we are alarmed and concerned about the implications of our findings,” study coauthor Jay Famiglietti, a senior water scientist at NASA and a professor of at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in a blog post. “From a group that studies groundwater depletion in the hottest of the hot spots of water stress around the world—in India, the Middle East, and in California’s Central Valley—that says something.”

Famiglietti’s alarm stems from the fact that in the West, groundwater is essentially a nonrenewable resource. “When we use it, it’s gone,” he writes. No one knows how much is left, but it’s pretty clear that the region can’t keep draining its aquifers at the rate of 1.5 Lake Meads worth every nine years. But because of climate change, the region can expect more frequent droughts and less overall water from the Colorado. In short, Famiglietti writes, “The American West is running out of water.”

Which means it’s probably time to reconsider the region’s Wild West style of regulating groundwater. “If you own the property, the vagueries of groundwater law often mean that you can dig the wells and pump to your heart’s content,” Famiglietti writes. “Multiply that by millions of private wells and you get the picture.”",2014-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['drying', 'million', 'depend', 'west', 'groundwater', 'drought', 'basin', '40', 'writes', 'jones', 'lake', 'colorado', 'water', 'mother', 'wells', 'river']",China,news article,English

A. Situation analysis

Description of the Disaster

01 May 2021: The Government of Somalia declared a National Emergency due to the Drought situation and called for support in responding to the humanitarian crisis. According to UNOCHA Somalia situational Update of April 26th 2021 and the IFRC Regional Information Bulletin (RIB), the already dire humanitarian situation in Somalia has been deteriorating since the failed Deyr short rains late 2020, especially in the eight targeted districts in the table below:

This affected crop production, pasture regeneration and failed to sufficiently replenish water sources for communities in the eight (8) targeted districts.

The earliest onset of the prolonged Jilaal dry season in late 2020 depleted the little pasture and water sources available for the very vulnerable households in these districts. The late onset of the insufficient and poorly distributed Guu long rains 2021 is projected to be inadequate till June, unlikely to sufficiently replenish water sources and regenerate pasture. The back-to-back poor performance of the Deyr and Guu with a harsh Jilaal in-between eroded the resilience of the targeted communities.

Access to clean water is compromised with the cost of water spiking by 60% in these districts and vulnerable households having to travel long distances in search of water. Vulnerable households have resorted to negative coping strategies. Poor hygiene practices are on the rise putting the health and nutrition of vulnerable <5-year-olds and pregnant women at increased risk. Herders are resorting to hand-feeding their livestock with locally produced cereals. This has caused cereal prices to increase by at least 30% and livestock disease are being reported.

The map below courtesy of FAO and SWALIM shows the targeted districts within the larger IPC-4 zone. For related IPC classification see https://fews.net/east-africa/somalia

Summary of the current response

Overview of Host National Society Response Action

In response to the emerging drought as a result of failed Deyr (short rains) season September-December 2020, SRCS convened a Partners call in December 2020. The objective was to flag the imminent drought and collectively agree on the next steps moving forward. Two key resolutions reached were: 1) SRCS participates in the planned Government-led interagency drought rapid assessment, and 2) SRCS closely monitors the situation and share periodic updates with partners. SRCS convened a second follow up Partners call in early February 2021 during which the Drought rapid assessment findings for Somaliland were shared and discussed.

The meeting resolved that SRCS focuses and prioritizes areas / sectors of intervention, develops a Preparedness for Effective Response (PER) Plan and shares with members. SRCS further prepared and submitted a proposal to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) for consideration. This operational plan is therefore prepared based on the conclusion and sector-specific recommendations of the assessment. Furthermore, the plan is triggered by the Government’s Declaration of a National Drought Emergency on the 01 of May. The eight (8) targeted districts are pockets inside the larger Puntland and Somaliland regions, some already classified to be in IPC-4.

Based on the above, this DREF Operation will initially focus on 1) Livelihood and Basic needs support through Unconditional Mobile Cash Transfer to meet basic needs of households and, 2) Health / Nutrition through additional Emergency Mobile Health Clinics (EMHCs). Subsequent action will depend on the evolution of the drought emergency.",2021-05-15 06:12:50+00:00,"['epoa', 'water', 'households', 'n', 'mdrs0011', 'action', 'situation', 'emergency', 'plan', 'drought', 'operation', 'targeted', 'vulnerable', 'districts', 'dref', 'srcs', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

According to a photo-story by UK-based Daily Mail, the incident took place in Noakhali, Bangladesh where wildlife photographer Hasibul Wahab had captured this brave act by a teenager named Belal. “During the ordeal onlookers were unsure whether the boy was going to appear again. When he finally made it to the other side the locals cheered as the deer was reunited with its family.”, stated the report.

The report includes several pictures of the incident.

In 2016, Assam government in a major goof-up had included one such image in its interim report on Assam floods to Union home minister Rajnath Singh.

The other image was shot during the 2016 floods in Andhra Pradesh. Here, a desperate father was carrying his sick baby on his head through deep floodwaters to reach the nearest hospital in the state. “Pangi Satibabu, 30, a farmer, from Kudumusare village in Andhra Pradesh, carried his six-month-old daughter above his head for three miles to the nearest health centre after heavy rainfall led to a deluge.”, stated an article published by Daily Mail on September 29, 2016.

In conclusion, old and unrelated photographs clicked during floods in Bangladesh and Andhra Pradesh, India were shared as the impact of the recent floods in Assam.

629,Drought Sri Lanka,"Panama Canal drought, linked to El Niño, highlights climate fears - The Hindu",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/panama-canal-drought-linked-to-el-nio-highlights-climate-fears/article26990704.ece,"The driest period in memory for the canal basin is also hitting small indigenous villages that depend on tourism along the tributaries of the inter-oceanic passage.

An intense drought related to this year’s El Niño phenomenon has precipitously lowered the level of Panama’s Gatun Lake, forcing the country’s Canal Authority to impose draft limits this week on ships moving through the waterway’s recently expanded locks.

The restrictions on how deep the vessels can reach below the surface means large ships, primarily from the United States and China, must pass through with less cargo, which translates into lower revenue for the voyages. The driest period in memory for the canal basin is also hitting small indigenous villages that depend on tourism along the tributaries of the inter-oceanic passage.

The economic hit to canal operators stands to be minor an estimated $15 million this year, compared with the $2.5 billion in revenue generated in 2018. But the drought and the resulting restrictions highlight the difficulties Panama faces in satisfying increased demand for fresh water to feed the canal while irrigating fields and keeping the taps flowing in the capital as climate change threatens more extreme weather events.

“This year I do not think there will be problems with drinking water... due to the resources we have,” Steve Paton, who heads the long-term climate monitoring programme at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, said, referring to an accumulation of rainfall from the last rainy season.

“As for the future, it is difficult to forecast,” Mr. Paton continued. “But we are observing in the canal area that climatic events are becoming increasingly extreme. ...The biggest droughts and the eight or nine largest storms have occurred in the last 20 years, in the same way that 2014 to 2016 were the driest years in the canal’s history.”

El Niño is a recurring phenomenon in which warm ocean temperatures in the Pacific lead to drier than usual conditions in some areas and wetter in others.

Carlos Vargas, vice-president of environment and water for the Canal Authority, said recently that Gatun one of the largest artificial lakes in the world, with an area of 436 sq. km was 4.6 feet (1.4 metre) below normal levels for this time of year. It has dropped more than a half foot (0.2 metre) since early April. A smaller lake that also supplies the waterway, Alajuela, was 7.2 feet (2.2 metre) below usual.

“These low levels in the Panama Canal are the product of four or five months of almost zero precipitation,” Mr. Vargas said. “It really has been the driest dry season we’ve had in the history of the canal. The flow of rivers to the lake is down 60%.”

That forced the Canal Authority to notify customers in early April that the maximum freshwater draft of 44 feet (13.41 metre) for Neopanamax vessels would be a foot less beginning at the end of the month. It marks the fourth reduction in drafts imposed during the current dry season, which runs from January through April. When water levels are optimal, maximum draft for those ships is about 50 feet (15.2 metre).

The limits affect only the Cocoli and Agua Clara Locks, a multibillion-dollar project inaugurated in 2016 to accommodate the larger Neopanamax ships. On average, 7 1/2 vessels move through those locks daily day, though there have been days with as many as 12 crossings.

The canal charges shipping companies based on a vessel’s capacity and also a percentage of the cargo it carries, so lighter ships mean less profit for everyone.

The Canal Authority has had to deal with extreme weather patterns in the past. A severe dry season also associated with El Niño in 2015-2016 affected the crossing of cargo in the old locks and cost $40 million in revenue.

The canal and most Panamanians rely on rains over a watershed of more than 3,000 sq. km covered with forests, rivers and lakes that generates 95% of the water consumed by Panama City and Colon, whose metro areas combined are home to nearly half the country’s population of just over 4 million.

Panama has one of the highest levels of annual rainfall among tropical countries. Last year marked one of the highest amounts of rainfall on record for the basin, which experts say has helped cushion the ravages of the current drought.

“Gatun and Alajuela lakes have been below optimum levels, but on the other hand it could have been much worse,” Mr. Paton said.

The canal is promoting short-term drought measures such as suspending generation of hydroelectric power at Gatun as well as water recycling via tubs in the new locks that cut water use by 60%.

“This has helped us alleviate the effect for the moment,” Mr. Vargas said. “In the medium term, we will continue with reforestation programs in the basin” that have already resulted in more than 17,000 acres (7,000 hectares) of plantings.

Mr. Paton forecast that the canal has enough water to last at least 18 years, although if extreme climate patterns persist, water could reach precariously low levels within 15 years.

The Canal Authority says it needs more water reserves to cushion the impact of extreme events. Canal administrator Jorge Luis Quijano has said that before considering another set of locks, an additional source on the scale of Gatun or Alajuela would be necessary. The lakes fill when it rains heavily, but there is no place to store that surplus during the dry season.

During a recent boat tour of Gatun, numerous tree trunks flooded more than a century ago when the lake was created were dried out and exposed to the sun.

Water supply for citizens so far has not been affected by the drought, but small indigenous communities scattered along the Gatun’s tributaries have been hit.

Telvinia Tascūn, an artisan in San Antonio Wounaan on the Gatun river, said tourists typically visit every day to buy handicrafts, but lately the outboard motorboats are having trouble navigating the depleted channels and the logs and mud at the docks.

Relief for them and canal operators could come by late May or mid-June, when torrential rains from the wet season fill the lakes.

“This is the strongest drought we can recall,” Mr. Tascūn said. “For me it’s sad. This never happened to us.”",2019-04-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['gatun', 'levels', 'ships', 'extreme', 'fears', 'water', 'niño', 'el', 'drought', 'climate', 'canal', 'panama', 'mr', 'locks', 'lake', 'highlights', 'linked']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
755,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Zimbabwe: Zim On an Electricity Prayer As Another Drought Looms - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908080202.html,"Zimbabwe's power crisis is unlikely to end any time soon amid fears another drought is looming, Energy Minister Fortune Chasi warned this week.

The country's foremost hydro-electric power station, Kariba is likely to shut-down for the first time since it was established in the last 1950s as water levels have hit record lows forcing the country into a crippling 18hr load-shedding schedule.

Chasi told a post-Cabinet media briefing Tuesday that the coming season could present further problems for power generation at Kariba.

""It has been posited that we are looking at possibly another drought, meaning that Kariba will be in sharp focus and that it will become more difficult to generate therefore.

""The situation on power really does not require a comment from me. I think all of us experience the challenges,"" said Chasi.

""The dam is now at 23% full, leaving us with really 3 metres of live water which is water that is usable for generation of power. We continue to pray that we have rains and that if they occur they will be significant enough to improve our capacity to generate power.""

The Famine Early Warning System (FEWS), a US agency has already predicted a crisis is looming in rainfall and food for the 2019/2020 season.

After two weeks shuttling between Harare and Johannesburg, South Africa, Chasi managed to convince the neighbouring country's State power producer Eskom to resume power supplies to the embattled Zesa, tied to a massive US$890 000 per week payment as part of a debt clearance plan to clear an outstanding US$25 million.

Although the 400MW may ease the crisis to some extent, the situation has not been made better by Zesa's subdued production at its Hwange, Harare and Munyati stations.

The three power stations are producing 42MW against a possible 60MW.

Kariba Power Station which at full capacity produces 1 039MW, is producing 461MW, leaving a shortfall of 582MW.

The country's electricity demand stands at 1 400MW, according to Energy Ministry statistics.

13,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Ukraine-Russia Conflict Results In “Water War” - Water Online,https://www.wateronline.com/doc/ukraine-russia-conflict-results-in-water-war-0001,"By Sara Jerome,

@sarmje

Water utilities have been at the center of international political unrest this year as a result of the ""water war"" in Crimea.

""Crimeans voted to break off from Ukraine and join Russia. Their vote represents the re-establishment of a historic cultural relationship. But take away the emotional side of the Crimean referendum and reality hits home -- the economic challenges that are yet to knock on their door,"" CNN reported.

Water service is among the major challenges.

""According to Ukrainian news agencies, [Ukraine's government] has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85 percent of fresh water from this canal, which was built in [between] 1961 and 1971,"" ITAR TASS reported.

That creates an expensive issue for Crimea, and for Russia, its new homeland. It will take up to $417 million to solve the problem of water service for Crimea, the report said.

The water problem emerged as a central front in the tug-of-war between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

""Satellite images show that [Ukraine] is deliberately trying to cut off Crimea peninsula's water supply by building a dam. In the meantime Russian scientists are trying to find ways to supply Crimea with fresh water,"" RT reported.

The result is an all-out ""water war.""

""Amid the water war between Ukraine and Russia; the former and the current occupiers of the Muslim Autonomous Republic of Crimea, harvest in the devastated Muslim country has been despoiled, but the water war may take more victims, with two major Crimean chemical plants near closure because of a water shortage,"" OnIslam reported, citing a Crimean official.

Crimea formerly depended on Ukraine for water, Pravda reported this month.

Ukraine ""provided up to 85 percent of fresh water supplies to the Crimea through the North Crimean Canal from the Dnieper River. The water was used to irrigate farmland. However, after the reunification of the Crimea with Russia, the new authorities of Ukraine completely cut water supplies from the North Crimean Canal to the republic,"" the report said.

Russia is trying to solve the water problem.

""The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation delivers fresh drinking water to the Crimea from artesian wells,"" the report said.

""Experts from the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources are developing ways to supply fresh water to the Crimea from the Kuban River in the Krasnodar region to the North Crimean Canal which now receives limited water-flow, as Kiev tightens the lid,"" RT reported.

Russian official Dmitry Kirillov told reporters that the country is exploring its options.

“As one of options of providing the peninsula with water, we are considering an option of drawing water supply from the Kuban River and channeling it through the Strait of Kerch to the end portion of North Crimean Canal,” he said, per RT.

Desalination has also been viewed as a potential solution.

""Russia is debating the construction of desalination plants in Crimea to solve the peninsula’s water supply problem,"" RIONOVOSTI reported, citing a Russian official.

""[New] desalination technology and desalination plants could be used in Crimea, because there are many underground salt lakes on the peninsula. Singapore uses desalinized water for irrigation and for technical purposes; the same can be done in Crimea,"" a Russian official said.",2014-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['north', 'supply', 'russian', 'fresh', 'conflict', 'crimea', 'ukrainerussia', 'crimean', 'results', 'war', 'ukraine', 'water', 'canal', 'russia']",China,news article,English
320,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Surfing helps veterans cope with PTSD - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/surfing-helps-veterans-cope-with-ptsd-60472,"Surfing often conjures up images of freewheeling hippies, but now military veterans are turning to the waves to help them deal with the traumatic legacy of war. They say it gives them a wonderful “freeing” feeling, and helps them manage the psychological turmoil of their everyday lives. Our research is among the first to document the positive influence surfing can have for veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

PTSD is a debilitating psychological condition that some veterans experience in the aftermath of combat. The symptoms can include flashbacks, vivid nightmares, traumatic memories, and a profound and enduring sense of sadness. There are other symptoms of PTSD too, including hyper-vigilance (such as scanning rooftops for concealed snipers) and hyper-arousal (the classic example of jumping when a car back-fires).

You could be forgiven for believing that all soldiers inevitably come home from war damaged by their experiences, and that a “tidal wave” of PTSD cases are flooding out of the military. But research from Kings College London suggests that the rate of combat veterans being diagnosed with PTSD is around 7%.

Moving meditation

So how could surfing help? In our research we asked British war veterans about their experiences. Their stories – collected over a series of in-depth interviews and observations – reveal the strong emotional benefits that surfing brings. According to the veterans, surfing is like having PTSD “pummelled out” of their system by the force of the waves.

The mental state veterans report when surfing has many parallels with what psychologists call “flow”, where a person becomes fully and completely involved in an activity to the exclusion of everything else. Their minds are emptied of the traumatic memories that continually cycle through them. They become immersed in the activity, much like a moving form of mindfulness or meditation.

When surfing, veterans are rooted in the present moment and experience it with a renewed sense of intensity and pleasure. There’s also a connection with nature that helps to bolster veterans’ sense of mental well-being. When surfing, veterans are immersed in the natural environment, which has mental health benefits according to a growing body of research. As studies conducted with veterans in California suggest, it also helps build resilience, and alleviates the troubling symptoms associated with PTSD and depression.

But surfing is not the only complementary therapy being proposed for veterans suffering from PTSD. A wide range of activities are now being tested. These are often provided by charities and include horse therapy, gardening therapy, fly-fishing, sailing, drama therapy and yoga.

The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends psychological therapies, including trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprogramming. Antidepressants are also recommended for those who don’t want, or don’t respond to talking therapies. Although these treatments help some veterans, they don’t work for everyone. That’s why it’s important that different forms of treatment and support for veterans experiencing PTSD can be shown to be effective.

Indeed, at a time when military charities are coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed solutions to veterans’ mental health, identifying the impact that new approaches have, and the reasons behind such impact, is crucial.

One priority for research in this area now is to understand how innovative approaches like surfing can work alongside clinical approaches to benefit the mental health of veterans struggling to adapt in the aftermath of trauma.",2016-06-15 07:00:00+00:00,"['research', 'ptsd', 'helps', 'traumatic', 'veterans', 'cope', 'therapy', 'health', 'symptoms', 'surfing', 'mental', 'war']",India,news article,English
217,Drought Sri Lanka,SL on top despite Cremer's maiden ton | cricket.com.au - cricket.com.au,https://www.cricket.com.au/news/match-report/day-three-zimbabwe-sri-lanka-first-test-harare-match-report/2016-11-01,"Graeme the Cremer of the crop in Harare

Graeme Cremer begun the day without a Test fifty and a batting average of 10.75 but the Zimbabwe captain struck an unlikely maiden century to keep Sri Lanka at bay in the first Test in Harare.

But Cremer’s gritty knock could not prevent his side from going to stumps on day three with a heavy deficit.

The leg-spinner, who arrived at the crease in Harare with Zimbabwe 6-139 in reply to Sri Lanka’s 537 and facing the prospect of following on, hit 102 not out to drag the home side to 373 all out.

Quick Single: Ten-year drought ends as Sri Lanka take control

By the close of play on Monday, Sri Lanka had reached 0-5 in their second innings to lead by 169.

Cremer’s previous highest score in Test cricket was 43, but he showed his batsmen what was possible with a bit of application as he batted for over four hours.

Zimbabwe’s collapse in the morning had owed more to a series of rash strokes than trying conditions or outstanding bowling.

They resumed on a promising 1-88, but soon saw opener Tino Mawoyo pull a short ball from Suranga Lakmal straight to deep midwicket to depart for 45, and two overs later Hamilton Masakadza prodded forward to edge Lakmal to slip for 33.

Sean Williams then picked out the man in the deep with a careless sweep, before Craig Ervine and Malcolm Waller were trapped lbw by Dilruwan Perera.

Day one: Perera posts ton as SL dominate

At 6-139, Zimbabwe were in danger of being shot out and being forced to bat again but Peter Moor’s counter-attacking knock changed the momentum of the innings.

His two early sixes forced the field back, while Cremer was content to provide dogged support from the other end.

""I think we bat quite well together because PJ plays some big shots and keeps the scoreboard ticking, and I know that I can block out a maiden if I need to and just get off strike,” said Cremer.

“So that helps me a lot, knowing there’s someone on the other end scoring.”

Moor went on to score a career-best 79 in a 132-run stand with Cremer which only ended when Lahiru Kumara produced a fearsome bouncer that Moor fended to slip.

Kumara went on to knock Cremer’s helmet off his head and rattle the Zimbabwe skipper, who was then fortunate to see a hook sht off Kumara dropped at deep backward square-leg with his score on 58.

Cremer went on to add 92 for the eighth wicket with Donald Tiripano as Zimbabwe’s tail continued to wag, but nearly ran out of partners on 99 when the ninth wicket went down.

Zimbabwe’s final batsman Chris Mpofu managed to hold off Rangana Herath to give Cremer his chance, and the 30-year-old duly went to three figures to cap an impressive feat for a batsman whose Test average was only just in double digits prior to the Test.

First-ball heartbreak for Mumba

“I hadn’t got 50 before in Test cricket and I don’t even have a five-for yet, so it was quite special,” said Cremer.

“When I got to 75, I started thinking, ‘There’s a chance here.’ Then I thought I might run out of partners.

Even a special paddy variety such as seeraga samba has not escaped the clutches of drought this year.

Just as basmati, this is a costly variety used exclusively for “biriyani”. Except the Uppiliyapuram panchayat union of Thuraiyur taluk of Tiruchi district, the variety is not raised in any other place in the State. V.C.Natarajan, a fertilizer dealer and agriculturist of Vairichettipalayam, who raises the variety, says that a few farmers of Lalgudi and Kumbakonam too raise this crop once in a while. But they have not been successful. Similarly, almost the entire farming community in the half-a-dozen villages in the block go in only for this variety and rarely for PBT or any other variety.

M.Radhakrishnan, who has raised seeraga samba in about five acres, says this variety has been in existence in Uppiliyapuram region for more than half a century.

They point out that this variety is raised in about 5,000 acres in the area adjoining Kolli Hills. “Our fields are hardly four kilometres from Namakkal district border.”

Apart from Vairichettipalayam, the variety is also raised in Kottapalayam, B.Mettur, and Thanganagar.

The major reason for the fertility of this region is the water from the hills.

“There are fountains and also a few tanks which are fed by the bigger tank called Jamberi”.

“As it is not used for normal food, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation does not procure this variety. This year, seeraga samba rice is selling around Rs.60 a kg. While the new seeraga samba paddy is sold at Rs.2, 500 a bag (80 kg), old paddy is quoting around Rs.3,000 a bag. Last year, it was ruling around Rs.1, 500 a bag and in 2011 it was Rs.1,900.

They also point out that the entire yield from these 5,000 acres is bought by about 60-70 merchants at the local level who hull it locally in about half a dozen units and sell it in Tiruchi, Salem, Tirupur, Coimbatore, and Pollachi markets.

The farmers who raise seeraga samba used to have three crops a year – first is seeraga samba (150 day crop that is planted during the first week of September for harvest by the end of January or the first half of February) followed by short-term variety ADT 43 (85-105 days) and finally they go in for ADT 43 again.

“Normally we used to get at least 25 bags of paddy (80 kilograms each). This year the harvest is yet to start and we are not sure whether we would be able to get even 10-12 bags because we also had to face drought conditions in certain parts of the region, especially the northern portion of Vairichettipalayam.”

“Even the water from the Ahayagangai fountain of the Kolli Hills could not help us much and there has been hardly any monsoon rain .”

If the same conditions were to persist, they are not certain whether they could go in for short-term crop now.

“Of course, we are not concerned over Cauvery and Karnataka’s recalcitrance to release water to Tamil Nadu as we are far away from the river,” they added.",2013-02-02 08:00:00+00:00,"['raised', 'seeraga', 'uppiliyapuram', 'water', 'region', 'drought', 'half', 'used', 'variety', 'clutch', 'samba', 'paddy']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

* Strict quarantine measures extended by at least a week

* Philippines logs its second-highest daily Covid-19 cases

* Hospitals in the capital reach critical capacity

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has extended a strict lockdown in the capital region and adjacent provinces by at least one week to try to contain a renewed surge in coronavirus infections, his spokesman said on Saturday.

The Philippines, which has the second-highest Covid-19 cases and deaths in Southeast Asia, reported 12,576 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, putting further strain on the healthcare system.

Restrictions, which include a ban on non-essential movement, mass gatherings and dining in restaurants, will remain for at least another week, Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said in a televised announcement. The measures had been set to end on April 4.

""This will go with intensified prevention, detection, isolation, tracing and rehabilitation that we will monitor on a daily basis,"" Roque said.

Active cases in the country have hit a record 165,715, 96% of which were mild, health ministry data showed.

But intensive care capacity in the capital region's hospitals have reached a critical level, with 80% of beds utilised and many hospitals being forced to turn away patients.

The congested capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities home to at least 13 million people, accounts for two-fifths of the country's 784,043 confirmed cases and a third of the total 13,423 deaths. A University of the Philippines research team on Saturday called for a speedy construction of isolation facilities to prevent infections spreading through households.

Extended coronavirus curbs will continue to hurt the Philippines' economy, which posted a record 9.5% slump last year.

The Philippines has so far inoculated nearly 739,000 people. This is just 1% of its target of vaccinating 70 million of its 108 million population to achieve herd immunity and safely reopen the economy.",2021-04-03 12:01:00+00:00,"['duterte', 'strict', 'provinces', 'nearby', 'spokesman', 'week', 'hospitals', 'philippines', 'coronavirus', 'capital', 'million', 'infections', 'curbs', 'cases', 'extends']",India,news article,English
1262,FL-2018-000134-IND,Live in the City but Want to Grow a Mini Forest? This Unique Startup Will Help You! - The Better India,https://www.thebetterindia.com/155524/city-mini-forest-startup-hosachiguru/,"This article has been powered by Hosachiguru

Four years ago, three engineers decided to quit their lucrative jobs at the peak of their careers. The reason? They wanted to undertake scientific and mechanised agriculture.

While the initial idea of the Bengaluru-based trio–Ashok Jayanthi, Sriram Chitlur and Srinath Setty, was to find a piece of land close to the city where they could practice organic farming and grow chemical-free food for their families, little did they know it would culminate into an innovative agri-startup, today known as Hosachiguru.

What is Hosachiguru?

Originating from the Kannada terms ‘hosa’ which means ‘new’ and ‘chiguru’ which means ‘sprout’, Hosachiguru is a leading agricultural asset management startup that is running over 30 sustainable green projects on 800 acres of land.

When you think about investments, you might consider buying a plot of land away from the city where you’d spend more of your savings, perhaps building a home that you may or may not live in for the next decade. But what if we told you, despite living in the city, you could invest and buy a piece of land, which could be transformed into a mini-forest and get you returns ?

And you don’t even have to think about its maintenance. Everything will be done for you! Plus, you’ll have organically grown and pesticide-free produce from this mini-forest delivered at your doorstep weekly.

Sounds utopian?

Well, the Bengaluru-based agricultural asset management startup with its latest Eco-habitat project is doing exactly that!

Speaking to The Better India, the trio explains the inception of the company saying,

“When we decided to take up farming ourselves, and hunted for farmland, we travelled across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. It was during this ground research that we realised that procuring, buying as well as maintaining farmland was no child’s play. Either the cost of the land was too high, or it was too remote to be within our reach. But we were passionate about farming and willing to go the extra mile. As a company, we decided to procure 20-30 acres of farmland. We fenced it, dug borewells, sowed seeds, got farm labour, all by ourselves. But slowly our work started piquing the curiosity of those in our social circles. People started asking us for tips.

Sriram Chitlur shares, “It was at the time we thought, why don’t we sell the pieces of land to these people and manage it on their behalf. That’s how we started getting customers on board and started rolling one project after another.”

Whether it is their retail project that helps investors get long-term income from timber cultivation or their upcoming eco-habitat project, their road to success was full of challenges.

The trio travelled across the globe to understand the best-mechanised farming practices. Despite the massive exposure to a wide range of practices across different countries, they decided to come up with the own techniques to ensure that they brought down the cost without compromising on quality, while also ensuring maximum yield and profit.

Srinath observes, “While the labour costs to maintain an acre or two of land is as high as Rs 30,000 – 40,000 a month, we had to innovate techniques and build operations at a scale to ensure the same piece of land only required a labour cost of Rs 5000 a month thus ensuring better returns for our stakeholders.”

How are their methods different from those used by traditional farmers?

Regular farms are designed by the farmers, based on years of knowledge and experience. But one cannot overlook the fact that if a farmer maintains an acre of land, his primary premise is to rely on rainwater and grow cash crops like pulses and brown rice during the monsoons. Many farmers don’t have the scope nor the resources to scale up their operations or use mechanisation for the small piece of land. Plus, the lack of insurance, marketing challenges and uncertainty of climate, only add to their woes.

With the resources and mechanisation available at their disposal, Hosachiguru follows some sustainable and mechanised practices. A classic example of this is how they dedicate a few acres of farmland and turn it into a catchment area for rainwater harvesting with contour bunds, drenches, compartment bunds, soaking pits, mounds etc.

Promotion

In 2016 alone, they were able to save a whopping 1.2 crore litres of water on a 35–acre farm during heavy rains that lasted 45 minutes. This water lasted them for seven months until the dry summers. And so, they have successfully built a system where they are not reliant on groundwater for sustenance.

Besides this, Hosachiguru also uses the method of biodiverse farming to replicate the ecosystem of natural forests with zero residue farming methods, bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides, live mulching, intercropping, integrated pest management and the inclusion of a diverse variety of herbal plants.

“So all you have to do is own or invest in a piece of farmland, and we will manage it for you with the best agricultural practices. You don’t have to worry about the farm operations, labour, power & water availability, soil conditions, sale of produce etc. You can enjoy the true spirit of the farm by getting chemically free produce at your doorstep,” says Sriram Chitlur.

Additionally, you can also visit the land whenever you please, participate in the farm activities, enjoy the hospitality or just bask in the glory of your mini-forest!

Under its latest eco-habitat project which is spread on 16.5 acres and is an hour away from the international airport in Bengaluru, Hosachiguru is selling quarter acre farm plots.

Each of these plots will be demarcated, have road access, water supply through drip irrigation and underground pipes, access to borewell, centralised water distribution and a nursery to grow fruits and vegetable plants.

This project will also have sustainable homes built using compact stabilised earth bricks (CSEB) to serve as weekend getaways or post-retirement dream homes close to nature.

Today, Hosachiguru has over 100 customers who have bought various farmland projects, and the number is only growing. The average investment required for a project is Rs 15-18 lakh per unit. In the next 365 days, the trio envisions to add another 1,000 acres of land to expand their projects.

Today, Hosachiguru works with over 300 farm labourers living in native villages close to their farmlands spread across the three states. Many of these labourers are uneducated and come from impoverished backgrounds. But the team at Hosachiguru has helped them unlearn unscientific agricultural practices and skilled them in sustainable practices.

These farmhands (which include many landless labourers and several others with small but barren pieces of land) are not only successfully maintaining the day-to-day working of Hosachiguru’s extensive agriculture projects spread over 800 acres of land but are also replicating similar sustainable practices like maintaining biodiversity, multi-crop management, bunding etc., on their land to make it agriculturally viable.

What’s better than investing in a property that gives your life a purpose and ensures food security for your future generations besides transforming the lives of the underprivileged?

148,Drought Sri Lanka,GIEWS Country Brief: Sri Lanka 17-January-2017 - Sri Lanka - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/giews-country-brief-sri-lanka-17-january-2017,"FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT

“Maha” cereal crop in 2017 significantly impaired by dry weather conditions

Rice import needs forecast to increase in 2017

Prices of rice hit record levels in December, while those of wheat remain generally stable

Large numbers of people affected by lingering effects of drought in 2016

Dry weather conditions impair the 2017 “maha” cereal output significantly

The bulk of the 2017 largely irrigated “maha” rice crop, normally accounting for 65 percent of the annual production, was planted by the end of December. The below-average rainfall since the start of the season in October, coupled with low irrigation water availability, resulted in significant cuts in the area planted, further reducing yield prospects for the season. The latest official estimates of plantings indicate that, as of end-November, 327 000 hectares were put under the 2017 “maha” paddy crop, 50 percent below the area planted at the same time in 2016. The FAO’s Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) for the 3 dekad of December 2016 indicated a risk of drought conditions developing in various main rice-producing areas, including Northern, North Central and Eastern provinces. As a result, FAO’s outlook for the 2017 “maha” season paddy output is unfavourable. Given the current low water levels in main reservoirs, there is also concern for the 2017 irrigated secondary “yala” crop, to be planted from April, if rains do not improve in the coming weeks.

Prospects for the 2017 main season maize crop, to be harvested from February, are also unfavourable, due to the dry spell.

Rice import requirements forecast to increase in 2017 on expectations of reduced output

Total cereal imports requirements in 2017 are forecast to increase from last year’s already high level. The increase is mainly driven by the unfavourable prospects for the 2017 rice production. Imports of wheat, which is not produced domestically, are anticipated to remain at last year’s high level of 1.2 million tonnes, reflecting strong domestic demand.

Prices of rice hit record levels in December, while those of wheat generally stable

Domestic prices of rice, the main staple food in the country, rose considerably for four consecutive months, reaching record levels in December 2016. The spike in prices is due to the reduced 2016 secondary “yala” output, harvested in September, and the unfavourable prospects for the main 2017 “maha” crop. In an attempt to ease rice prices, the Government began releasing paddy from public stocks to millers in late December. In addition, the Government plans to import rice and reduce duties and taxes on imported rice in early January 2017. Wheat prices remained overall stable, reflecting adequate market availabilities, following the high level of imports in recent months.

Concerns remain for vulnerable rural groups

Food security conditions are expected to deteriorate on expectations of significant cereal production losses for the ongoing “maha” season, which follows a reduced “yala” harvest in 2016. Subsistence farm households, particularly in the North Western, North Central, Uva and Southern provinces, will likely be most affected and require some humanitarian and emergency recovery assistance. According to the Disaster Management Centre, almost 1 million people in 23 out of 25 districts have been negatively affected by drought conditions. Record prices of rice negatively affect food access and further stress the food security situation of the most vulnerable populations.",2017-01-17 08:00:00+00:00,"['crop', '17january2017', 'lanka', 'sri', 'season', '2016', 'country', 'maha', 'prices', 'unfavourable', 'brief', '2017', 'main', 'giews', 'rice', 'wheat']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
580,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought in Africa leaves 45 million in need across 14 countries - The New Humanitarian,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2019/06/10/drought-africa-2019-45-million-in-need,"NAIROBI

Failed rains across eastern Africa, southern Africa, and the Horn of Africa are seeing another dire season for farmers, increasing food prices and driving up the aid needs of tens of millions of already vulnerable people across the three regions.

All told, more than 45 million people will struggle to find enough food across 14 countries in 2019, many feeling the compounded effects of years of drought.

It’s the second time in three years that an El Niño event has disrupted weather patterns. In 2017 – a year in which the UN labelled the crisis the worst in decades – some 38 million people were in need.

Drought again in 2018 was followed by significantly below-average rains at the beginning of this year – down by 50 percent in parts of southern Africa.

In the Horn and eastern Africa, delayed rains finally arrived in May, allowing some regrowth of pasture for grazing. But it has not been enough to offset the damage to people’s livelihoods and overall food security.

“We need to move to a system where we act much earlier on the warning signs of drought and hunger so that we can cut response times and costs, and reduce deaths and human suffering,” the UN’s Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, said in reference to the drought in the Horn.

The UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund has released $45 million to encourage major donors to do more to combat the effects of drought in parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

With an El Niño forecast more than six months ago, World Food Programme climatologist Jesse Mason argues there should have been time for governments and aid agencies to put in place risk-reduction measures: drought-resistant seeds, irrigation systems, and cash transfers to cushion the impact on farmers.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt.”

It can no longer be business as usual, Mason told The New Humanitarian. Southern and eastern Africa are on the front lines of climate change, and mitigation measures must now be much more data-driven, comprehensive, and innovative.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt,” said Mason, project manager at WFP’s forecast-based financing initiative. “The pieces need to come together, from the global forecasting to the way we interact with farmers on the ground based on that information.”

The following is a snapshot of needs across southern, eastern, and the Horn of Africa.

The term “food crisis” The term “food crisis” means households that are just about able to meet their basic food needs, but only by selling some essential assets like livestock. There may also be cases of malnutrition. A “food emergency” refers to very high levels of malnutrition and some deaths. All assets are liquidated, making recovery so much harder.

Angola

In need: 2.3 million

The government declared an emergency in the three southern provinces of Cunene, Huila, and Namibe in January. Angola has been pursuing a humanitarian self-reliance policy but the response has been inadequate and the situation is deteriorating.

Ethiopia

In need: 8.3 million

The most vulnerable communities have suffered consecutive years of drought. This season’s Gu long rains (March to May) were poor or delayed. Although a late burst of rainfall has helped replenish pasture in the south and southeast, it came too late for some crop-producing areas and the food security situation is expected to deteriorate. Numbers in need are exacerbated by mass internal displacement as a result of inter-communal violence – affecting some 2.6 million. Concerns are also rising over potential food aid pipeline breaks that could interrupt life-saving operations. It’s $1.3 billion aid appeal is only 15 percent funded.

Kenya

In need: 2.5 million

The long rains were similarly poor – less than half the expected amount fell by April. By July the number of severely food insecure is projected to more than double from the current 1.1 million to 2.5 million. Below-average terms of trade and reduced household incomes during the July to September dry season could push parts of eastern Kenya into crisis by August.

Lesotho

In need: 640,000

Four districts are at crisis or emergency levels – Mohale’s Hoek, Maseru, Quthing, and Qacha’s Nek. A total of 640,000 people are projected to be food insecure over the next 12 months. Lesotho has a population of 2.2 million.

Madagascar

In need: 1.3 million

By March, 1.3 million people were severely food insecure. Although the vulnerable southern region received fair rainfall this season, the harvest is forecast to be well below average. The south is yet to recover from the effects of the 2015/16 El Niño and the 2017/18 drought, and the number of children who are acutely malnourished is expected to rise in 2019.

Malawi

In need: 3.3 million

Some 2.8 million people are projected to be in crisis and 450,000 at emergency levels of food needs during the October to March lean season in the country’s southern and central districts.

Mozambique

In need: 1.85 million

More than 1.7 million people were identified as in crisis between September and December 2018 across 11 provinces. As a result of Cyclone Idai in March and Cyclone Kenneth in April, an estimated 1.85 million are now in need of aid.

Namibia

In need: 550,000

At the beginning of May the government declared a drought-induced state of emergency – the third time in six years. All regions of the country are affected, with 24 percent of the 2.3 million population facing food shortfalls.

Somalia

In need: 5.4 million

After two consecutive poor rainy seasons Somalia is facing yet another drought. The 2019 Gu rains (April to June) have failed, on top of a poor 2018 Deyr season (October to December), contributing to widespread crop failure and lower livestock productivity. Pastoral communities in the worst-affected areas – in the north and centre of the country – are facing acute food insecurity. Drought-related displacement is underway and malnutrition rates are rising. Food aid levels have “significantly declined” compared with last year. A $700 million drought response plan has been launched.

South Sudan

In need: 7.1 million

Conflict and drought has created a disastrous situation. Some 6.9 million people – close to 60 percent of the population – are currently facing severe food insecurity with an estimated 50,000 in “famine-like” conditions. In many areas, malnutrition levels remain critical, with some 860,000 children under the age of five estimated to be severely malnourished. Out of the overall 7.1 million people in need, only 5.7 million are targeted for aid. The aid appeal stands at $1.5 billion, but so far only $346 million has been received.

Sudan

In need: 5.6 million

Around one million people are facing emergency conditions – concentrated in the states of Khartoum and South Darfur. The Darfur region accounts for 45 percent of all Sudanese in need (crisis and emergency levels). Sudan’s crisis is less weather-related and more a consequence of food price rises. Overall, prices of grains were at record or near-record levels in March despite an above-average 2018 harvest. The depreciation of the local currency, fuel shortages and input costs combined to push up the cost of living - one of the triggers for the protests that led to the toppling of former president Omar al-Bashir in April.

Uganda

In need: Unknown

The arid Karamoja region – bordering Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia – has been hit by a second failed rainy season. Numbers in need are not yet known, but staple food prices are expected to remain high through to September, well above the five-year average.

Zambia

In need: 1.3 million

Maize producing areas in the south experienced their worst drought since 1981. Maize production is estimated to have dropped to two million tonnes from approximately 2.4 million tonnes last season and exports have been banned – which will impact prices in the region. The projected number of households needing food aid from July to February 2020 is 220,000 – a 38 percent increase from last season.

Zimbabwe

In need: 5.3 million

Total cereal production this season was estimated at 852,000 tonnes, against a national requirement of 1.8 million tonnes for human consumption and 450,000 tonnes for livestock. Compared to the 2017/18 season, the provinces of Manicaland, Matabeleland South, and Matabeleland North all saw their maize production drop by more than 70 percent. Climate shocks have compounded severe economic difficulties. By September, most of the country is expected to be in “crisis”.

She made the remarks during president Hage Geingob's townhall meeting at Ongwediva on Monday.

Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said the first round of distributions, which commenced in Oshana and which will end this month, has already registered 15 367 people as beneficiaries for the programme.

She thus urged Namibians earning a salary to emulate the example set by foreign donors and assist the drought relief programme by voluntarily making a 2% once-off donation from their salaries.

Contributions to the programme by the business sector and international donors now stand at N$104 million.

This is in addition to the government's estimated budget of N$570 million budgeted for the programme, which Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said might not be sufficient to benefit all drought-affected households and farmers.

""Political stability and peace are imperative prerequisite factors that guarantee economic growth and social well-being,"" Oshana governor Elia Irimari said at the start of the meeting.

(This personal story was one of three told to Gorata Fembo published by the IFRC’s Asia-Pacific regional office in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. It graphically illustrates what has become known as the ‘climate-conflict nexus’ that was the focus of the policy round table in The Hague last week.)



Shamsia Atayee, 35, is five months pregnant but hardly shows it. When she’s congratulated on her pregnancy, she forces a polite smile and says “thankyou’’ in a low tone.



“I would not wish a sixth child on anyone, certainly not in the state of poverty I am in.



“If it was by choice, I wouldn’t have fallen pregnant because we hardly survive. We have to borrow money for food.”

‘Baghlan used to be such a beautiful sight.

Now since the drought and conflict

everything is destroyed’

Drought and conflict robbed her family of a good life in Baghlan province. “My family’s income was reliant on crops and farming, as my husband used to grow and sell vegetables.



“On a week’s sale we could make enough to sustain the family’s food supply for a month, and we could buy clothes for our children and keep them warm during the cold winter.



“The drought has finished all our livestock; now it’s killing people. As our livestock died and our stored food ran out, we had nothing to live for in Baghlan.



“Conflict contributed to our hunger. We were tormented by the frequent exchange of firearms and explosions. We couldn’t go out to take care of our livestock.



“It is a double tragedy we are faced with. Baghlan used to be such a beautiful sight. Now, since the drought and conflict, everything is destroyed. There was grass then and livestock would graze, but now it is only hard patches of cracked lands and houses with bullet marks and broken bridges.



“Families are constantly on the move. When we migrated to Kabul, we travelled with other people from our community in search of a better life. The journey was filled with unimaginable suffering for us.



“In Kabul, we live in a rented two-room house costing 40 US dollars a month. Some months we can pay the rent, some we cannot.



“We used the last of our savings and my husband carried out small jobs in town. When we arrived in Kabul a couple of months back, my husband was employed as a security guard for government buildings but he was later retrenched, making life even harder for us here.



“Since falling pregnant, I have not visited the doctor for ante-natal care services. I was also diagnosed with a heart condition that requires close medical attention.



“In Baghlan, I used to visit the Afghan Red Crescent clinic, but since moving to Kabul I do not have the money to travel to the hospital. Once I had to pay a consultation fee which I did not have, and we ended up borrowing money from relatives. Life is far from easy here.”



Shamsia Atayee’s family has received emergency help from the Afghan Red Crescent Society. Aid includes shelter, household items such as kitchen sets, water containers, tarpaulins and blankets.

Pagasa warned residents of the said areas that flash floods or landslides are possible due to moderate to at times heavy rains.

Meanwhile, Metro Manila and the rest of the country will be partly cloudy with chances of isolated rain showers due to localized thunderstorms.

Pagasa said it does not expect a tropical cyclone or weather disturbance near or within the Philippine area of responsibility in the next two to three days.

551,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Drought is Leading to Instability and Water Weaponization in the Middle East and North Africa – Homeland Security Today - HSToday,https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/counterterrorism/drought-is-leading-to-instability-and-water-weaponization-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/,"Water stress is a growing problem worldwide. Overuse, population growth, and climate change are contributing to desperate conditions and violent extremist organizations (VEOs) are turning scarce water into a weapon. Nowhere is this trend more visible than in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a region of critical importance to U.S. national security interests. The MENA region has long been prone to both cyclical and discrete periods of droughts. There is mounting evidence suggesting that climate change, by driving significant winter precipitation decline, is increasing the frequency and severity of these events.

Climate change impacts that affected Syria could be a harbinger for other countries in the region. The connection between climate change and Syrian instability was first raised by our colleagues Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell in 2012, and confirmed by climate scientist and Center for Climate and Security Senior Fellow, Colin P. Kelley, and his colleagues, who linked the consequential 2007-2010 drought to a long-term warming trend in the eastern Mediterranean (finding that the drought was made 2-3 times more likely due to climate change).. Drought conditions as well as poorly-designed and discriminatory water policies implemented by the Assad regime and the Alawite elite were also factors that contributed to societal instability at the onset of the Syrian civil war. The regional climate model ALADIN corroborates previous studies projecting that the MENA region will continue to be a global hotspot for drought into the late twenty-first century.

Declining water security in MENA is expected to stem not only from climate change impacts but also from other factors such as pollution, population growth, government corruption, and unsustainable utilization of existing water sources. Over the next 20 to 30 years, threats to water security in the region will be further exacerbated by continuing transboundary disputes over access to water resources as described in a July 2020 memorandum by the U.S. National Intelligence Council on how water affects economic and political stability. Countries of particular concern include Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.

Water and Conflict: A Vicious Cycle

In MENA and Africa there is correlation between the spheres of influence of VEOs—groups that support and perpetrate ideologically-motivated violence—and areas of dry land or sparse vegetation.

Where extremist groups are active, the correlation between climate-based water stress and the onset of violence can be viewed in terms of a water conflict cycle which Marcus King (one of the authors of this article) described in a series of case studies of Syria and Iraq, Nigeria, and Somalia. In all three cases, water stressors such as increases in temperature, water scarcity, extreme weather, and depletion of groundwater led to detrimental local systemic outcomes. Climate shocks weaken state resiliency on multiple fronts. As a result of these stressors, people experience strains on rural livelihoods that accompany decreases in the productivity of agricultural systems. In each case, farmers responded through internal and external mass environmental migration, where in many cases they fell prey to violence perpetrated by VEOs.

Cross-border migration can also have cascading impacts on international security in a region as volatile as MENA. Somali migrants have fled to Yemen, another state embroiled in chaos, further complicating the delicate human security conditions in that country. Migrants from Syria, Iraq, Nigeria, and Somalia—all epicenters of water weaponization—continue on their way to Europe, and ethnonationalist political forces, by stoking fear of migrants, have exploited this humanitarian crisis to gain political power. The next stage of this vicious cycle is the loss of foreign investment and development assistance due to ongoing conflict which in turn hinders water infrastructure development. Domestic resources that could be used for this purpose are diverted to combat terrorism.

Water Weaponization

State and nonstate actors already at war have taken advantage of water stress to weaponize water as detailed in the three case studies featuring ISIS, Al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram. These VEOs have weaponized water in distinct ways depending on their capabilities and the characteristics of these ongoing internal wars. These cases prove that water can be used as a strategic or tactical weapon or as a means to terrorize, coerce, and subjugate local populations. For example, ISIS weaponized water on the strategic level by capturing the Mosul Dam on August 7, 2014. The group also wielded water as a tactical weapon against Iraqi forces, and collaterally flooded several villages. a In an article in the Washington Quarterly by one of the authors of this article, Marcus King, it’s argued that water weaponization was essential to the warfighting strategy of ISIS

Aside from outright weaponization, water has also been used by parties to conflict in MENA as a political lever. Mark Zeitoun coined the phrase hydro-hegemony to describe this behavior. As the upper riparian in the Tigris-Euphrates River System, hydro-hegemony places Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government in a position to leverage water resources against “Federal Iraq” which lies downstream. The construction of dams in Turkey and Iran, including in Ilisu, Daryan, and Sardash, are further decreasing water supplies.

As water becomes more polluted and scarce there is a perception in southern Iraq that the Kurds are overusing the waters of the Tigris and other rivers. This perception alone could be enough to destabilize relations, further eroding a frayed working relationship between Erbil and Baghdad. A treatment by Marcus King of the hydro-politics of Iraqi Kurdistan, including how climate change has impacted water resources, can be found in the volume Water and Conflict in the Middle East.

Today, as impacts of climate change are growing more intense, ushering in micro level water conflicts throughout Iraq, there is a sobering possibility that water stress will play into dissatisfaction with the national government manifested by popular support for a resurgence of ISIS in many areas.

Take the situation in the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Upstream damming has decreased water levels in the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers which converge in this area. This issue paired with decades of water mismanagement, climate-induced heatwaves, increased pollution, and seawater intrusion have limited access to electricity and clean water for drinking and sanitation leading to continued popular dissatisfaction and instability. Tensions exploded in 2018, as violent protests erupted after 100,000 fell sick from polluted waters. In January 2020, similar protests in Basra were met with violent reprisals by national authorities. Severe desertification in this area has caused farmers to abandon their livelihoods; some turning desperately towards theft for survival. In recent years, the worsening of desertification has correlated positively with increasing instances of crime such as armed robbery and human trafficking in Basra.

In 2020, the country faced scorching, record-high temperatures that reached 125.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In July 2020, government cuts to electricity left households throughout the country with few ways to combat unbearable temperatures. Again the Iraqis saw their upstream neighbors as the culprits while the increasingly delegitimized government in Baghdad did nothing. This raises the questions of what will happen as we approach another sweltering summer in Iraq.

Recommendations

Climate-driven environmental scarcity contributes to hydro-hegemonic behavior by nations and repeated, systematic, and unprecedented water weaponization by VEOs. Today, there is rising concern that Islamic State in West Africa is now extending its reach into Burkina Faso and that it may choose to leverage access to water over subjected populations to build allegiances, much as their brethren did in Syria and Iraq. Despite recent growth in water weaponization, we must not allow it to be normalized in modern warfare, and we must recognize and combat the role climate change has played in enabling such weaponization.

Overall, nations need to appreciate water as a potential tool for terror, and that it needs to be safeguarded as such. Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions prohibits the destruction of drinking-water installations, supplies, and irrigation works. Another agreement, the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD), prohibits action such as the deliberate destruction of infrastructure to kill civilians or to flood enemy positions. While climate has been addressed as a contributor to instability, there is a need for more robust legal remedies at the national and international level.

Development assistance from the United States and other multilateral actors that builds resilience to climate change will alleviate climate-induced water stress and reduce instability that could lead to violence across the MENA region. However, development assistance is a long-range strategy that is hard to implement during ongoing conflict. The Global Fragility Act, passed by Congress in 2019, provides funds to stabilize conflict-affected areas and prevent violence globally, including through development assistance, but it fails to mention climate change in any capacity as impacting state fragility.

The Biden Administration now has the opportunity to address this gap. In MENA, addressing water stress through development assistance can be a tool toward stability and conflict prevention and therefore form an integral part of counterinsurgency strategies against violent extremist organizations.

78,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Proposed Arizona copper mine threatens ocelot and jaguar - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-ocelot-copper-mine-20140811-story.html,"A lone male ocelot has become a symbol of the conflict between conservationists and federal officials over a proposal to build an open-pit copper mine in the Santa Rita Mountains, just south of Tucson.

The discovery of the ocelot in April prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reexamine its 2013 biological opinion that the Rosemont Copper mine would not unduly harm habitat for endangered species in the area, including the only known jaguar in the United States.

The ocelot, photographed with a remote-sensor camera operated by the University of Arizona, is among a handful of the secretive, highly territorial and federally endangered cats that are the first in half a century to prowl so far north of Mexico, scientists say.

There were no ocelots documented in the Santa Ritas when the agency issued its biological opinion on the mine project, proposed by Canadian firm Augusta Resource Corp. The project is to include a 955-acre open pit, a processing plant, transmission lines, new roads and tailings facilities.

Now the agency is weighing whether to anticipate an “incidental take” of an ocelot if the mine is built and trying to determine the company’s potential liability in the event the facility is linked to the death of one of the cats.

To answer those questions, the agency must first determine if the ocelot is a vagrant or a resident and if there are females in the thorny desert region, where federal protections and cattle ranchers are credited with protecting habitat for jaguars and ocelots.

The agency is also reconsidering the potential impacts of groundwater pumping by the mine on critical habitat for the endangered Chiricahua leopard frog and two fish, the Gila chub and Gila topminnow.

Conservationists led by the Center for Biological Diversity, which is based in Tucson, about 25 miles north of the Santa Ritas, have their minds made up.

“The science is clear,” said Randy Serraglio, a spokesman for the center. “The Rosemont mine cannot coexist with jaguars, ocelots and other endangered wildlife whose survival is on the line.

“Beyond that, we may be witnessing the results of the good work the USFWS has done by making it illegal to kill jaguars and ocelots,” he said. “Why would we want to turn our backs on that?”

The project was controversial even before the ocelot showed up.

In earlier drafts of the 2013 biological opinion, agency biologists concluded that the proposed mine would destroy thousands of acres of critical habitat for the jaguar on public land and sever access to the species’ range in northern Mexico.

Steve Spangle, manager of Fish and Wildlife’s ecological services field office in Arizona, rejected his scientists’ conclusion on the grounds that the adverse impacts they predicted were “too speculative” and not “highly probable” to result from the operation.

“The ‘incidental take permit’ we gave the company was based on our conclusion that the jaguar may simply shift its home range elsewhere,” Spangle said in an interview. “We never granted permission to physically harm or kill a jaguar.

“I’m as excited as anyone else that these animals are showing up out there,” he said.

In 2009, the Arizona Game and Fish Department euthanized the last then-known jaguar in the United States after capturing and outfitting him with a radio collar. An independent investigation later determined that the jaguar’s death was due in part to mismanagement by state officials.

393,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Drought drives Afghans off their land in hundreds of thousands as IFRC issues emergency humanitarian cash grant - Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre,https://www.climatecentre.org/news/1064/drought-drives-afghans-off-their-land-in-hundreds-of-thousands-as-ifrc-issues-emergency-humanitarian-cash-grant,"Drought drives Afghans off their land in hundreds of thousands as IFRC issues emergency humanitarian cash grant

The IFRC last week issued an emergency grant of humanitarian cash of just over US$ 250,000 to help the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) tackle the consequences of four consecutive years of drought and prepare for an expected increase in needs this winter.



Fourteen-thousand of the worst-affected people in north-west Herat and Badghis provinces will be helped by the from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund in an operation due to last at least until March.



It complements an existing ARCS plan to meet the immediate needs of 15,000 families for food, livelihoods, health, water and sanitation.



The ICRC last month welcomed the renewal of security guarantees in Afghanistan that will enable it and Movement partners to continue to reach people in need, including the many thousands who are internally displaced.



The IFRC on Thursday said a combination of below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures since last October had reduced snow, river levels and water tables, “negatively and irreversibly” affecting the most recent two harvests.



‘Increased needs’



It added: “Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for millions of Afghans in the north-western provinces,” where almost all the population depend on livestock and rain-fed crops.



The IFRC quoted UN country data as showing that the number of people displaced by drought in western Afghanistan and mostly forced to take refuge in the Herat and Badghis provincial capitals had reached 266,000 in September.



“Temperatures in these areas has already dropped close to zero degrees at night,” the International Federation says, and “the coming weeks will really be testing for drought-affected families with freezing conditions potentially resulting in [sickness and death].”



Households have started preparing to plant winter wheat, and because of the current forecast likelihood of El Niño – associated with wetter than average conditions in most of Afghanistan – the “area planted…is anticipated to be higher than last year,” the IFRC says. But it adds that “there remains a large spread of possible precipitation outcomes for the season.”



The latest sitrep from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, cited by the IFRC, says that amid the drought, “Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rain-fed staple [crop] performance, and will contribute to increased food-assistance needs as compared to recent years.”



The latest FEWSNET chart for October to January 2019 shows several areas of Badghis and Faryab provinces in red for emergency status.



Conflict-climate



Climate Centre Director Maarten van Aalst writes: Scientists say that for obvious reasons there is an acute shortage of data in Afghanistan that might help them determine whether any long-term climate-related trends exist in droughts or precipitation.



But some climate models indicate up to a 10 per cent decrease in precipitation in the future in parts of the country, and higher average temperatures would also mean less snow in winter and hence less water after the thaw.



In any case, the experience of the last few years in Afghanistan demonstrates that we need to raise our game on managing extremes and be prepared to deal with growing uncertainties.



The humanitarian system is rising to the challenge through, for example, the Afghan Red Crescent’s current drought-response plan that is flexible enough to adapt both to changing needs and security constraints.



It’s also worth noting that although this is not an FbF operation, the DREF was expanded earlier this year to include a window for forecast-based financing that could include droughts.



Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for millions of Afghans in north-western provinces. Here in the Ab Kamari district of Badghis province, the IFRC in September helped the Afghan Red Crescent Society set up a tented encampment for hundreds of people recently driven off their land by drought.

Everybody wants a swimming pool, at least until its thousands of gallons of chemical-laden water come splashing down through the ceiling of the parking garage it was precariously built above. W hich is exactly what was captured on video in Brazil this week.

The video, shared on DailyMotion, YouTube and Reddit, shows CCTV footage from the pool and the inside of the parking garage of a building in Vitória, Brazil. The moment that the floor of the swimming pool collapsed, around 10 p.m. on April 22, is clearly visible . I t appears nobody was injured.

In the video, we see the entire bottom of the pool fall out, all at once and pretty much in one giant piece, into the parking garage below. The cut to the garage shows the gushing water moving powerfully enough to shift the parked cars around in their spots.

Reddit user leandroas, who originally posted a copy of the video to the website, followed up his post with a comment claiming that the building, constructed in 2018, had to be evacuated following the incident. Th e building’s original construction company is said to be paying for the relocation, and t he poster claims residents of the building will be able to return April 27.

The pool was constructed to take advantage of a space above the entrance ramp from the street into the underground garage . Photos posted to Twitter show the aftermath of the pool collapse .

951,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Europe key to game's progress in Romania - Southland Times,https://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/sport/rugby-world-cup/5592017/Europe-key-to-games-progress-in-Romania,"POTENTIAL: Romania assistant coach and All Black World Cup title winner Steve McDowall hopes his team can be competitive in the group stages of the World Cup.

Romanian assistant coach Steve McDowall believes his adopted nation has the potential to improve on the world stage in the coming years if they can get more players into the top European leagues.

The former All Black prop, who was part of New Zealand's 1987 World Cup winning team, has been working with the Romanians since 2008 and said the game was slowly developing in the southeastern European country.

Eight members of the Romanian World Cup squad ply their trade professionally in France, with hardnosed prop Paulica Ion also playing abroad with London Irish in the English premiership.

McDowall said for Romania to become more of an international threat in the future they needed to have more players breaking through into the top-level European club competitions, where they would be exposed to tougher competition and a higher level of coaching.

""We've some good young guys. It's about getting them out to play in other teams in France and England at a better level. A lot of the older guys that have been playing in France are now basically finished. We've got two or three guys that are going into France, but we need to have a few more guys going back in there to maintain a certain level.""

McDowall also stressed there needed to be much more of a focus on rugby in the schools and said the country battled from a lack of grass fields to play the game on.

""Just about every school does not have fields. It's all bricks and concrete slabs around. If we can encourage schools to come in and be a part of a sport activity and slowly build the relationship, then hopefully we can grow from Rippa Rugby into the touch and obviously the sevens, leading into the 15s.""

Romania have qualified for every World Cup since 1987 but have never won more than one pool game at any of the tournaments.

The Oaks will be up against it at this year's spectacle, being grouped with England, Argentina, Scotland and Georgia. Their first three opponents should prove too difficult an obstacle to overcome but they will back themselves in their final pool game against the Georgians in Palmerston North.

McDowall said they were aiming to be competitive at the tournament and was confident they could surprise those sceptics who predict they will be the whipping boys of the group.

His contract with the Romanian Rugby Federation expires after the World Cup, but he said his wife and four children were adjusting well to their new life in the Romanian capital of Bucharest, and he was keen to stay on in the job.

McDowall, who played 46 tests for New Zealand between 1985 and 1992, said he would be keeping a close eye on the All Blacks during the World Cup and was optimistic they had the people and the ability to break their 24-year title drought. ""From what I've seen in the past, they do have the ability to go through and win. It's not going to be a given thing. They're going to have to work hard and hopefully the lessons from 2007 give them some direction at this World Cup.""

McDowall hoped the All Black coaching staff had learned from their rotation policy nightmare of 2007 where the team's leading players did not get enough game time in pool play.

He said it was imperative that they had decided on their first-choice starting lineup by the final pool play games so that they were hitting their straps come the knockout rounds.

""The pool is a stepping stone when you're gelling together and developing a strong attitude. You should be playing your No1 team in the last one or two pool games. That should be what's leading them through to the final.""",2011-09-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['romanian', 'rugby', 'cup', 'guys', 'game', 'team', 'france', 'europe', 'key', 'pool', 'progress', 'world', 'games', 'going', 'romania']",China,news article,English
1537,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt has genuine intention to reach an agreement on GERD before flood season: Sisi - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online,https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/408479/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-has-genuine-intention-to-reach-an-agreement-.aspx,"Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said on Sunday that Egypt has a genuine political intention to reach an agreement on the Ethiopian dam (GERD) at the earliest opportunity and before the flood season.

El-Sisi’s remarks came in a message handed by Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry to Congolese President and Chair of the African Union this year Félix Antoine Tshisekedi, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry read.

The Egyptian, Ethiopian, and Sudanese foreign and irrigation ministers are currently holding meetings in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa to resume talks on the GERD dispute under the auspices of the African Union.

Egypt and Sudan have warned of serious implications to their people and water interests if the second phase of filling the GERD is implemented without an agreement next July.

Ethiopia, however, reiterated its plans to complete the filling in that date whether or not an agreement is reached.

In his message, El-Sisi affirmed Egypt’s support to the efforts made by the Congolese president to help reach an agreement on the GERD.

El-Sisi said Egypt hopes that the current African Union-sponsored meetings succeed in launching an effective path for negotiations with the participation of international partners.

This effective path of negotiations should enable the three concerned countries to find solutions to the disputed technical and legal issues, with the aim of formulating a comprehensive agreement on the filling and operation of the dam, El-Sisi said in the message.

Egypt has welcomed and endorsed a Sudanese proposal in February to involve international partners as mediators in the talks. This includes a quartet of the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and the African Union. Ethiopia rejected the proposal, saying it is ready to talk only under the auspices of the African Union.

El-Sisi’s message hailed the Congolese efforts aiming to reach a balanced, legally binding agreement on the dam that would secure the interests of the three countries and enhance integrity and cooperation among them.

Sisi’s remarks come only a week after he took a hard line on the GERD dispute, warning that a compromise in Egypt’s water share was a “red line.” He pledged action if the country’s share of water from the Nile is jeopardised.

“No one can take a drop of water from Egypt,” El-Sisi said, warning of “inconceivable instability in the region that no one could imagine” if that is to happen.

Taking part in the Kinshasa talks, scheduled for 4-5 April, FM Shoukry affirmed that Egypt has maintained a genuine political will over the past 10 years to reach an agreement on the GERD.

He said this agreement should achieve Ethiopian developmental goals and, at the same time, protect the interests of Egypt and Sudan.

Shoukry “stressed the necessity that the Kinshasa meetings lead to launching a new round of negotiations that are characterised with efficiency and seriousness,” the foreign ministry said.

The FM also affirmed the need for international partners to attend the desired round of talks to guarantee their success.

These negotiations are considered the last chance that has to be exploited by the three countries in order to reach an agreement during the coming months and before the next flood season, Shoukry said.

Shoukry affirmed Egypt’s keenness to resolve the controversial issues that have obstructed previous rounds of negotiations.

Egypt’s Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel-Ati also attended the talks and the meeting with the Congolese president.

Shoukry and Abdel-Ati reviewed with President Tshisekedi Egypt’s efforts over the last decade to reach an agreement on the GERD.

Shoukry affirmed that Egypt has consistently introduced solutions and proposals on the issue in a way that addresses Ethiopian concerns.

These solutions and proposals were meant to guarantee the achievement of Ethiopian developmental goals and also protect the interests of the downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan, Shoukry added.

The success of the current efforts to settle the GERD issue and avoid the aggravation of the situation in a region already suffering from turmoil and instability, however, requires a political will from all parties to reach a just agreement, Shoukry said.

Tshisekedi on Sunday said the goal of the Kinshasa talks is to revive the negotiation process among the three countries on the GERD, Al-Arabiya reported.

He affirmed the necessity to reach solutions to the issue within the framework of the African Union.

Tshisekedi also called for taking into account the humanitarian dimension of the GERD issue and working to achieve the interests of the three countries’ peoples.

14,DR-2014-000109-CHN,California lawmakers considering historic shift in groundwater policy - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-water-20140810-story.html,"As California continues to endure a calamitous lack of water from the sky, the state could, for the first time, start to regulate water drawn from the ground.

Groundwater regulation has been politically poisonous since the state’s founding. But lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration are hoping to capitalize on the current parched conditions, and cautious cooperation from once-resistant interest groups, to pass a plan for a groundwater management system by the end of the month.

“This falls under the category of: Never let a crisis go to waste,” said Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento), an author of the legislation.

The drought has propelled water policy to the top of the Legislature’s agenda in the final month of its session. Brown and lawmakers are also negotiating revisions to a water bond measure scheduled for the November ballot. They’re at odds over how much borrowing voters should be asked to approve to pay for such projects as storage and groundwater cleanup.

Meanwhile, the drought’s effects have been buffered somewhat by groundwater reserves.

A study released last month by UC Davis found the state’s economy has taken a $2.2-billion hit this year because of the drought — costs that would have been much higher except for increased pumping of groundwater. Researchers said increased reliance on underground reserves made up for as much as 75% of the water lost from surface sources.

There are no statewide rules on how much water can be taken from the ground. Since the Gold Rush days, groundwater has been considered a property right; landowners are entitled to what’s beneath them.

As the availability of water from lakes and rivers has become more inconsistent because of drought or environmental regulation, groundwater extraction has increased. That has caused more water to be removed from some underground basins, especially in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, than is being replaced.

“What we’re doing with groundwater is an equivalent to deficit spending,” said Lester Snow, director of the nonprofit group California Water Foundation and a former state secretary for natural resources. “Something bad is going to happen” in the long run, he said.

Some water districts have started managing underground sources on their own; others have become regulated after long and costly court battles. But some key basins remain unregulated, and there are substantial gaps in information about the state’s groundwater supply.

The Department of Water Resources estimates the state’s wells number from 1 million to 2 million — a significant variance.

“That shows you how out of whack the system is,” said Jay Ziegler, director of policy of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group.

The legislative proposal contained in two identical bills would direct local agencies to create plans by 2020 for managing their groundwater. The plans could be customized to fit local needs, and the state could step in to enforce them if local agencies aren’t up to the task.

“We do recognize that local management is by far preferable,” said state Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), an author of one of the bills.

The governor’s office has helped draft the proposal, buoying its prospects. If the legislation passes, it would mark a monumental shift for California, the only Western state that does not regulate groundwater.

“California hasn’t attempted to change water law this dramatically in 100 years,” said Dave Puglia, a senior vice president of Western Growers Assn., an agricultural industry group.

Advertisement

Past efforts to enact statewide groundwater management have fizzled. Resistance remains, particularly among agricultural interests that are still deeply suspicious of state interference. That has become more pronounced as farmers have increasingly relied on groundwater for their crops.

Among other concerns, the agriculture interests, which hold substantial sway in the Capitol, fear that a new regulatory system could affect property values.

“If the legislation enacted creates even a perception of a loss of access to the groundwater that was accessible before, my land value goes down,” Puglia said.

The farming group wants limitations on when and how forcefully the state could intervene to enact local plans.

Advertisement

It is significant that farm groups are even negotiating, the legislation’s supporters say. And other key interests have changed their stance on state involvement.

“Ten years ago, we were for local control [of groundwater resources] no matter what,” said Tim Quinn, executive director of the Assn. of California Water Districts. “Now, we’re for local control — so long as the locals are managing responsibly.”

173,Drought Sri Lanka,Somalia drought forces children out of school - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/3/4/somalia-drought-forces-children-out-of-school,"One-third of children in Somalia could drop out of school as the country is threatened with famine.

A third of children in Somalia’s drought-affected areas are at risk of dropping out of school, the UN says, as a shortage of food and water has left more than 6.2 million people needing urgent help.

The drought is threatening the lives of millions and almost three million are going hungry. Three million children in the country are missing school and more than 100,000 could join them, according to the UN.

On Tuesday, Somalia’s newly elected President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed declared a “national disaster” due to the drought.

The Horn of Africa nation is one of three countries – along with Yemen and Nigeria – that the aid agencies say are on the verge of famine.

The desperate search for water and food proving particularly difficult for children.

“I’d love to go back to school, but I’ve been forced to leave because I’m the eldest child in my family and I need to work at home,” Sadia Omar, a former student, told Al Jazeera.

“I fetch water and grass for the animals, but now because of the drought there is more work.”

Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Dollow in southern Somalia, said severe drought was forcing families to migrate in search of help.

“The number of children at this school [in the Dhuma Dhuma area] has halved in just three months,” she said.

“Families here live off their livestock and they’re doing all they can to keep their animals alive. If that means keeping their children out of school to look after them, many families are prepared to make the sacrifice.”

On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Somalia was at risk of its third famine in 25 years. The last one, in 2011, killed almost 260,000 people.

The drought has led to a spread of acute watery diarrhoea, cholera and measles and nearly 5.5 million people are at risk of contracting waterborne diseases.

According to the WHO, more than 363,000 acutely malnourished children and 70,000 severely malnourished children need urgent, life-saving support.

“If the drought continues, these children will continue missing school and it will also impact their future learning and they won’t come back,” Abdihakim Ahmed, the headteacher at the school in Dhuma Dhuma, said.",2017-03-04 08:00:00+00:00,"['million', 'school', 'water', 'urgent', 'children', 'drought', 'food', 'forces', 'somalia', 'dhuma', 'risk']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

People in many more districts are facing ruin because of the unprecedented drought, while farmer groups are insisting that the government pay Rs 50,000 for every acre destroyed. Farmers charge that government incompetence and corruption has made the situation worse.

Some estimates suggest that at least a million Sri Lankans are desperate.

Government officials say money has been made available to provide drinking water and rice is being imported.

Latest data from the Disaster Management Ministry show 845,343 people in 16 districts are suffering in the drought. In the Western Province alone, with a 298,848 are badly affected.

Gampaha and Kalutara are the worst affected. In Gampaha, 101,516 have been identified as victims, while in Kalutara there are 197,332.

Gampaha, Assistant District Secretary, Prasad Indika, said out of 13 divisional secretariat areas, eight have been badly affected.

“The situation is terrible. Dompe was added recently to the list. The conditions are becoming worse,” he said.

In the district, 252 water tanks have been placed for the collective use of the public. These tanks are being filled by using 9 water tankers operated under the District Secretariat with the assistance of Pradeshiya Sabhas.

“It is challenging to supply water to 23,845 families with only nine water tankers. We have requested a few more from the army. If the situation worsens we might have to seek the support of non-government organisations as well,” he said.

The Attanagalu Oya flowing across the district is in danger of drying out, said T D Wijesuriya, divisional irrigation engineer in the Gampaha district.

“The meter reading of the Attanagalu Oya was -0.22 m (according to a reference scale) on Friday. This is a severe stage.’’

He warned of a possible severe drinking water shortage by mid-March. “Water pumped from the Attanagalu Oya was distributed to mitigate the drinking water scarcity. If this also dries up, it will be serious,” he said.

In the Northern Province people are desperate. According to the Disaster Management Centre, 14 divisional secretariat areas have been affected in Jaffna district. Relief operations are not functioning in certain parts of the province.

The Disaster management officer of the Polonnaruwa district, Upul Nanayakkara said that at the moment the recent rains have helped to ease the drinking water shortage.

“All the paddy lands have been cultivated except in Kawudulla and Girithale. Discussions are underway with the Ministry of Agriculture to pay compensation to the farmers in the two areas,” he said.

However, other sources said 50,000 acres of paddy lands out of 150,000 acres that are usually cultivated have been abandoned.

The Director General of the National Disaster Relief Service Centre, Chaminda Pathiraja, said: “The government has granted Rs 50 million through the Treasury to provide drinking water facilities. Another fleet of 100 tractor bowsers and more 1,000 litre water tanks will be bought. The government has provided funds for overtime payments, fuel, hire more bowsers and to buy water.’’

Pathiraja also said 25 metric tonnes of rice from Pakistan will be imported and another 5,000 metric tonnes will be shipped from Indonesia. These would be available in the market by March.

“Officials are gathering data about drought affected farmers to grant relief. Discussions are underway to provide compensation to the farmers. There are proposals to employ them in development projects but a final decision has not been made,” he said.

He said that non-government organisations could assist and all foreign donations could be coordinated via the External Affairs Ministry.

The Department of Meteorology said although light rain can be expected from time to time it wouldn’t be enough to ease drought conditions.

“On 18 and 19 evening showers may occur in most parts of the island except in the Northern Province. In mid March a change in the dry weather will start to occur and by May the drought will totally be over,” predicted duty meteorologist Srimal Herath.

The Assistant Commissioner of the Agrarian Services Department, M L M Sandamali, said the damage to paddy lands is being estimated to calculate compensation.

“A significant decline in the yield is visible in cultivations during this harvesting period. We were able to dig irrigation wells and to pump underground water with the help of the irrigation department for cultivation. In Gampaha district we recovered 3,600 hectares of paddy this way,” she said.

The national organizer of the All Ceylon Farmers Federation, Namal Karunarathna, charged that mismanagement and government corruption were responsible for the crisis. “The government says that the reason for this drought is the low rainfall last year. That’s not the truth. Last year also we received the usual rainfall but the there was a slight difference between the time periods. The problem is the inability to store that.”

He also said the Maha cultivation has failed for the first time in four decades.

“The officials didn’t release water properly last year. The harvest was low as a result. The Padaviya Tank had not been renovated since 1950s,” he said.

Renovations and de-silting of tanks should be done and new tanks should also be built. “The so-called experts have no idea about the technology in irrigation systems as our ancestors had. For example, the Minneriya tank had 62 small tanks known as kulu wewa to control the water flow in the main tank,’’ Karunarathna said.

“The farmers have lost their livelihood completely. Their paddy, vegetable, and corn cultivation have been devastated. We demand the government pay Rs 50,000 for every acre of damaged cultivation and to pay other cultivations according to the damage,” he stressed. “The government cannot refuse that. This is the first compensation farmers have demanded in 40 years for a Maha season.”

UN WFP to help overcome drought related hardshipThe UN World Food Programme (WFP) has come forward to assist Sri Lanka to overcome difficulties faced by the public due to the severe drought prevalent islandwide.The WFP will conduct this programme in partnership with the ministries, non-government organisations and the private sector. As per the requests made by the Ministry of Disaster Management and the External Resources Dept, for drought related support, WFP’s technical experts conducted a preliminary drought assessment and a report submitted to a ministerial Sub Cabinet meeting on the drought. In February, the WFP and the Government will lead a joint emergency assessment of the impact of the drought on household food security and livelihoods. Meanwhile, the WFP is assisting 14,000 farming families in the Mahaweli River Basin, while 72 small tanks will be rehabilitated this year under a Climate Change Adaptation Project. The WFP has also highlighted the food and nutrition insecurity due to the increased frequency of natural disasters such as floods and droughts. The WFP noted that the heavy rains received in late January did irreversible damage to the Maha season crops, which resulted in the 2017 harvest being considered the worst in the last decade.",2017-02-19 08:00:00+00:00,"['droughtbungling', 'tanks', 'million', 'farmers', 'graftcries', 'wfp', 'drinking', 'water', 'pay', 'drought', 'rise', 'desperate', 'district', 'disaster', 'paddy']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
474,DR-2021-000054-SOM,"Somalia Emergency Response and Preparedness Plan 2021 - Conflict, Floods, Drought (April 2021) - Somalia - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-emergency-response-and-preparedness-plan-2021-conflict-floods-drought-april,"Strategic Summary

Cyclical patterns of erratic weather conditions, climatic causes of displacement, political instability and a rise in conflict — including due to the highly contentious election process and disputes over natural resources (land, water, pasture) — have deepened Somalia’s protection crisis.

Water challenges in Somalia oscillate between water shortages and drought-like conditions, and flash floods and river breakages. As communities struggle to cope with the impact of COVID-19 and the desert locust infestation in a context of protracted armed conflict, insecurity and political instability, pre-drought conditions seen across various parts of the country add an additional layer of complexity, further driving communities to adopt negative coping mechanisms.

In the first quarter of 2021, more than 34 districts in Somalia were already facing devastating water shortages, over 95,000 Somalis were displaced by droughtlike conditions since December 2020, and at least 3.4 million people were projected to be affected by drought or drought-like conditions by year end, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced due to droughtlike conditions and dry season.

The poor weather patterns are expected to continue due to La Niña conditions and a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall with below-average Gu rainfall season forecast from April to June. The impact of drought and livelihoods situation will be exacerbated by the continuation of the desert locust infestation which is forecast to continue spreading following reports of newly formed immature swarms breeding in the northern parts of the country. Progressively, widespread food security Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected through September 2021.

Efforts therefore need to be bolstered to provide communities access to sustainable and climate-resilient water services. This means investing in short, medium and long-term solutions that withstand climate shocks. To address the immediate lifesaving needs of affected populations, urgent and collective action is required to mitigate the worse impacts of the various shocks. Complementary to the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan, the Emergency Response and Preparedness (ERP) outlines detailed State-level response and preparedness contingency plans to operationalize and optimize the speed and volume of critical assistance delivered immediately after the trigger of an identified slow-onset or sudden-onset humanitarian of three key shocks: drought, conflict and flooding at both the State and Federal level.",2021-05-17 07:00:00+00:00,"['droughtlike', 'conflict', 'floods', 'water', 'weather', 'response', 'conditions', 'plan', 'emergency', 'drought', 'shocks', 'preparedness', 'expected', 'communities', '2021', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English
504,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia is facing another food crisis: here's why — and what can be done to stop the cycle - MinnPost,https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2021/05/somalia-is-facing-another-food-crisis-heres-why-and-what-can-be-done-to-stop-the-cycle/,"Since the fall of Siad Barre’s regime in 1991, which led to a prolonged period of civil unrest, Somalia has been in a near-constant state of food insecurity. It also suffered two famines – in 1992 and 2011.

Every year, between April and May (when food is planted and not harvested), aid agencies make dire predictions about the impending doom of the upcoming growing season and to appeal for funds to support increased food aid. This year, Save the Children announced that millions of Somalis won’t have enough food to eat as crop and vegetable production is expected to drop by 75%-80%. And the UN’s 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan seeks $1.09 billion to provide “life-saving assistance” across Somalia.

As agricultural experts working in Somalia for the last 35 years we have done extensive research into food production. We have been involved in developing agricultural policies aimed at finding solutions to the country’s stagnant cereal production with an eye on reducing food insecurity in the country.

Article continues after advertisement

As part of our work we investigated historic trends over the last 60 years in domestic cereal production, cereal imports, and food aid in Somalia. We found that there’s been a precipitous decrease in the production of key cereals – maize and sorghum – over time, falling from a high of 91 kg per capita in 1972 to just 30 kg per capita in 2012. This is due to a combination of stagnant crop production and a rapidly increasing population. Conflict, corruption and bad governance have made matters worse.

Once almost cereal independent, the production decline has created a dependence on food aid and imports – over 50% of cereal consumed is imported. This is hugely problematic: A majority of Somalis live below the poverty level and cannot afford to pay for food; relying on imports leaves them vulnerable to markets.

Improving domestic cereal production in Somalia should be part of any future food security strategy for the country. The implementation of simple agricultural best management practices – such as fertilizer application and timely planting and weeding – can increase cereal production in the country.

In practical terms this means many farmers could increase production, if there were increased incentives to do so. Currently, food aid and imports can stifle domestic production because farmers have little incentive to put in the extra effort to produce more than that which they consume.

Cereal crops

Sorghum and maize are the predominant cereal crops grown in Somalia and historically, these two crops have provided a sizeble portion of total caloric intake of the Somali diet. Livestock is also a key local consumption commodity for household food security.

Sorghum production is mainly done by smallholder farmers and is carried out in dryland areas. Sorghum is more drought tolerant than maize and is grown predominantly in the Bay Region, south-central Somalia between the Juba and Shebelle rivers, Somalia’s largest rivers.

Maize is typically grown on irrigated land, often by small- and medium-sized farmers. These landholders often employ family labour to manage their land. The major maize growing areas are along the Shebelle and Juba rivers.

Somali cereal production levels have not increased in the last 60 years. In fact, from 1972 to 2012 cereal production per capita decreased by 66%.

Article continues after advertisement

There are a few factors that have contributed to this.

The first is poor yields. Average yield of both sorghum (300 to 500 kg/ha) and maize (900 to 1200 kg/ha) is low compared with most, about 20% of the average yield in developed countries.

Average yields are low because farmers typically don’t have access to the necessary agricultural inputs, for example, quality seeds and fertilizer. They also lack access to farm machinery, such as planters, fertilizer applicators, sprayers and harvesting equipment. In addition, there are no research and extension services in the country to help farmers make an informed decision.

Food shortages can also be due to the weather, such as flooding or drought. Higher frequencies and severity of drought events observed in recent years could make things worse.

Limited rainfall can negatively impact sorghum production. In recent years drought frequency is once every three years. Flooding can negatively impact irrigated maize production. Though localized, the country is experiencing flooding every two to three years.

Because the Shebelle and Juba rivers originate in high rainfall areas of Ethiopia, rains there can cause subsequent flooding in Somalia while drought conditions exist during the same growing season.

Conflict and poor governance

Another major reason for food insecurity in the country remains conflict, corruption and bad governance.

Civil unrest, since the early 1990s, is directly related to a deterioration of irrigation infrastructure. It has reduced the access that farmers may have to markets and the country lacks an agricultural regulatory framework, affecting food production and marketing.

Article continues after advertisement

The unrest has also resulted in the displacement of many farmers – there are about to 2.6 million internally displaced people in Somalia. This reduces the harvest of both crops.

In addition, illegal taxation on agricultural produce while it’s being transported to market is commonplace, both by government officials and rebel groups. This acts as a disincentive to farmers to produce crops.

Food insecurity

The fact that Somalia has not improved crop production has led to food insecurity. There are a few things that can be done to change this.

First, Somalia should improve the way in which production data are reported. Somalia has two growing seasons each year: the Gu from April through May and the shorter Deyr from October into November. However, data is reported annually. This gives an incomplete view of how drastically different the seasons can be and causes confusion on production area data.

Article continues after advertisement

It’s also imperative that production and reliability increase. This can be done by adopting relatively simple agricultural management techniques that have been well-researched and recognized as important yield factors in sub-Saharan Africa.

For example, the country could:

Introduce proper land and irrigation management techniques.

Improve transportation infrastructure and market development.

Work on canal restoration and land leveling for improved irrigation efficiency.

Introduce organic and mineral fertilizers, train farmers on their importance and develop policies on fertilizer importation.

Instigate land ownership laws, giving farmers an incentive to improving agricultural infrastructure.

Encourage timely weeding and a denser planting population for increased yields.

Better monitor food aid distribution and encourage more aid to be domestically produced. This would enhance agricultural capabilities within Somalia.

Enhance security in agricultural areas. This would free up donor funds that currently go to providing security of humanitarian efforts.

Encourage cropping and intercropping with legumes such as cowpea and mungbean. While this will not enhance yield of the cereal crop, it spreads risk and adds to diversity in the diet.

In terms of political instability, unfortunately current tensions prevent policymakers from focusing on issues of food security. This is a big hurdle that needs to be overcome.

But there are steps policymakers can still take to move Somalia from emergency or humanitarian aid toward development aid. This would provide much-needed jobs, particularly for the youth (almost 70% of the population) – and strengthen the agricultural sector to help enable Somalia to be more food secure.

In 1991, Hossein Farzin published an article titled “Food Aid: Positive or Negative Economic Effects in Somalis?” It would seem now – 30 years later – we should have a better answer to that question.

2457,FL-2017-000067-BRA,Lawsuit Against BHP over Brazil Dam Collapse Fails on Appeal in English Court - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2021/03/25/606967.htm,"LONDON – A 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group said on Wednesday it had failed to resurrect a 5.0 billion pound ($6.9 billion) English lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP over a devastating 2015 dam failure.

The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be “irredeemably unmanageable” if allowed to proceed.

Related: Brazilian Dam Claimants to Take BHP Class Action to English Court of Appeal

Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was “a sad day for the English justice system” after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.

The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.

The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.

The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel.”

Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent “a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing.”

“We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,” he said.

BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing “the right thing” for victims.

BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.

BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.

A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.

In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.

Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

565,Drought Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka's drought, failure to raise power capacity force nationwide power cuts - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-power-idUSKCN1R61WG,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka’s state-run power firm has imposed daily power cuts for the first time in more than two years as a drought has slashed hydro-power output, highlighting the government’s failure to build new power plants, officials said on Monday.

Slideshow ( 3 images )

The drought has cut the hydro-power generation in half to 15 percent of the nation’s total electricity production as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) seeks to save water for household and irrigation requirements, the firm said.

That has resulted in a four-hour rolling power cut on weekdays, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. (0300-1630 GMT), that began without notice on Friday and was then announced on a scheduled basis for Monday. The four-hour daily cuts hit different places at different times.

If the power cuts are extended for any length of time they could hurt Sri Lanka’s already weak economy. Its GDP growth slowed to just 3.2 percent in 2018, the lowest in 17 years.

Sri Lanka’s peak demand is 2,400 MW and the country is generating 1,950 MW at the moment, CEB officials said.

“We have to impose power cuts to bridge the shortage,” Saumya Kumarawadu, head of the CEB Engineers Union, told Reuters. “The main reason for the power cut is the government’s failure in implementing the planned power plants,” he added.

Officials from the Power and Energy Ministry were not immediately available for comment on the power cuts.

Health Ministry officials said key hospitals in the country had emergency power backup.

In an indication of how severe the situation has become, a Power and Energy Ministry official said the government had on Friday started trying to produce artificial rain with the help of Thailand’s Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation - so far only a pilot project.

The power cuts come after delays in power plant projects.

In 2016, the government canceled a 500 MW coal power plant through a joint venture between CEB and India’s National Thermal Power Corporation in the eastern port district of Trincomalee, citing environmental pollution. That coal power plant was originally due to start producing later this year.

A 300 MW liquefied natural gas plant (LNG), which was to be started in January this year, has been held up for more than two years due to a court battle between local firm Lakdhanavi and a joint venture between China’s GCL and a Sri Lankan firm.

Lakdhanavi had filed a legal case against the Power and Energy Ministry in 2017 for awarding the LNG tender to the joint venture for $307 million against its bid of $175 million.

Sri Lanka has total electricity generating capacity of 40 GWH, as it mainly relies on thermal power, including a Chinese built coal power plant, which account for 45 percent of its supply.",2019-03-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['venture', 'nationwide', 'cuts', 'ministry', 'raise', 'sri', 'plant', 'mw', 'lankas', 'drought', 'ceb', 'power', 'officials', 'force', 'failure', 'capacity']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
950,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Batteries that Charge Themselves with Mechanical Energy - CleanTechnica,https://cleantechnica.com/2011/08/31/batteries-that-charge-themselves-with-mechanical-energy/,"MicroGen Systems has been working on electricity-generating chips designed to power wireless sensors like those used to monitor tire pressure and environmental conditions.

These chips convert the mechanical energy of vibrations into electricity, which is then used to charge a small battery, which in turn powers the sensors.

If the chips are capable of generating adequate electrical energy, then they could mostly (or maybe even completely) eliminate the need to replace the batteries.

The core of MicroGen’s chips is a 1 cm2 array of silicon cantilevers that oscillate when the chip is jostled. At the base of the cantilevers is a bit of piezoelectric material: when it’s strained by vibrations, it produces a voltage that can be used to generate electrical current. Voltage is what causes current to flow.

The array of cantilevers is mounted on top of a postage-stamp-sized, thin-film battery that it charges. The current passes from the piezoelectric array through an electrical device that converts the current to an appropriate DC current that is suitable for charging the battery. When the chip is shaken by the vibrations of a rotating tire, for example, it can produce about 200 microwatts of power.

An efficient vibration-energy-harvesting device has the potential to be very beneficial because there are so many vibrating devices, such as mechanical machines, in general, including automobiles, generators, engines in general, and fans, as well as humans walking, arm and hand movements, and much more.

David Culler, chair of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley said: “If you can get it down to a small size, 200 microwatts is potentially quite useful.”

Robert Andosca, the founder and president of MicroGen Systems, said that what sets this technology apart from other piezoelectric generators is the fact that it is made of a non-toxic material known as PZT.

200 microwatts of power might not be much, but if it is small enough, it could be very beneficial to tiny sensors that need to be integrated into small places.

1019,Drought Sri Lanka,5 Ways China Could Become a Democracy – The Diplomat - the Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2013/02/5-ways-china-could-become-a-democracy/,"Advertisement

Speculating about China’s possible political futures is an intellectual activity that intrigues some and puzzles many. The conventional wisdom is that the entrenched Chinese Communist Party (CCP), so determined to defend and perpetuate its political monopoly, has the means to survive for an extended period (though not forever). A minority view, however, holds that the CCP’s days are numbered. In fact, a transition to democracy in China in the next 10 to 15 years is a high probability event. What stands behind this optimistic view about China’s democratic future is accumulated international and historical experience in democratic transitions (roughly 80 countries have made the transition from authoritarian rule to varying forms and degrees of democracy in the past 40 years) and decades of social science research that has yielded important insights into the dynamics of democratic transition and authoritarian decay (the two closely linked processes).

To be sure, those believing that China’s one-party regime still has enough resilience to endure decades of rule can point to the CCP’s proven and enormous capacity for repression (the most critical factor in the survival of autocracies), its ability to adapt to socioeconomic changes (although the degree of its adaptability is a subject of scholarly contention), and its track record of delivering economic improvement as a source of legitimacy.

To this list of reasons why the Chinese people should resign themselves to decades of one-party rule will be a set of factors singled out by proponents of the theory of predictable regime change in China. Among many of the causes of the decline and collapse of authoritarian rule, two stand out.

First, there is the logic of authoritarian decay. One-party regimes, however sophisticated, suffer from organizational ageing and decay. Leaders get progressively weaker (in terms of capabilities and ideological commitment); such regimes tend to attract careerists and opportunists who view their role in the regime from the perspective of an investor: they want to maximize their returns from their contribution to the regime’s maintenance and survival. The result is escalating corruption, deteriorating governance, and growing alienation of the masses. Empirically, the organizational decay of one-party regime can be measured by the limited longevity of such regimes. To date, the record longevity of a one-party regime is 74 years (held by the former Communist Party of the Soviet Union). One-party regimes in Mexico and Taiwan remained in power for 71 and 73 years respectively (although in the case of Taiwan, the accounting is complicated by the Kuomintang’s military defeat on the mainland). Moreover, all of the three longest-ruling one-party regimes began to experience system-threatening crisis roughly a decade before they exited political power. If the same historical experience should be repeated in China, where the Communist Party has ruled for 63 years, we may reasonably speculate that the probability of a regime transition is both real and high in the coming 10-15 years, when the CCP will reach the upper-limit of the longevity of one-party regimes.

Second, the effects of socioeconomic change –rising literacy, income, and urbanization rates, along with the improvement of communications technologies — greatly reduce the costs of collective action, de-legitimize autocratic rule, and foster demands for greater democracy. As a result, authoritarian regimes, which have a relatively easy time ruling poor and agrarian societies, find it increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible to maintain their rule once socioeconomic development reaches a certain level. Statistical analysis shows that authoritarian regimes become progressively more unstable (and democratic transitions more likely) once income rises above $1,000 (PPP) per capita. When per capita income goes above $4,000 (PPP), the likelihood of democratic transitions increases more dramatically. Few authoritarian regimes, unless they rule in oil-producing countries, can survive once per capita income hits more than $6,000 (PPP). If we apply this observation and take into account the probable effect of inflation (although the above PPP figures were calculated in constant terms), we will find that China is well into this “zone of democratic transition” because its per capita income is around $9,100 (PPP) today, comparable to the income level of South Korea and Taiwan in the mid-1980s on the eve of their democratic transitions. In another 10-15 years, its per capita income could exceed $15,000 and its urbanization rate will have risen to 60-65 percent. If the CCP has such a tough time today (in terms of deploying its manpower and financial resources) to maintain its rule, just imagine how impossible the task will become in 10-15 years’ time.

If this analysis is convincing enough for us to entertain the strong possibility of a democratic transition in China in the coming 10-15 years, the more interesting follow-up question is definitely “how will such a transition happen?”

Again, based on the rich experience of democratic transitions since the 1970s, there are five ways China could become democratic:

“Happy ending” would be the most preferable mode of democratic transition for China. Typically, a peaceful exit from power managed by the ruling elites of the old regime goes through several stages. It starts with the emergence of a legitimacy crisis, which may be caused by many factors (such as poor economic performance, military defeat, rising popular resistance, unbearable costs of repression, and endemic corruption). Recognition of such a crisis convinces some leaders of the regime that the days of authoritarian rule are numbered and they should start managing a graceful withdrawal from power. If such leaders gain political dominance inside the regime, they start a process of liberalization by freeing the media and loosening control over civil society. Then they negotiate with opposition leaders to set the rules of the post-transition political system. Most critically, such negotiations center on the protection of the ruling elites of the old regime who have committed human rights abuses and the preservation of the privileges of the state institutions that have supported the old regime (such as the military and the secret police). Once such negotiations are concluded, elections are held. In most cases (Taiwan and Spain being the exceptions), parties representing the old regime lose such elections, thus ushering in a new democratic era. At the moment, the transition in Burma is unfolding according to this script.

But for China, the probability of such a happy ending hinges on, among other things, whether the ruling elites start reform before the old regime suffers irreparable loss of legitimacy. The historical record of peaceful transition from post-totalitarian regimes is abysmal mainly because such regimes resist reform until it is too late. Successful cases of “happy ending” transitions, such as those in Taiwan, Mexico, and Brazil, took place because the old regime still maintained sufficient political strength and some degree of support from key social groups. So the sooner the ruling elites start this process, the greater their chances of success. The paradox, however, is that regimes that are strong enough are unwilling to reform and regimes that are weak cannot reform. In the Chinese case, the odds of a soft landing are likely to be determined by what China’s new leadership does in the coming five years because the window of opportunity for a political soft landing will not remain open forever.

“Gorby comes to China” is a variation of the “happy ending” scenario with a nasty twist. In such a scenario, China’s leadership misses the historic opportunity to start the reform now. But in the coming decade, a convergence of unfavorable economic, social, and political trends (such as falling economic growth due to demographic ageing, environmental decay, crony-capitalism, inequality, corruption and rising social unrest) finally forces the regime to face reality. Hardliners are discredited and replaced by reformers who, like Gorbachev, start a Chinese version of glasnost and perestroika. But the regime by that time has lost total credibility and political support from key social groups. Liberalization triggers mass political mobilization and radicalism. Members of the old regime start to defect – either to the opposition or their safe havens in Southern California or Switzerland. Amid political chaos, the regime suffers another internal split, similar to that between Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev, with the rise of a radical democratizer replacing a moderate reformer. With their enormous popular support, the dominant political opposition, including many defectors from the old regime, refuses to offer concessions to the Communist Party since it is now literally in no position to negotiate. The party’s rule collapses, either as a result of elections that boot its loyalists out of power or spontaneous seizure of power by the opposition.

Should such a scenario occur in China, it would be the most ironic. For the last twenty years, the Communist Party has tried everything to avert a Soviet-style collapse. If the “Gorby scenario” is the one that brings democracy to China, it means the party has obviously learned the wrong lesson from the Soviet collapse.

“Tiananmen redux” is a third possibility. Such a scenario can unfold when the party continues to resist reform even amid signs of political radicalization and polarization in society. The same factors that contribute to the “Gorby scenario” will be at play here, except that the trigger of the collapse is not a belated move toward liberalization by reformers inside the regime, but by an unanticipated mass revolt that mobilizes a wide range of social groups nationwide, as happened during Tiananmen in 1989. The manifestations of such a political revolution will be identical with those seen in the heady days of the pro-democracy Tiananmen protest and the “Jasmine Revolution” in the Middle East. In the Chinese case, “Tiananmen redux” produces a different political outcome mainly because the China military refuses to intervene again to save the party (in most cases of crisis-induced transitions since the 1970s, the military abandoned the autocratic rulers at the most critical moment).

“Financial meltdown” – our fourth scenario – can initiate a democratic transition in China in the same way the East Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 led to the collapse of Suharto in Indonesia. The Chinese bank-based financial system shares many characteristics with the Suharto-era Indonesian banking system: politicization, cronyism, corruption, poor regulation, and weak risk management. It is a well-known fact today that the Chinese financial system has accumulated huge non-performing loans and may be technically insolvent if these loans are recognized. In addition, off-balance sheet activities through the shadow-banking system have mushroomed in recent years, adding more risks to financial stability. As China’s capacity to maintain capital control erodes because of the proliferation of methods to move money in and out of China, the probability of a financial meltdown increases further. To make matters worse, premature capital account liberalization by China could facilitate capital flight in times of a systemic financial crisis. Should China’s financial sector suffer a meltdown, the economy would grind to a halt and social unrest could become uncontrollable. If the security forces fail to restore order and the military refuse to bail out the party, the party could lose power amid chaos. The probability of a collapse induced by a financial meltdown alone is relatively low. But even if the party should survive the immediate aftermath of a financial meltdown, the economic toll exacted on China will most likely damage its economic performance to such an extent as to generate knock-on effects that eventually delegitimize the party’s authority.

“Environmental collapse” is our last regime change scenario. Given the salience of environmental decay in China these days, the probability of a regime change induced by environmental collapse is not trivial. The feed-back loop linking environmental collapse to regime change is complicated but not impossible to conceive. Obviously, the economic costs of environmental collapse will be substantial, in terms of healthcare, lost productivity, water shortage, and physical damages.Growth could stall, undermining the CCP’s legitimacy and control. Environmental collapse in China has already started to alienate the urban middle-class from the regime and triggered growing social protest. Environmental activism can become a political force linking different social groups together in a common cause against a one-party regime seen as insensitive, unresponsive, and incompetent on environmental issues. The severe degradation of the environment in China also means that the probability of a catastrophic environmental disaster – a massive toxic spill, record drought, or extended period of poisonous smog– could trigger a mass protest incident that opens the door for the rapid political mobilization of the opposition.

The take-away from this intellectual exercise should be sobering, both for the CCP and the international community. To date, few have seriously thought about the probability and the various plausible scenarios of a regime transition in China. As we go through the likely causes and scenarios of such a transition, it should become blindingly clear that we need to start thinking about both the unthinkable and the inevitable.",2013-02-13 08:00:00+00:00,"['democracy', 'political', 'regime', 'democratic', 'collapse', 'party', 'rule', 'transition', 'financial', 'regimes', 'china', 'ways']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
459,DR-2021-000022-AFG,UK pledges £35m to Afghanistan as food crisis worsens - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/27/uk-pledges-35m-to-afghanistan-as-food-crisis-worsens,"The UK government has announced £35m of new funding to help the growing crisis in Afghanistan as a new report warns that almost half of the rural population – 10.6 million people – are likely to be affected by severe food insecurity.

The report, by independent multi-agency body the IPC, highlighted the spread of conflict and the ongoing drought which has displaced over 250,000 people, impacting Afghan incomes and leading to widespread malnutrition among children. Coupled with high food prices, there is significant cause to believe that extensive suffering could lead the country deeper into a humanitarian crisis. In a country where 20 million people rely on farming, the drought has caused a 45% drop in agricultural output this year, according to the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture.

Announcing the initiative, the UK international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said “This deadly drought is already affecting millions of Afghans, many of whom have had to leave their homes and livelihoods in desperate search of basic necessities. UK aid will provide life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of Afghans, including food, clean water, and tents.”

Calling for an international response to avert the crisis Mordaunt said: “Other donors must do more if we are to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.”

She said that the initiative will provide tents and urgent relief items for up to 260,000 people, food or cash transfers to buy essential items for up to 602,660, with a monthly ration of special nutritious food to prevent malnutrition in young children, and access to healthcare, clean water and sanitation for those affected by drought.

DfID explained that funding for the initiative will consist of £25m from their crisis reserve fund in addition to £10m already provided this year, bringing UK expenditure on the humanitarian response in Afghanistan to £67m.

A separate report also highlights the ongoing debate over the transparency and effectiveness of US efforts to assist in rebuilding the country’s infrastructure.

“The Afghan government now controls or influences the lowest proportion of its own territory since they began monitoring this data in November 2015,” according to the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar), which published details of an audit into US efforts to rebuild Afghanistan’s infrastructure.

The report points to a lack of planning, monitoring and evaluation by the US Department of Defense (US DoD) over four contracts worth $1.62bn (£1.26bn) awarded to DynCorp International to provide contract advisors at the Afghan Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Ministry of Interior (MoI). Two of the four contracts, valued at $421m, are due to expire this month.

The supposed lack of transparency has allegedly been caused by frequent changes to the rating systems used to measure progress. Between January 2015 and December 2016, 96% of plans and milestones for the Afghan MoD changed and 86% of those for MoI, making it almost impossible to gauge effectiveness and impact of US support.

One area of concern is the lack of training, highlighted as “an important aspect that must be addressed,” by a former combined security transition commander. Reports suggest that there is limited tracking of staff transferred to advisory roles once deployed to the region, leading to questions of suitability and experience. This is coupled with the lack of training standards, with little or no training reportedly being given to uniformed US staff arriving on deployment to help them perform their roles. A recent survey by Sigar revealed that 45% of uniformed staff had received no advisor training before deployment.

When asked, the central command for the US DoD were unable to provide staff training statistics to Sigar, stating they did not retain data relating to who and when staff were trained, leading to questions over the quality of service being offered to Afghanistan.

Twice a week, Farid Rahimi gets up at dawn, wraps a blanket around his shoulders to keep warm, gathers his empty jerrycans, and waits beside the tap outside his house in a hillside neighbourhood above Kabul.

At 7am sharp, water bursts from the pipes, filling Rahimi’s tank and buckets. He labours away, saving every drop until – just an hour later – the last drop falls.

“We can’t afford to miss it,” said the 35-year-old. “It’s barely enough.“

Afghanistan’s capital is running dry – its groundwater levels depleted by an expanding population and the long-term impacts of climate change. But its teeming informal settlements continue to grow as decades-long conflict and – more recently – drought drive people like Rahimi into the cities, straining already scarce water supplies.

With large numbers migrating to Kabul, the city’s resources are overstretched and aid agencies and the government are facing a new problem: how to adjust to a shifting population still dependent on some form of humanitarian assistance.

e21b5337_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN Farid Rahimi prepares to fill jerrycans with water. His family has access to clean drinking water twice a week for only an hour. Rahimi fills up every available bucket and jerrycan to make sure the water lasts through the rest of the week.

Rahimi came to Kabul nine years ago to find safety and better job opportunities, but he says it hasn’t been easy. He now shares his house with 12 family members and each month he pays a steep 1,500 Afghani, or $20, for water from a private company.

“Last year we shut down our well,” Rahimi said. “There wasn’t any water left. A few years ago, the situation was a lot better.”

On the move

The UN says more than half a million people in Afghanistan were forced to leave their homes in 2018 due to conflict and drought. An even greater number of Afghans, more than 800,000, returned from Pakistan and Iran during the same year. About seven percent of Kabul’s population are either displaced by war or returnees who previously fled the country, according to estimates from the UN’s migration agency, IOM.

The majority migrate toward cities, which are now home to one third of Afghanistan’s population of 36 million. According to UN Habitat, 80 percent of urban areas in Kabul are informal settlements.

e21b4210_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN Kabul’s outskirts are home to informal settlements where the majority of residents are people displaced from the countryside by fighting and drought. While some families arrived in recent months, others have lived in these settlements for years.

In Rahimi’s case this means that a muddy, unpaved road winds its way through his neighbourhood and up an overpopulated hill, where simple mud or concrete houses have been built on “grab land”, claimed by those who arrived in Kabul over the past decade without initially registering or even purchasing the property. Electricity is available sporadically, while health facilities and schools are either absent or far away. A private company is in the process of installing water pipes throughout the neighbourhood, but most public services are yet to be provided by the government.

But when people from rural areas leave their homes for the cities, they may also leave behind the humanitarian aid they had previously relied on.

Pir Mohammed arrived in Kabul five months ago, escaping violence and bombings in his native Helmand province, a Taliban heartland in southern Afghanistan.

The 35-year-old had hoped the move would make his life safer and easier. But the family lives in a tent in the middle of Afghanistan’s bitter winter; his cousin has pneumonia.

“It’s just so cold. In Helmand, we received some assistance. Here, we were told the government would help us, but nothing has happened so far,” Mohammed said, while digging a trench outside his shelter to prevent water from leaking into the tent.

e21b4661_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN Pir Mohammed shovels dirt in front of his cousin's tent. His family arrived in Kabul five months ago, fleeing fighting and air strikes in Helmand province. He says it’s safer in Kabul, but he can’t access the humanitarian aid he relied on back home.

Much of the snow falling onto the family’s home is melted and used as drinking water. The current winter has been harsh, with temperatures dropping well below zero most nights.

Rethinking aid

Alison Parker, UNICEF’s communications chief, said the urban shift means aid groups must also rethink how to help people who may still need assistance in the cities.

“Rurally, it’s easier because you engage with communities at the local level. In Kabul, we need to engage with the government and other actors,” Parker said. “It needs a shift in thought and more players need to be on board.”

Yet city planning and humanitarian work often do not go hand in hand, says the city’s deputy mayor, Shoaib Rahim. “Humanitarian services are meeting immediate needs, but urban planning is for the long term,” he said.

While aid agencies do provide some services in urban areas, especially in places where newly displaced people have settled, both private companies and the government take up large – yet still insufficient – chunks of the work.

“Aid professionals often distinguish between humanitarian work and development, but they are intertwined,” said Oxfam Afghanistan country director Ruby Ajanee.

The majority of former refugees and asylum seekers returning from abroad, for example, settle in urban areas, where they may need both short-term aid and and more long-lasting help.

“While their immediate needs for food and shelter are addressed by humanitarian agencies, the long-term development needs of reintegration are addressed by the development agencies, with often a disconnect from the humanitarian agencies,” Ajanee said. “These two sectors have to work together seamlessly where humanitarian effort is linked with development work.”

Rainfall patterns

Comparatively, urban residents are still better off than their rural counterparts. The proportion of people with access to basic water is 63 percent countrywide – 89 percent for the urban population and 53 percent for rural households, according to UNICEF. But migration patterns and a changing climate point to long-term strains on water supplies.

e21b5657_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN A man draws water from a public pump in Kabul. Many households lack access to water in their homes, and groundwater levels have been depleted in recent years.

Afghanistan is one of the world’s top eight countries affected by climate change-induced water shortages, says Paulos Workneh, who heads the water, sanitation and hygiene programme for UNICEF in Afghanistan. As groundwater deteriorates, city dwellers are robbed of their main source of clean water.

“Most of Kabul’s water was accessed through wells, but the situation is now under stress,” Workneh said. “Surface water is polluted by industrial waste, pit latrines and chemicals leaping into the rivers. With rainfall patterns decreasing, sources don’t fill up as quickly anymore.”

While Kabul is starting to tackle the issue of informally built properties – including the registration of many houses initially constructed without permission – one fact remains: the capital grew too quickly.

“The city had 4.6 million people in 2002 and, by 2012, the numbers went up to 7.1 million,” said Koussay Boulaich of UN Habitat, which is offering technical support to a government project responding to the city’s urbanisation trend.

By 2050, one in two Afghans will live in cities, Boulaich said. A similar shift will be needed among the many humanitarian and development groups now concentrating their work in Afghanistan’s rural areas.

“Imagine how important the correlation between urbanisation and development is,” Boulaich said. “In some areas, humanitarian and development work merge, supporting the government in providing long-term sustainable solutions, and urbanisation has to be one of these areas.”

e21b5353_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN A private company has started drilling and construction for new water pipes in this Kabul neighbourhood. Informally built homes line the hillsides in the background.

Reverse city planning

One of the government’s programmes for urban development, including water, is its “City for All” scheme, which aims to turn the country’s urban migration into economic growth, increase living standards, and even contribute to peace. As part of the plan, informal areas in Kabul are now being registered, roads are being built, and water systems are being set up slowly, with technical help from international agencies.

Mohammed Atik, 60, lives in a Kabul neighbourhood currently undergoing development.

“The government has built the pipes in our area. There are none in my house yet, but I do see progress,” he said.

For now, however, his household well has dried up. He gets water for his family only by filling up buckets at a neighbour’s house, and he’s worried what will happen if this supply also evaporates.

“I just hope we don't run further out of water,” Atik said. “We’re already using a lot less than a few years ago.”

In Rahimi’s hillside neighbourhood, the government has promised to pave the road in the coming months, while mainly private companies supply the available water.

Merza Mohammed, a 42-year-old employee with Absharan Tagyet, the company laying pipes down Rahimi’s street, said the new infrastructure will serve roughly 1,300 households – though at a price more expensive than the city government’s standard rates.

“We’re a local business supplying areas that the government has not yet reached,” he said.

A few years ago, water was more widely available throughout the city. But prices have more than doubled, he said.

“Today, we’re scrambling. Water is becoming a pricey commodity in Afghanistan.”

166,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka feels the heat - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/4/29/sri-lanka-feels-the-heat,"Over the past few weeks, temperatures across South Asia have steadily built up ahead of the summer rains.

There has been much talk of the severe heat and, at times, drought conditions that have accompanied this pre-monsoon heat across India and Pakistan.

Sri Lanka has suffered alongside them as the sweltering conditions have intensified.

Temperatures in Colombo, the nation’s capital, have been running just above the April average of 31 degrees Celsius. However, the humid onshore winds have made it feel more like 36C.

Despite the high temperatures, this remains a part of the world where many people do not have air conditioning in their homes.

The young and the elderly are most vulnerable and warnings have been issued across the country.

The heat has even been felt up on the higher ground. Nuwara Eliya is a city in the tea country hills of central Sri Lanka, it is known as little England because climate in the city is similar to that in parts of Europe.

Nuwara Eliya normally has an April temperature of around 10 to 15C. The mercury reached 24C on Wednesday. Recent days have seen highs nearer 22C.

The heat will only really be broken with the onset of the southwest monsoon and the summer rains.

That remains another month away. In the meantime much of south Asia will feel the heat and increasing humidity for some time to come.",2017-04-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['feel', 'summer', 'city', 'heat', 'lanka', 'temperatures', 'sri', 'conditions', 'south', 'feels', 'eliya', 'remains']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
480,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia braces for record levels of displacement as drought takes hold - Norwegian Refugee Council,https://www.nrc.no/news/2021/april/somalia-drought/,"“Once again Somalia is facing the prospect of serious drought. Water and pasture resources are depleting every day and resulting in people abandoning their homes with their livestock to search for better conditions. We are worried that drought coupled with conflict could see record levels of displacement this year,” said Mohamed Abdi, Country Director for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Somalia.

According to data from the Protection and Monitoring Returns Network (PRMN), over one million people were displaced by floods, conflict and drought in Somalia last year, the highest figures recorded since 2016. So far, 112,000 have been displaced in the first three months of 2021, of whom 34 per cent were uprooted because of drought.

The last time more than a million people were displaced in Somalia was in 2017, when drought ravaged the country and caused widespread suffering and uncertainty.

“Drought will most likely be the driving factor displacing a large number of Somalis this year due to the poor performance of seasonal rains. Our staff on the ground are reporting that more than 50 districts are currently experiencing moderate to severe drought levels and it is expected to get worse,” Abdi said.

In Somalia, the impact of drought runs parallel with the impact of flooding in other parts of the country.

“It sounds contradictory but simultaneous flooding and drought are a reality in Somalia. Flooding was the main driver of high displacement last year. Some rains have dropped in the past number of days so our teams on the ground are also working towards flooding preparedness and to support those in critical need. We have to prepare for all climate shocks,” Mohamed Abdi explained.

The UN’s 2021 aid appeal for Somalia seeks $1.09 billion to assist four million people in dire need, as a result of widespread insecurity, recurring climate disasters and the indirect economic impact of Covid-19.

“Around 13 per cent of Somalia’s aid appeal has been donated so far, nowhere near enough to sustain the population as it battles drought and multiple other crises. The international community must not turn their back on Somalis, particularly pastoralist communities, who are impacted the most. We must do all we can to prevent another cycle of suffering in Somalia,” Abdi said.

1467,FL-2019-000179-CAN,How brokers can stop a flooded basement - Canadian Underwriter,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/how-brokers-can-stop-a-flooded-basement-1004162024/,"A recent study suggests brokers have a golden opportunity to talk to homeowners one-on-one about how to protect homes from basement floods.

With the right information and often for less than $500, homeowners can protect themselves from the increasing risks of basement floods, according to a report from the University of Waterloo. The study suggests homeowners are looking to people they trust — such as brokers — to provide the right information.

“Our project tested the effectiveness of various outreach approaches to motivate residents to address basement flood risk,” said Cheryl Evans, director of the Home Flood Protection Program (HFPP) at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation. “Sending out flyers and posting tips on social media helps to raise awareness, but that is not enough. Residents trust advice from flood-impacted neighbours, insurance providers and even informed staff at hardware stores…

“One-on-one conversations with people they trust make all the difference for many people.”

What information can brokers provide to their clients about basement flooding?

The HFPP studied results from home flood risk assessments completed by flood risk assessors at more than 500 homes in southern Ontario and Saskatchewan in 2017 and 2018. Based on the study, the report reveals the Top 10 ways for homeowners to protect themselves against basement flooding; several of the items cost less than $500 and can be done over the weekend.

Home assessments in Ontario found a number of common issues inside the home, including:

no backup sump pump, or backup power to run the sump pump in case of emergency (85%)

basement furniture and electronics at risk of water damage (71%)

lack of maintenance of backwater valves (53%)

failure to maintain sump pumps (40%)

Outside the home, the assessments revealed:

window wells lower than 10 to 15 cm above grade (82%)

downspouts that deposit water less than two meters from the foundation (78%)

poor grading that directs water towards the foundation (69%)

cracks or gaps in the basement windows (63%)

Homeowners in the study cited cost as the Number 1 reason why they did not complete the repairs or installations necessary to prevent basement floods. But the price tag paled in comparison to the average price to repair a flooded basement — $43,000 in 2018.

Sixty percent of study participants reported completing actions that cost under $500 and could be done by a “handy” homeowner generally within a day. Examples included: storing valuables in waterproof containers or removing them from the basement; cleaning out eavestroughs; installing window well covers; and extending downspouts and sump pump discharge pipes to a minimum of two metres away from the foundation.

Forty percent of participants completed actions that were more complex, costly and often required the support of qualified contractors. The cost of completing these actions ranged widely from $500 to over $10,000. Some of these actions included installing a backwater valve, backup sump pump or backup battery; re-lining or replacing a sewer lateral; installing a sewer lateral cleanout; replacing basement windows; replacing eaves troughs; replacing a driveway; and installing window wells.",2019-04-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['pump', 'homeowners', 'brokers', 'risk', 'sump', '500', 'basement', 'flooded', 'installing', 'replacing', 'flood', 'study', 'stop']",Canada,news article,English

Mar 21, Colombo: In a special event held at the Presidential Secretariat today, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu ceremonially handed over the keys of eight Lorry Water Bowsers to President Maithripala Sirisena, as part of India's assistance to augment Drought Relief measures in Sri Lanka.

The commitment to donate eight water bowsers and 100 metric tonnes of rice as immediate assistance for drought relief was made by Foreign Secretary of India Dr. Jaishankar on behalf of Minister of External Affairs, Mrs. Sushma Swaraj to Sri Lanka Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mangala Samaraweera, during his recent visit to Sri Lanka in February 2017.

Pursuant to this commitment, India handed over eight lorry mounted water bowsers, locally purchased from Lanka Ashok Leyland, at a cost of Rs. 25 million to Sri Lanka today.

Handing over of the bowsers is part of India�s continued commitment to assist Sri Lanka whenever required, the High Commission said

730,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Up Next Our Impact on Climate Change and Global Land Use in 5 Charts - Visual Capitalist,https://www.visualcapitalist.com/impact-on-climate-change-and-land-use/,"Our Impact on Climate Change and Land Use in 5 Charts

As the world population approaches the eight billion mark, it’s becoming clear that we’re impacting the planet in unprecedented ways.

Humans have made such dramatic changes to Earth’s systems, from climate to geology, that many are suggesting we’ve entered into a new epoch – the Anthropocene.

To better understand the challenges of this era of wide-sweeping human impact on the planet, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced a massive report covering land use and climate change.

According to the IPCC, the situation is looking more dire by the year. Below are a few of the key insights buried within the 1,400+ pages of the massive report.

Shifting Global Land Use

The scale of land use and loss of biodiversity are unprecedented in human history.

According to the report, roughly two-thirds of the world’s ice-free land is now devoted to human uses. Ecosystems, both forested and unforested, only account for about 16% of land today. Part of the reason for this dwindling supply of natural habitat is the rapid increase of agricultural activity around the world.

Since the dawn of the 20th century, global land use has shifted dramatically:

Not only has land use changed, but so has farming itself. In many parts of the world, increased yields will primarily come from existing agricultural land. For example, wheat yields are projected to increase 11% by the year 2026, despite the growing area only increasing by 1.8%. Rice production exhibits a similar trend, with 93% of the projected increase expected to come from increased yields rather than from area expansion. In some cases, intensive farming practices can degrade soil more than 100x faster than the time it takes for new soil to form, leaving fertilizers to pick up the slack.

One of the most dramatic changes highlighted in the report is the nearly eight-fold increase in the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers since the early 1960s. These types of fertilizers are having serious downstream effects on aquatic ecosystems, in some cases creating “dead zones” such as the one in the Gulf of Mexico.

In addition to the negative impacts outlined above, the simple act of feeding ourselves also accounts for one-third of our global greenhouse gas footprint.

Things are Heating Up

The past half-decade is likely to become the warmest five-year stretch in recorded history, underscoring the rapid pace of climate change. On a global scale, even a small increase in temperature can have a big impact on climate and our ecosystems.

For example, air can hold approximately 7% more moisture for every 1ºC increase, leading to an uptick in extreme rainfall events. These events can trigger landslides, increase the rate of soil erosion, and damage crops – just one example of how climate change can cause a chain reaction.

For the billions of people who live in “drylands”, climate change is serving up a completely different scenario:

“Heatwaves are projected to increase in frequency, intensity and duration in most parts of the world and drought frequency and intensity is projected to increase in some regions that are already drought prone.”

— IPCC report on Climate Change and Land, 2019

This is particularly worrisome as 90% of people in these arid or semiarid regions live in developing economies that are still very reliant on agriculture.

In addition to water scarcity, the IPCC has identified a number of other categories, including soil erosion and permafrost degradation.

The city is cutting the water supply to consumers to just 40% of normal levels, Casimiro Abreu, deputy director of the National Emergency Centre said in a statement.

About 1.3 million people in Maputo and its surroundings are affected by the restrictions, raising fears of disease outbreaks.

""Diarrhoeal diseases including cholera are likely to occur in some neighbourhoods where populations will resort to unsafe sources; there,"" said Abreu.

Low rainfall over the past three years has left a dam that supplies the city with most of its water to just 19% of capacity.

Meteorologists forecast that the region will receive below-normal rains during the first three months of this year.

Southern Africa has experienced a severe drought in recent years, aggravated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

Cape Town in neighbouring South Africa faces the prospect of having to turn its taps off in early June and now restricts residents to 50 litres per day.

The water scarcity has forced South Africa to declare the drought a ""national disaster"".

1909,FL-2020-000207-NGA,"Nigeria: Aftermath of Boko Haram Invasion - Niger State Communities in Panic Mode As Victims, Others Flood IDPs Camps - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/202104300443.html,"Slowly and stealthily they crept into their target areas as planned. And before people, their intended victims, knew of their ominous presence, they struck without mercy, leaving in their wake blood, death and tears. That is how the dreaded Boko Haram insurgents announced and registered their presence in Niger State.

Typically, as they have done previously elsewhere, they did not hesitate to hoist their flags of evil after carrying out acts of brutality. Quietly settling down in Kaore community in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state, they soon began to attack innocent farmers, burning their property, killing some and dispossessing them of their valuables and crops. Like the devil, they simply want to steal, kill and destroy against the wish of government to protect and defend lives and property of the people.

From Kaore, where the bandits and terrorists have set up their base, it is apparent that they can gain unhindered access to the 24 other local governments of the state and carry out their nefarious activities, leaving more woes on their trail in the process.

The alarming situation had forced the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, to cry out. Bello, who is not known to panic and raise alarms like some other Nigerian politicians do, has quickly come out to alert the nation that Boko Haram terrorists were already incubating in his state.

At a public forum, Governor Bello thundered without reservation: ""I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaore in Shiroro Local Government Area, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags there.

Innocent wives of the men in the affected communities have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.

""I just heard that they have placed their flags at Kaore, meaning they have taken over the territory. This is what I have been engaging the Federal Government on, but unfortunately, it has now got to this level, and if care is not taken even Abuja will not be safe.

""We have been saying this for long but all our efforts have been in vain. But with the latest development, I hope the time has come for a more coordinated military activity to take place. With the development, the Boko Haram elements are trying to use this area as their home base just as they have done in Sambisa. Sambisa is several kilometres away from Abuja, but Kaore is just two kilometres away from Abuja and as such so nobody is safe anymore; not even those in Abuja.""

For now, the villages mostly affected by the terrorists' presence in the state are: Allawa, Bassa/Kukoki, Gurmana, Manta, Galadima Logo, Kwaki/Chukubo, Kurebe, Kushaka and Erena.

As a result of the takeover of the areas, the villagers have fled their homes and farms in Shiroro, Rafi, Munya and Wushishi and taken refuge in camps in the capital, Minna. One of the camps located within the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School adjacent the Emir of Minna Palace, is now congested because of the fleeing villagers sacked by the bandits a few days ago from neighbouring villages.

Besides the IBB Camp, two others camps situated at Maitumbi and Maikunkele in the city centre, are facing accommodation challenges due to the large number of displaced and stranded persons swarming the places on a daily basis for help, just as their anger and frustration keep flaring daily due to the absence of basic medical or support facilities.

While the governor raised the alarm apparently to elicit military support for the state, his declaration that nobody was safe as a result of the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the state, has however drawn the ire of the people, who accuse him and the Federal Government of not doing enough to protect them despite their agricultural production and contribution to the economy of the state and Nigeria as a whole.

The anger of the affected communities was taken to a new height when the Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, announced that the state government had provided a paltry N2 million for the upkeep of the inmates of the various IDPs camps. Although the announcement of the amount was apparently meant to draw support for the state, the victims of the attacks dismissed it as a ruse and nothing to cheer about given their plight.

The first to fire the salvo against the meagre amount was the President of Lakpma Youths Assembly, Comrade Jibrin Alawa, who described the N2 milion for the various camps as an insult to the people. He pointed out that as concerned villagers, they had paid millions of naira as ransom to the bandits in a few months to secure the release of their kinsmen and that the amount announced by the government was meaningless to them. ""Both the governor and his deputy should resign immediately to pave way for more sympathetic, competent and more committed people.

Our people have paid more than the N2 million announced by the government as upkeep for these people fleeing from Shiroro and Munya. We are farmers. We don't need food donations from the government. What we need from government at all levels is adequate security for our people to go and farm, get enough money for themselves to improve the economy and also feed the Nation,"" he declared.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter rose from an emergency security meeting held at its secretariat in Minna, yesterday, with a call on the state government not to give up but strive further towards providing adequate security to its people.

State Chairman of CAN, Reverend Mattias Echioda, in an exclusive interview with Arewa Voice described the signal from the governor as totally losing hope in the security of the country.

He said: ""The pronouncement of the governor clearly shows defeatism and if the chief security officer of the state can submit thus, where would the followers run to. The state governor as the number one citizen and chief security officer should not be easily discouraged or easily submissive but should restrategize and be more proactive in facing the security challenges with a renewed vigour.""

Echioda called on all Christians in the state to rise up in prayers more than before for God's intervention in the security challenges confronting the state in particular and the country in general just as he called on them to send in donations including foodstuffs, detergents, beddings, water among others to the CAN Secretariat for onward transmission to the various IDP Camps in the state.

Meanwhile, the CAN has declared next week Wednesday to Friday for fasting and prayers over the insecurity in the state and country generally.

Meeting in Paris, they signed a



The U7+ summit on 9 and 10 July was attended by university presidents from the G7 advanced economy countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. They were joined by leaders from higher education institutions in Argentina, Australia, Ghana, India, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea.*



They adopted

University World News is solely responsible for the editorial content. This article is part of a series onpublished byin partnership withis solely responsible for the editorial content.

The six principles, which have actions embedded, include:

• Pursue joint action through the U7+, including meeting each year in the context of the G7 process, “so that our actions can weigh in the discussions and contribute to making positive change a reality”.





• Recognise universities’ distinctive responsibility to train and nurture responsible and active citizens who will contribute to society, from the local to the global level.





• Recognise that “our universities have a major role to play in addressing the environmental issues and challenges to sustainability such as climate change, biodiversity and energy transition. This should include leading by example on our own campuses.”





• Recognise that universities have a distinctive and leading role to play regarding equality and inclusiveness in the world, and in combating polarisation in society.





• To engage with stakeholders and solve complex issues of global relevance universities must promote interdisciplinary research and learning, in particular bridging in research and teaching between social sciences, humanities, the life sciences and STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).





• Recognise that the U7+ “has the power to serve as a lab to consolidate best practices that can be shared both within our network and more broadly with universities and similar institutions worldwide for inspiration”.

The five global challenges the U7+ will focus on are: universities’ key role in a global world; climate change and cleaner energy; inequality and polarised societies; technological transformations; and community engagement and impact.



Patronage of President Macron



Under the patronage of French President Emmanuel Macron, the newly formed U7+ is an initiative of



They recognised that the themes of the forthcoming G7 summit were relevant to their university role and raison d’être.



“Universities have always been and remain global actors, and we act upon issues that relate to the G7 agenda,” said Vanessa Scherrer, vice-president for international affairs at Sciences Po, one of the founding institutions and current chair of U7+.



“G7 started opening to civil society a few years ago – there are now engagement groups for women, for youth, academies of science, business, work and so on.



“In that context, the U7+ is an alliance of world universities taking action in the area of the G7, and in a special way: rather than making recommendations to the heads of state of the G7, we will present our commitments to action, as a way of trying to make a change and lead by example. This is the DNA of U7+.”



With the G7 opening to civil society, new ideas and countries beyond the G7, and the fact that there were no engagement groups or ministerial meetings related to higher education and research, “the idea [for an alliance of universities] was discussed between the French founding universities and we realised it would be important for the world,” said Scherrer.



Rapid formation



The university alliance was created “in a very short time”, she said. “The first meeting of the French steering committee was in April, and we decided collectively on which international colleagues to invite – five universities from each of the G7 countries.”



The G7 universities then proposed institutions in other countries* to join their alliance. “The response was high from the outset, so we quickly realised our intuition was right,” said Scherrer.



The organisers had only a few weeks to negotiate and set up the complex international arrangements to establish the alliance in time for G7 preparatory meetings in June, before the first U7+ summit in July.



With the G7’s open approach to other countries under the French presidency, what was originally simply the ‘U7’ Alliance of world universities added ‘Plus’ to its title to become U7+, in recognition that universities from outside the group have joined.



U7+ leaders must now present their commitments to their faculty, students and staff, who have “a decisive role to play in these actions”, said Scherrer.



Interdisciplinarity stressed



She stressed the importance of interdisciplinarity in U7+ institutions, “especially topics related to new technology and its impact. It is important that STEM students are trained in the social sciences.”



For the future, after France hands on the G7 presidency to the United States at the end of 2019, Scherrer says: “At that point, we can say that the 47 presidents have committed U7+ to meet next year in the context of the G7 summit, whatever happens. We will remain a very flexible organisation, but universities from France, the US and UK, successive chairs of the G7, will work together.



“We are committed to meeting once a year, probably in a G7 country. We shall hold a mid-term meeting, and keep contact among us to monitor actions, and stay in touch with sherpas [the representatives of heads of state or government who prepare for the summits] to prepare for the next G7 summit.”



Monitoring is a high priority, and the ‘champion’ institutions will work together to harmonise the action.



“For example, on climate change,” said Scherrer, “all the champions have agreed to make systems comparable, with harmonised indicators, measurements, deadlines, deals and platforms.”



U7+ could take on different commitments in future, she said. The present ones “arose as key fields in which we are already global actors, and connected to the agenda of the G7 in France this year, but we agreed it could change next year, like the G7 which has a new focus each year”.



* Institutions that attended the U7+ summit are listed at the end of the Declaration.



At the first summit of the U7+ Alliance, an international alliance of leading universities from the Group of Seven (G7) countries and beyond, presidents of 47 institutions from 18 countries, representing more than two million students worldwide, adopted six principles to tackle five major global challenges.Meeting in Paris, they signed a Declaration committing to take concrete action related to themes of the G7 summit that will take place in Biarritz at the end of August under the 2019 French presidency.The U7+ summit on 9 and 10 July was attended by university presidents from the G7 advanced economy countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. They were joined by leaders from higher education institutions in Argentina, Australia, Ghana, India, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea.*They adopted six principles to which a total of 245 individual actions are connected, in line with the G7 summit agenda. Universities will undertake specific actions within their own institutions, and several ‘champion’ institutions will oversee planning, coordination and monitoring of the participating working groups.The six principles, which have actions embedded, include:The five global challenges the U7+ will focus on are: universities’ key role in a global world; climate change and cleaner energy; inequality and polarised societies; technological transformations; and community engagement and impact.Under the patronage of French President Emmanuel Macron, the newly formed U7+ is an initiative of 13 French higher education institutions They recognised that the themes of the forthcoming G7 summit were relevant to their university role and“Universities have always been and remain global actors, and we act upon issues that relate to the G7 agenda,” said Vanessa Scherrer, vice-president for international affairs at Sciences Po, one of the founding institutions and current chair of U7+.“G7 started opening to civil society a few years ago – there are now engagement groups for women, for youth, academies of science, business, work and so on.“In that context, the U7+ is an alliance of world universities taking action in the area of the G7, and in a special way: rather than making recommendations to the heads of state of the G7, we will present our commitments to action, as a way of trying to make a change and lead by example.

The scene of her poisoning - Olivier, a restaurant in the glitzy Grand Indonesia shopping mall in central Jakarta - has become an improbable tourist attraction, with a non-toxic version of the Vietnamese iced coffee that killed Salihin a macabrely popular choice.

According to the indictment read in court, Salihin had criticised Wongso's boyfriend in Australia, whom she claimed was rude and a drug user.

""The words of Mirna made the defendant angry and hurt and the defendant decided to cut communication with Mirna,"" the indictment said.

TWITTER The scene of the crime: Jessica Wongso takes part in a police-organised re-enactment at the Olivier Cafe.

It said Wongso subsequently broke up with her boyfriend and had some legal problems in Australia.

A Fairfax Media investigation revealed Wongso was listed to appear before a Sydney magistrate on a high range drink driving charge on February 26 but was already in custody in Indonesia.

""To avenge her anger, the defendant planned to take away Mirna's life,"" the indictment read before the court said.

JEWEL TOPSFIELD/FAIRFAX The husband: ""I want justice,"" says Wyan Mirna Salihin's widower, Arief Soemarko.

It said Wongso, who worked for Ambulance NSW until late last year, re-established contact with Salihin and it was arranged they would meet at Olivier Cafe on January 6 with another friend, Hani.

According to the indictment Wongso arrived early, ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee and two cocktails and added cyanide to the coffee.

""Jessica said: 'This is for you Mir, you said you want Vietnamese Iced Coffee',"" the court heard. ""Then Mirna drank it and said: 'It's not tasty, it's awful', waving her hands in front of her mouth due to the hot flavour it made. Two minutes later Mirna fell unconscious.""

TATAN SYUFLANA/FAIRFAX NZ Jessica Wongso fronts Central Jakarta Court accused of the murder of her friend.

Salihin died on the way to hospital.

Wongso's lawyer, Otto Hasibuan, questioned why Wongso would travel all the way from Australia to Indonesia to kill Salihin just because she was hurt about what her friend had said about her ex-boyfriend.

He also said the indictment did not elaborate on when or how the cyanide was purchased.

But the prosecution insisted in court on Tuesday that it had strong evidence of Wongso's guilt.

Asked what the prosecution had told the court to counter the defence argument that the indictment was absurd, Chief Prosecutor Ardito Muwadi said the important element of premeditated murder was the intention in the defendant's heart and how calm they were in carrying out their plan.

The trial has implications for Australia because the Australian Federal Police (AFP) agreed to assist with investigating the case after the Indonesian government provided written assurance that Wongso would not face the death penalty if found guilty.

Although Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly has confirmed this, Indonesia' chief security minister, Luhut Panjaitan, appeared to equivocate during a trip to Sydney earlier this month, saying: ""Well, I think we leave it to the judge, the court, but I believe we work it out (the) Indonesian way.""

Salihin's father, Dermawan Salihin, said he did not believe the agreement with the AFP should be upheld if Wongso is convicted on the basis of evidence from Indonesia.

""Secondly, Jessica is not Australian, she is just a permanent resident,"" he said.

Salihin said cyanide was readily and cheaply available in Indonesia as pest control for farmers.",2016-06-22 07:00:00+00:00,"['coffee', 'mirna', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'planning', 'woman', 'killed', 'jakarta', 'cyanide', 'court', 'indictment', 'wongso', 'start', 'australia', 'jessica', 'family', 'salihin']",India,news article,English
924,DR-2011-000121-CHN,The limits of farming - The Boston Globe - Boston Globe,http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2011/09/04/the_limits_of_farming/,"BY THE year 2050, Earth will be home to another 2 or 3 billion more people. The most vexing question is: How will we feed them all? Not only will there be more people, but everyone will have more money to spend on food. Where, on this ever more crowded planet, will we grow all of it?

By 2050, the world’s farmers will need to supply almost twice as much food as they do today, according to an analysis by the World Wildlife Fund. Put another way, we will need to produce as much food in the next 40 years as have in the last 8,000.

Where will the food come from? Today, we use about a third of the planet’s land surface for agriculture, according to Jason Clay, a senior vice president at the fund who prepared the analysis. But when you subtract the areas that are already “taken’’ - deserts, mountains, lakes, rivers, cities, and highways - the figure rises to about 58 percent of the land. Take out the national parks and other protected areas, and food production already consumes 70 percent of available space. At current growth rates, Clay says, we will be nearing the planet’s capacity by 2050.

For every square inch of unclaimed land to be converted to farming would be an irreversible ecological disaster. But even if you are entirely deaf to green arguments, the problem is fundamental and unavoidable: At some point, the amount of land devoted to agriculture must stop expanding, because there is only so much land.

What we must do, then, is freeze the footprint of food - find a way to roughly double the productivity of farming, so that we can produce twice as much food on the same amount of land. It is a daunting technological and social challenge, and one that does not have a single solution, according to Clay’s report on the idea in a recent issue of Nature.

The most powerful tool is one that makes some environmentalists uncomfortable: genetics. The tools of modern biology have brought tremendous improvements in some crops, like corn, by breeding in traits like faster growth and increased resistance to drought and disease. But of the 10 crops that produce about three quarters of the world’s food, only one is on track to double production by 2050.

A consortium including the World Wildlife Fund and BGI, a genome research group based in China, will be working through a list of “orphan crops,’’ such as cassava, banana, and peanuts, which are widely used for food, but which have not had their DNA sequenced. Such information would make breeding useful traits faster and more efficient.

Without genetics, it is hard to see how the footprint of food will ever be frozen, or how we will avoid hitting the planet’s limited land capacity. For those who shudder at the very mention of genetics, remember that genetic manipulation is what created almost all the food we eat. Those delicious heirloom tomatoes you enjoy? They are the product of genetic engineering - albeit a cumbersome form of it - at the hands of farmers.

Another approach is to reclaim land that was farmed and then abandoned. When I spoke with Clay recently, he was in Brazil, and he told me that some farmers there were buying degraded land and using no-till farming to grow soybeans. The value of the land has been increasing even more than the income from their crops - a win for everyone.

“What they are doing is growing soil instead of soybeans,’’ Clay said.

The planet’s limited land area is a stark fact that changes how you look at farming. For example, from a long-term global perspective, organic farming is a problem. Organic generally takes more land to produce the same amount of food. Done on a vast scale, it could aggravate the conversion of wild land to agriculture.

There are many problems vying for our attention, but this is one we simply have to get a handle on: Farming must get better, or it will continue to expand - until it can’t.

1009,Drought Sri Lanka,Inundated colonial bungalow resurfaces after thirty years - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/inundated-colonial-bungalow-resurfaces-after-thirty-years/article4756301.ece,"The bungalow was built during 1886-87 by British industrialist T.J. Cameroon with permission from then Travancore Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma to start a paper mill at Punalur.

A colonial bungalow that “drowned” thirty years ago has surfaced from its watery grave in the reservoir of the Thenmala Dam in Kollam district.

The spot is about 3 km from the dam top and can be reached after a 45-minute trek through the forest. The resurfaced bungalow looks eerie from a distance. Yet, one is overwhelmed on entering it after squelching across knee-deep silt.

The water in the reservoir has receded to an unprecedented low in the wake of the drought in Kollam district.

Shortly before the structure was inundated in 1983 by the waters of the Kallada Irrigation Project (KIP), its teak doors, windows and rafters had been auctioned.

The bungalow was built in 1886-87 by the British industrialist T.J. Cameroon who was given permission by the then Travancore Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma (1885 to 1924) to start a paper mill at Punalur, using the abundantly growing reeds in the surrounding dense forest as raw material.

Commissioned in 1888, the paper mill was initially christened the Travancore Paper Mills. The name changed to Lakshmi Paper Mills, then to Meenakshi Paper Mills and finally Punalur Paper Mills in 1931 as managements changed. It boasted the India Security Press at Nasik among its clientele at that time.

The bungalow, with 15 rooms, had glass pane windows. Natives called it the “kannadi (glass) bungalow.” The majestic structure stood on the side of the erstwhile Shengottai-Thiruvananthapuram road. Shengottai, now in Tamil Nadu, was then part of the Travancore kingdom. The bungalow was the office complex of superintendents monitoring the reed harvest and its transportation in bullock carts to the paper mill, some 20 km away.

Following the declaration of the Wildlife Protection Act in 1972, the bungalow was taken over by the Forest Department and it later served as the survey office of the KIP when the dam was sanctioned. The dam was commissioned in 1984, but the bungalow had gone under water some time before that.

Senior citizens of the area who had seen the bungalow in its heydays say that the structure is still in immaculate condition. This they attribute to surkhi mortar with which it was built.

Fifty-year-old G. Thomaskutty, who resides near the dam, often passed the Kannadi bungalow as a teenager. The courtyard had plenty of guava and mango trees then, he recalls.

As the monsoon progresses, the Kannadi Bungalow will once more be inundated.",2013-05-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['bungalow', 'kannadi', 'resurfaces', 'dam', 'thirty', 'travancore', 'mills', 'inundated', 'water', 'paper', 'forest', 'structure', 'windows', 'colonial']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
221,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought doesn't cause famine. People do. - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-27/drought-doesnt-cause-famine-people-do,"A woman waits to be registered prior to a food distribution by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Thonyor, Leer state, South Sudan.

The United Nations announced this month that more than 20 million people in four countries are teetering on the edge of famine, calling the situation “the worst humanitarian crisis” since the end of World War II.

The key for avoiding the worst outcomes? Political will, experts say.

Modern famines are different from those the world faced 60 to 70 years ago. In the past, with less warning and less international support, more people died from hunger. In the early and mid-20th century, famines killed millions in Europe and Asia, in areas with much larger populations than areas which suffer from food insecurity today.

According to estimates from the World Peace Foundation, the deadliest famine in recorded history actually did take place after World War II. During China’s Great Leap Forward, about 30 million people died from hunger between 1958 and 1962.

What explains the UN's statement, then? They may be counting famines by decade, which would have split the Great Leap Forward crisis between the 1950s and the 1960s:

These days, famines cause death by the thousands, and are mostly confined to the Horn of Africa. Improvements in transportation and communications infrastructure have been successful in eliminating large-scale famines in virtually all other parts of the world.

But the current situations in Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria and South Sudan are undeniably harsh.

“Those people will suffer, their children will be malnourished, they will likely be displaced, lose their livelihoods, and some people will no doubt die as a result of this crisis,” says Dan Maxwell, a food security professor and director of the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University.

Maxwell exphasizes that modern-day famines are rarely caused by a lack of food. “There has never been a case that agricultural production causes famine alone,” he says. “It only causes a famine if someone lets it cause a famine.”

And that's where data become especially important. Measuring early indicators is crucial for averting famine, as is early investment. In its March announcement, the UN asked for $4.4 billion in emergency funding for intervention, and released $22 million in an emergency loan to Somalia on March 21.

“If we get to the point where a famine is declared, it’s essentially indicating a failure on the part of the international community,” explains Chris Hillbruner of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, or FEWS NET.

So, how do we measure the warning signs?

FEWS NET uses the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) 5-point rating system, which rates areas around the world to signal how serious food insecurity is there. The ratings go from ""minimal"" to ""stressed, crisis, emergency and famine.""

The scale, developed in 2006 and updated in 2012, is in use in 25 countries and gives a consistent measure for food insecurity.

“There should be a response at phase 3 and phase 4,” Hillbruner said. “Phase 4 is where people start dying because of food insecurity. If one waits until famine and then starts responding, inevitably it will be too late.”

To declare a famine, at least 20 percent of households surveyed in an area must face lack of food, and more than 30 percent of children in an area have to have a weight that is recorded as dangerously low. If you don’t have data that says that, you can’t declare famine even if people are starving.

The situation in Yemen is the largest food insecurity emergency in the world right now, according to FEWS NET. Seven governorates there are classified as phase 4. An estimated 17 million people, or 60 percent of the population, are food insecure.

In South Sudan, about 4.9 million are estimated to be food insecure and that number will climb to 5.5 million by July. Five counties are classified at 4 and 5 and will worsen.

FEWS NET officials struggle to access parts of Nigeria, and reported in December that a famine likely occurred in Bama and Banki towns and the surrounding rural areas in 2016.

In Somalia, 400,000 people are in IPC phase 4 and face starvation; 5.2 million others are in phases 2 and 3. It is facing its third famine in the past 25 years, including one in 2011 which left 260,000 people dead.

Hunger is a political issue

Maxwell says there’s a common misconception among the public that overpopulation and lack of resources are the main drivers behind food insecurity. (It’s a theory that was put forth by Thomas Malthus nearly two centuries ago.) In other words, that people starve because there's not enough food.

But Emily Farr, Emergency Food Security and Vulnerable Livelihoods team leader at Oxfam, says that's not the underlying problem. “We are talking about situations that are caused by human behavior,” she says.

The Horn of Africa region, where hunger is worst, is also prone to drought — but the impacts of climate change alone are not enough to create famine, experts say, so long as they are managed.

Farr emphasizes that fast-acting humanitarian response is important for mitigating famines, although the data can be hard to come by.

“There have been cases in the past where we haven’t been able to declare food insecurity as much as it was because we simply didn’t have the data,” Farr says.

Conflict especially can limit access. In South Sudan, for example, violence has claimed the lives of at least 12 aid workers this year and as many as 79 since 2013.

Innovations in technology, such as the World Food Program’s Mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping project, which uses cellphones to survey food security, can help fill in missing numbers. FEWS NET employs high resolution satellite imagery to estimate crop production and population displacement patterns.

Fundamentally, Hillbruner of FEWS NET describes famine as a humanitarian and political issue.

“I think there are times when it’s overstated that there are places we can’t get any information,” he said. “But when the political will is there, everyone suddenly has access.”

Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect the difference between populations in famine (IPC stage 4) and those facing severe food insecurity (IPC phases 2 and 3).

8,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"For groundwater, local management proves effective - California Farm Bureau",https://www.agalert.com/story/?id=7007,"For groundwater, local management proves effective

As the state Legislature considers statewide groundwater legislation in the midst of a severe drought, water agencies and water users say local groundwater management has yielded sustainable and positive results.

""Recent discussions may have left people with the impression that California has no groundwater management, but dozens of local and regional plans are in place and work well,"" said Danny Merkley, California Farm Bureau Federation director of water resources.

Current law enables local entities or agencies to implement their own groundwater basin management solutions and strategies. Local management falls into three main categories: special act districts, created through an act of legislation; county groundwater ordinances adopted by local agencies; and court adjudications, where groundwater rights are determined by a court.

For example, the Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District—a special act district—has collected groundwater data since it was formed more than 60 years ago. Special act districts operate under different rules and processes, based on local needs. The Yolo County district was formed at the request of county supervisors and created by the Legislature with the purpose of finding new water sources and managing them efficiently.

Tim O'Halloran, general manager for the district, said its data collection efforts give well owners ""a snapshot twice a year of how their groundwater is doing, a trend over time,"" which allows development of sophisticated, conjunctive water programs that assure sustainable groundwater use.

Effective groundwater management comes from working through the issues collaboratively and locally, he said.

""If an outsider comes in and takes the data, by the time it is processed, it may or may not make sense and they won't have the context to evaluate the data,"" O'Halloran said.

Another special act district, the Sierra Valley Groundwater Management District, was established in 1980 after irrigators became concerned about increased drilling of new wells.

Jim Roberti, a director of the Sierraville-based district, said the district was established to prevent export of water.

""The major goal of the forming of the district has been achieved and the water has been allowed to stay in the valley for the people that live here,"" he said.

Roberti said landowners are required to purchase a meter for any wells with a flow rate of more than 100 gallons per minute. The district owns and maintains the meters, with data collected monthly.

Management of aquifers is also achieved through the use of local groundwater ordinances adopted by local agencies.

The Butte County Department of Water and Resource Conservation was formed in 1999.

""Butte County started this county water and natural resource department because there were transfers taking place and the residents felt there should be a little more oversight, so the county passed an initiative that restricts transferring surface water and pumping groundwater,"" said Les Heringer, farm manager at M&T Ranch in Chico. ""Since the county started this, it has functioned very well.""

Paul Gosselin, the director of the county department, said Butte County has more than one ordinance that guides groundwater, such as a groundwater management plan and a well-spacing ordinance to ensure that agricultural wells do not interfere with each other.

""It is pretty complex with groundwater flows, surface water flows and the interaction with surface and groundwater, and then how much land use affects either surface-water use or groundwater use,"" Gosselin said.

Butte County has a network of wells that are monitored quarterly, plus additional wells dedicated for groundwater monitoring, with data reported publicly. Landowner volunteers are asked to assist with groundwater monitoring.

""We've had extraordinary involvement and public participation and willingness by landowners to do monitoring and help study the basin,"" Gosselin said. ""The people at the local level did this from the grassroots up because of their understanding and appreciation of the importance of groundwater and what that means for the community, agriculture and the environment.""

A third form of groundwater management is through court adjudication, in which groundwater rights are determined by a court, including how much groundwater well owners can extract and who serves as watermaster to ensure the basin is managed.

John Martin, general manager of the Tehachapi-Cummings County Water District in Tehachapi, said the district has three adjudicated basins.

""Because of the fact that the groundwater is limited and the safe yield is very small, we have an informal arrangement with the farmers that they don't take more than half of their total water needs from the ground and that they get at least half from our (surface) water supply,"" Martin said. ""They have been complying with that for quite a number of years and by doing that, the basin is staying well below the court-determined safe yield.""

The Tehachapi-Cummings district, which acts as the court-appointed watermaster, meters agricultural wells that take monthly readings and groundwater elevations, and people are notified when the supply is getting out of balance.

Merkley said Farm Bureau and other agricultural organizations have been urging the Legislature to move deliberately in considering statewide groundwater legislation. He noted that some groundwater basins face supply-demand challenges, but that examples of successful local programs could ""provide a path for others to follow"" in coming years.

""The complexities of groundwater, groundwater management and interactions with surface water are simply too great to rush to complete an isolated solution,"" he said. ""We recommend a carefully thought-through process to develop appropriate protections of our groundwater resources for future generations.""

Butte County farmer Heringer put it this way: ""One size does not fit all in this state regarding groundwater. Every groundwater basin is different in the state, so local oversight is much better than having somebody from the state come in and tell us how to manage it.""

620,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought a 'grave concern' - The Phnom Penh Post,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/drought-grave-concern,"Local communities in the Kingdom’s rural areas have expressed grave concerns over the severe lack of water amid a prolonged drought. CHAIWAT SUBPRASOM/REUTERS/THE STRAITS TIMES

Drought a ‘grave concern’

Local communities in rural areas across the Kingdom have expressed grave concerns over the severe lack of water for their daily consumption amid a prolonged drought that has caused streams, creeks, lakes and ponds to gradually dry up.

Due to high demand for water to increase their crop yields, farmers around the Trapaing Thma reservoir in Banteay Meanchey province have pumped water from the reservoir into their farms and in turn gradually drained the huge reservoir.

The issue has also caused concerns among researchers and conservationists who fear a lack of water and feeding grounds for rare wildlife and bird species and an adverse impact on biodiversity in the area.

San Sav Leang, a 56-year-old resident from Samrong commune in Oddar Meanchey province’s Samrong town, told The Post that most people in the commune do not have enough water to use as all lakes in the area have already dried up.

“In my commune, a number of lakes and streams have already dried out. Today, the authority distributed clean water for our daily use, but it is still not enough because there are many people in the area,” he said.

In the province’s Anlong Veng commune, more than 600 families representing the O’Romchek communities have sought intervention by calling on the water resource authority to build a dam in their community as the water body in their area had run dry.

Seth Sambor, a representative of Romchek II village, appealed for a speedy intervention.

“We need a dam to preserve water for use in the dry season that could cover over 1,000ha of paddy fields. This year, we don’t have enough water for rice fields during the dry season. I hope there will be a water solution for my community next year,” he said.

Provincial Water Resources and Meteorology Department director Nen Kuon told The Post on Tuesday: “We’ve studied and prepared a dam project in the area to address their concerns, but it would not be as fast as they want,” he said.

Since the beginning of this month, some villages in eight provinces including Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Thom, Koh Kong, Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey, Stung Treng and Prey Veng have faced water shortage, said Keo Vy, the National Committee for Disaster Management spokesman.

“Over 17,000ha of paddy fields have been damaged while some villages and communes in the provinces are running short of clean water for daily consumption,” he said.

Ly Sarum, a representative of the Prambei Mom forestry community at Prambei Mom commune in Kampong Speu province’s Thpong district, said nearly 100 bantengs on his 97ha of community forest land are in dire need of water and feed.

“The people in our communities want to dig two big ponds to supply water for themselves and wildlife in the area, but we don’t have enough money to do it,” he said.

Ken Sereyrotha, the country director of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), told The Post on Tuesday that irrigation projects including ponds, streams and lakes should be built in urban areas.

“If we add new ponds or restore irrigation systems such as streams and lakes in natural forests that serve as wildlife sanctuaries, forestry crimes will increase as poachers are omnipresent while the number of environmental rangers is limited,” he said.",2019-02-27 08:00:00+00:00,"['concern', 'provinces', 'water', 'meanchey', 'concerns', 'drought', 'ponds', 'grave', 'commune', 'streams', 'wildlife', 'lakes', 'area']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
384,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Farmers in war-torn Afghanistan hit by worst drought in decades - Phys.Org,https://phys.org/news/2018-08-farmers-war-torn-afghanistan-worst-drought.html,"A girl carries containers to collect water on the outskirts of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, where a lack of snow and rain in recent months has badly hit the harvest, sparking warnings of severe food shortages

After his wheat crop failed and wells dried up, Ghulam Abbas sold his animals and joined thousands of other farmers migrating to cities as Afghanistan's worst drought in living memory ravages the war-torn country.

A huge shortfall in snow and rain across much of the country over the normally wet colder months decimated the winter harvest, threatening the already precarious livelihoods of millions of farmers and sparking warnings of severe food shortages.

Like hundreds of farming families in Charkint village in the normally fertile northern province of Balkh, Abbas, 45, has moved with 11 family members to the provincial capital Mazar-i-Sharif to find work.

""I don't remember a drought as severe as this year's,"" Abbas, who has been a farmer for more than three decades, told AFP.

""We never had to leave our village or sell our animals because of a drought in the past.""

As dry conditions and high temperatures persist, there are growing concerns about the spring and summer crops that will be harvested later this year.

Afghanistan's 2018 wheat harvest is already expected to be the lowest since at least 2011, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, set up by USAID in 1985.

Faced with an estimated shortfall of 2.5 million tonnes of wheat this year, more than two million people could become ""severely food insecure"" and would be in ""desperate need"" of humanitarian assistance in the next six months, the United Nations has warned.

Tens of thousands of sheep and goats have died and many farmers have eaten the seeds for the next planting season, as rivers and wells dry up and pastures turn to dust.

""If the authorities and the international community don't step up to this challenge now, Afghanistan could face a calamity as we head into the next winter,"" UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan Toby Lanzer told AFP recently.

But thousands of farmers like Abbas have already given up hope, abandoning their land and moving their families to towns and cities to survive.

The UN estimates more than 70,000 people have been displaced to urban areas due to the drought.

""Three years ago it rained and snowed well in our village,"" Abbas said.

""The crops yielded well and I made more than 300,000 afs (afghanis, or nearly $4,300). But this year, even though I sold my sheep and goats, I made less than 100,000 afs (about $1,400).""

Not enough help

The lack of precipitation in Balkh has left most of its farming and grazing land parched, Zabiullah Zoobin, provincial director of crops and cultivation management, told AFP recently.

More than 450,000 farmers and nomadic herders in the province have slaughtered their cattle, goats and sheep, or sold them for a pittance, he added.

""All villagers are wondering what to do with their livestock and how to keep them alive because that is all they have in life,"" Haji Sorab, a sheep and goat herder in Dawlat Abad district, told AFP.

The drought adds to Afghanistan's woes as its security forces struggle to beat back Taliban and Islamic State militants, and civilian casualties remain at record levels.

Agriculture is the backbone of the Afghan economy. Nearly 15 million people are employed in the sector in the 20 provinces worst affected by the drought, according to the UN.

With already high unemployment made worse by record numbers of Afghans returning from Iran and many more internally displaced by the conflict, their chances of finding other work are grim.

Prices of sheep and goats have plunged as farmers rush to sell their animals before they become even weaker, agriculture and livestock ministry spokesman Akbar Rustami told AFP.

At the same time, the cost of fodder has soared. Rustami said most of the country's livestock are in ""urgent need of food"".

Afghan authorities have so far provided limited assistance to farmers and international aid agencies are struggling to meet the growing demand.

UN food and other assistance has reached more than 460,000 people in drought-affected provinces in recent months, Lanzer said—less than a quarter of those who need it.

An agreement between international agencies and the Afghan government to release 60,000 tonnes of wheat currently held in the country's strategic grain reserve and turn it into mineral-fortified flour will help.

""It won't be enough for what is needed, but it's a very good start,"" Lanzer said.

If much-needed aid does not reach farmers soon, more might turn to more drought-resistant crops such as opium poppies, Abbas warned.

Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, despite billions of dollars being spent on counternarcotics efforts since the US-led invasion in 2001.

""A government which is hardly able to pay its soldiers to fight cannot reach out to help people in these remote areas,"" Abbas said.

""The conditions will eventually force people to turn to illegal crops.""

It wasn’t the fighting, though, that forced him leave his home in western Afghanistan.

Instead, he is seeking shelter from a devastating drought that has ruined his livelihood.

A prolonged lack of rain and dissipating groundwater destroyed his fields and killed his livestock, prompting Qayoom to move with his wife and their eight children to the western city of Herat from their village in neighboring Badghis Province.

Speaking with Radio Free Afghanistan from his temporary home in Dasht-e Shaidayee on the outskirts of Herat, he described how the drought disrupted their lives and eventually forced them to leave their village, Sharshar.

“We were forced to leave because there was no water. All wells and the springs dried up,” he said. “We could not farm our lands because of the lack of rain. I had cows and sheep, but they died because there was no grass or pasture.”

When the cattle began to die, the price per cow dropped from $1,400 to just under $300, and it was difficult to find a buyer for a sheep for under $30.

Qayoom is one of the 5,000 families that local authorities say have sought refuge in Herat during the past month. All fled their villages in the nearby provinces of Badghis, Ghor, and Faryab.

Just recently a UN office warned that this year’s drought has affected Afghanistan’s 20 provinces including Badghis, Uruzgan, and Jawzjan.

In its report released in May, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA) said that “this drought will have a particularly detrimental effect on already chronically food insecure farming households.”

UNOCHA estimates that out of approximately 2.2 million people affected by the drought, at least 1.4 million will become acutely food insecure. They will require emergency assistance over the coming months and into the next lean season, the report said.

“We are concerned that the poorest cohort of Afghan society, particularly those already displaced by conflict, will be worst affected,” said Christopher Nyamandi, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) country director in Afghanistan.

“Displaced people affected by the drought are prevented from reaching markets and aid due to the ongoing armed conflict,” he added.

A survey conducted by the NRC in January found that “one in two displaced Afghans said they could not adequately feed their families and were often skipping meals.” This figure is an increase from one in three six years ago.

A June 4 statement by the NRC noted that regional differences are stark. “One in four respondents in conflict-affected [southern] Kandahar and [eastern] Nangarhar provinces say they had suffered hunger over the past year, compared with one in six in Kabul,” it said.

Janan Kochi is a nomad and a livestock herder in Charchino district of southern Uruzgan Province. Speaking with Radio Free Afghanistan, he said nomads have been devastated by this year's drought.

“The Kochis have been affected very badly,” he said. “We spent the winter and spring without rain. There is no grass in the mountains nor in the desserts.”

In northern Jawzjan Province, residents have similar concerns.

Shukrullah, 50, a local farmer, has been recently displaced from the Qush-Teppa district. He now lives in a rundown house in the provincial capital, Sheberghan, together with his wife and their five daughters.

“We planted some 700 kilograms of wheat seeds, but our crop was destroyed by a lack of rain,” he said. “I lost my cows, sheep, and chickens, as well, which prompted me to move to the city.”

Najib Aqa Fahim, head of the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, says his country is experiencing the peak of a drought.

“Thirteen million Afghans in 20 provinces [out of a total 34] are affected by drought,” he told journalists on June 3. “Out of these, 1 million people and 3 million livestock are in urgent need of food and water.”

Earlier, the Afghan Agriculture and Livestock Ministry said it is working on a $100 million plan to help the drought-stricken communities during the next two months.

Despite these pledges, Qayoom says his family has received little assistance.

“All I need is food and a shelter to live my life. I just don’t want to die from hunger and the hot weather,” he said.",2018-06-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['sheep', 'food', 'livestock', 'hit', 'drought', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'affected', 'nrc', 'twothirds', 'provinces', 'rain', 'qayoom']",Afghanistan,news article,English
566,Drought Sri Lanka,Cloud seeding bears no rain in Sri Lanka - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2019/04/when-cloud-seeding-bears-no-rain/,"An experimental attempt by Sri Lanka to induce artificial rain amid a prolonged drought fell short of expectations when the anticipated rain materialized a day late.

Despite the setback, the government appears committed to exploring the technology further as it seeks to address power cuts caused by low water levels in its hydropower reservoirs.

Scientists have called for comprehensive studies on cloud microphysics, meteorology and observational studies to ensure that such an expensive endeavor is backed by adequate scientific data.

With no cost-benefit analysis, climatologists fear that artificial rainmaking may cause adverse impacts over the long term.

A recent attempt to induce rain amid a prolonged drought in Sri Lanka has fallen short, but that hasn’t stopped the government from embracing the project, to the dismay of scientists who have urged greater studies into the technology and its long-term impacts.

The drought conditions have brought soaring temperatures and regular power cuts in a country where about 8 percent of electricity comes from hydropower. These conditions have frayed the public mood, and the power crisis is expected to continue as water levels in the hydropower reservoirs remain low.

To trigger rains in the catchment areas that feed the dams, the government recently carried out an rainmaking experiment. Though it recorded only marginal success, with the results now under review, the government is looking to adopt the technology as part of its long-term solutions, including creating a department for artificial rainmaking under the Ministry of Power and Energy.

“We require more rain to meet the country’s hydropower requirement,” Sulakshana Jayawardena, spokesman for the Ministry of Power and Energy and Business Development, told Mongabay.

He said Sri Lanka had experienced severe drought conditions in the past two years, with many catchment areas not receiving adequate rain to generate sufficient hydropower. Jayawardena said the reservoirs were only filled up to about 50 percent of their capacity.

“We had to explore artificial rainmaking. The annual average rainfall of 2,000 mm [79 inches] is completely insufficient to meet the demand for power,” he said.

And the electricity board is keen to avoid the costly exercise of thermal power generation, which accounts for 91 percent of the country’s electricity. Just under half of that comes from burning coal, with the rest from oil. “When there’s limited capacity to generate hydropower, we resort to expensive power purchasing from the private sector,” Jayawardena said. “Besides being expensive, it does not offer a long-term solution.”

Jayawardena said generating thermal power cost the state about 12 times as much as hydropower per unit of energy. As such, the government is likely to pursue more rainmaking exercises, he said.

But the failed attempt at rainmaking has drawn criticism, with experts calling for scientific assessments before long-term programs are envisaged.

Lareef Zubair, a climate scientist dubbed artificial rainmaking an “unproven technology,” and called for comprehensive research on cloud microphysics, meteorology and observational studies.

“Let’s first take a holistic look at things,” he said.

An expert committee that looked into the rainmaking initiative has called for a better monitoring system and catchment conservation, before making big decisions. Concerns have also been expressed abut poor management of rainfall, with experts saying that Sri Lanka has failed to make maximum use of rain received.

Ranjith Punyawardene, principal climatologist at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya has also called for a complete cost-benefit analysis coupled with an environmental impact assessment before undertaking any expensive rainmaking exercise.

Meanwhile, Kapila Jayasinghe, chief engineer of the state-owned utility, Ceylon Electricity Board, ruled out any long-term side effects from cloud triggering, citing a past attempt at artificial rainmaking in the 1980s.

“The initial feasibility has been concluded and now it is about making a national plan and implementing it,” he said.

Late rain

The rainmaking experiment took place March 22, with a Sri Lanka Air Force plane spraying chemicals onto clouds above the Maussakelle reservoir in Central province.

The previous month, a team had been sent to study artificial rainmaking at Thailand’s Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation, comprising officials from the Air Force, the CEB, and the departments of meteorology and irrigation.

During the experiment, assisted by engineers from Thailand, the rainmakers expected an artificially created downpour over the catchment area later the same day. However, rainfall observed from satellites and in the nearby area of Norwood indicated that the rain occurred the following day, March 23.

The Thai experts determined it was still possible to generate artificial rain in Sri Lanka, provided certain environmental conditions were met, top sources from the energy ministry told Mongabay. The source said the team working on the technology had been sent back to the drawing board to gather more atmospheric data before more experiments can be carried out.

Meanwhile, Buddhi Marambe, professor of crop science at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya and chairperson, national experts committee on climate adaptation said there should be sufficient checks and balances if rainmaking is to become a long-term program to address the island’s energy crisis.

Marambe told Mongabay that it is important to further study rainmaking, if the country intends continuing with more experiments.

“If the experiments continue, then certain types of chemicals commonly used for rainmaking, are likely to impact soil and plants. The process also creates cumulonimbus, known as ‘rain clouds.’ Triggering such clouds is expected to trigger high intensity rainfall. This could result in increasing rainfall in the catchment areas but likely to also result in severe soil erosion in the same areas due to the intensity,” he said.

1566,FL-2020-000038-EGY,Egypt wishes to resume Ethiopian dam negotiations holding onto water rights fundamentals: min. - Egypttoday,https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/100121/Egypt-wishes-to-resume-Ethiopian-dam-negotiations-holding-onto-water,"CAIRO – 25 March 2021: Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mohamed Abdel Aty asserted Wednesday Egypt's desire to resume the negotiations on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) while holding onto the fundamentals it adopts to preserve its water rights.

The minister's statements came in his speech while presiding over a seminar titled ""The Water Future of Egypt: Opportunities and Challenges"" jointly organized by Canada-Egypt Business Council and the Egyptian Business Council for International Cooperation.

The minister presented the updates on the issue stressing that the Ethiopian Dam and its impact on Nile water compose one of the biggest challenges faced by Egypt. That is particularly in light of the unilateral measures taken by Ethiopia in terms of reservoir filling and dam operation. Abdel Aty warned against the massive repercussions that will not be accepted by Egypt.

The minister underlined that Egypt supports development in fellow African states and Nile Basin countries. Examples of such support is embodied in building a number of dams that harvest rainwater; underground water treatment plants and supply networks powered by solar energy serving remote communities; flood management projects; river harbors; fisheries, and, cleaning canals.

That is in addition to contributing to the preparation of studies necessary to establish dams that would secure water and generate electricity as well as offering training and capacity-building opportunities to technical cadres in Nile Basin countries.

Abdel Aty pointed out that water challenges require Egypt to deploy efforts on both the governmental and societal levels. On one hand, the government shall implement a number of large projects in the sector. On the other hand, there is a need to raise people's awareness on water rationalization and preservation from pollution.

On the legislative level, Abdel Aty indicated that the House of Representatives is examining a draft bill on efficient water management, and elimination of water-related violations.

The Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources noted earlier in March in a statement that it had accomplished the lining of 1,188 kilometers of canals across Egypt.

Currently, the ministry is lining further 4,312 kilometers while allocations to line 1,452 kilometers have been endorsed so they would be offered to contractors in tenders soon.

The target for the first phase ending in 2022 and worth LE18 billion is lining 7,000 kilometers of canals.

The canal lining project is part of the National Project for Developing the Egyptian Countryside aimed at raising the quality of life of residents of rural areas. The lining of canals would enhance water management and distribution, ensure the delivery of water to the ends of canals, and inhibit pollution.

On another level, the ministry is encouraging farmers to substitute modern irrigation systems for flood irrigation in order to rationalize water use. Modern irrigation systems have been introduced in 230,000 feddans and will be introduced in further 55,000 feddans as requested by agricultural land owners.

The ministry attributes demand by farmers on modern irrigation systems to the desire of lowering costs, and improving the productivity and quality of crops.",2021-03-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['min', 'modern', 'wishes', 'water', 'egypt', 'lining', 'fundamentals', 'aty', 'rights', 'irrigation', 'ethiopian', 'nile', 'kilometers', 'holding', 'resume', 'systems', 'minister', 'negotiations']",Egypt,news article,English

That's what the followers thought of their leader's pedestrian humour. A leader who happens to be the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra: Ajit Pawar.But here's how his critics and many within the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) itself, describe him. Arrogant. Power-hungry. Unsophisticated. And now - two additions: Crass and Heartless.Water. That's all that Bhaiyya Deshmukh, a poor farmer from Solapur - one of the worst drought-hit districts in Maharashtra - was demanding, sitting on his nearly two-month long protest at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. But Mr Pawar thought it was fine to ridicule and mock a demand that not only Mr Deshmukh but millions of Maharashtrians are making. The same hapless citizens who have lost their crops and have been forced to beg for water as the state struggles to tackle what's claimed to be the ""worst drought since 1972"". ( Watch So where does this ""I-am-King-you-are-Slave"" attitude spring from? Feared by most and disliked by many within his own party, junior Pawar has largely himself and his brash style of politics to blame. Those close to him claim, his ""no-nonsense"" temperament and frankness are misinterpreted as ""arrogance"". But his propaganda team tom-toms this brashness as an asset, comparing him with Raj Thackeray. (The irony is that the masses love it too. Remember Bal Thackeray? His speeches were laced with the choicest of Marathi-abuses.)Others insist, intoxicated by power, the 53-year-old, no longer enjoys an easy relationship with his uncle, the super-shrewd Sharad Pawar. No wonder he also doesn't get along with Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan or even many of the senior members of his own party, the NCP.As Ajit Pawar nurses his political dreams, what he fears most is the 'shame' of failure. It was largely under his leadership that Rs 70,000 crores were spent on irrigation projects which yielded little relief from the acute water scarcity. The media, activists and the opposition all screamed of a scam and he resigned from his post only to be re-instated after a farcical white paper ""cleared"" him. He also holds the Finance portfolio and the state today is reeling under a staggering debt which is nearing Rs 3 lakh crores.This ugly new ""crude"" tag will stick to the man, but despite this current outrage and his failures, Mr Pawar will get re-elected in 2014. And he knows that. We chose the man we really deserve.But just a reminder: to have some finesse in speech, to be able to converse also in English, to have a genuine interest in arts and culture and a mind refined enough for intellectual debates, are not qualities the electorate are hoping to see in our politicians. Anyway, Ajit Pawar does not really aspire to all of the above.If senior Pawar once dreamed of being India's Prime Minister, junior Pawar fancies himself as the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra.Back at the rally, the neta raises the pitch.""I have also come to know that since there is a shortage of electricity, the population is increasing.

961,Drought Sri Lanka,White Ferns poised to break World Cup drought - Stuff.co.nz,http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/8243286/White-Ferns-poised-to-break-World-Cup-drought,"CAPTAIN'S KNOCK: Suzie Bates scores an unbeaten hundred to lead her team to victory over Australia.

Captain Suzie Bates says her White Ferns are in ""a good place"" ahead of their women's 50-over cricket World Cup opener against South Africa in Cuttack, India, tomorrow.

New Zealand brushed aside Monday's surprise hammering by India to topple world champions England by 13 runs in yesterday's final warmup match and confirm themselves as contenders for a first cup triumph since 2000.

They headed for India buoyed by a 2-1 Twenty20 series win over Australia in Melbourne, their first series victory on Australian soil for 26 years, and are confident of breaking up the England-Australia dominance during the past eight years.

Though India showed on Monday that they will be a handful on their home turf, and the West Indies are also now a major threat in the women's game, that confidence will remain intact following a rare win over England.

New Zealand posted 223 all out in 50 overs, with Sara McGlashan scoring 88 from 90 balls and Lucy Doolan 57 from 77, and held their nerve to dismiss the tournament favourites for 210 in the 49th over.

""To beat England, who are a very strong side, was really impressive and it puts us in a good place heading into the World Cup,"" Bates said, describing the tune-up win as ""massive"".

""If we'd had two losses, we would've been a bit more nervous, but with our batters scoring runs and bowlers executing, we are really confident going into our first pool game.""

With the 9am starts, Bates said the first 10 overs were tricky for the team batting first, while the wickets had taken plenty of turn later in the day, so playing late and negotiating spin would be crucial for the batsmen.

New Zealand have been something of a third wheel in women's cricket when it comes to major tournaments during the past eight years, with England winning the last 50-over World Cup, in 2009, as well as the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in the same year, while Australia won the previous 50-over World Cup, in 2005, and have won the last two T20 World Cups, in 2010 and 2012.

New Zealand have become accustomed to the bridesmaid's tag, having lost three finals (one 50-over and two T20s) in the space of two years in 2009 and 2010.

But there is genuine belief among the New Zealand team that they can win for the first time since 2000.

""There's very little separating the top teams at this level, so it's very much going to be about sticking to our game plan and our strengths and how people cope with the pressure. We believe we can win at the World Cup,"" said coach Katrina Keenan.

Runs from the experienced Bates and left-hander Amy Satterthwaite at the top of the order will be vital for New Zealand, as will Sophie Devine's hitting power in the middle order. There are few better strikers in the world.

As well, all-rounder Nicola Browne, who also has few problems finding the boundary, looms as influential.

The slower bowlers are expected to be prominent in India and New Zealand have a few handy ones, most notably Morna Nielsen who bowled well in Australia.

New Zealand will also face Pakistan and Australia in group B before the Super Sixes playoff stage.

Group A is headed by England and includes India, the West Indies and Sri Lanka.

1107,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,'Urgent action needed for countries in Southern Africa threatened by drought' - Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre,https://climatecentre.org/news/1210/a-urgent-action-needed-for-countries-in-southern-africa-threatened-by-droughta,"‘Urgent action needed for countries in Southern Africa threatened by drought’

(Dr Michael Charles heads the IFRC Southern Africa Cluster. His article was first published by the Southern Times last month, before the September Climate Action Summit in New York, and was reproduced by the IFRC on Friday. It has been edited slightly here for length and time references.)



All countries in the Southern African Development Community are currently experiencing pockets of dryness. Worryingly for the sub-region, Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have declared state of emergencies due to looming drought.



The Climate Action Summit in New York presented a timely opportunity for urgent global discussions that will hopefully culminate in concrete, realistic plans to address the disproportionate impacts of climate change on developing countries.



Southern Africa is one of the regions most affected by serious impacts of climate-induced natural disasters.



This year alone, a succession of cyclones and floods has already resulted in significant loss of life and assets in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and kept humanitarian organizations busy with emergency responses, as well as recovery and rebuilding efforts.

Countries are acting to decrease their response times

and improve their communities’ readiness

to mitigate impacts of natural disasters

Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth were different in that they managed to attract global attention because they caused significant devastation during a short period.



Climate change-induced natural disasters in Southern Africa are often invisible in the global media, even though they are protracted and threaten the livelihoods of millions.



Even lower-level cyclones can cause devastating floods that are quickly followed by debilitating droughts.



Many national economies in Southern Africa are agriculturally based, and as long as climate change mitigation strategies enshrined in existing global policies are not wholeheartedly implemented, a significant portion of the 340 million inhabitants of Southern Africa could be food-insecure.



Increased mass movement of people from areas affected by climate-induced natural disasters is also more likely.



The effects of food insecurity and mass movements are felt most by the vulnerable in our communities, such as the chronically ill and disabled, and women and children.



They also place immense pressure on already strained health systems in many countries in the sub-region. With the necessary funds, the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement has the capability and is well placed to address some of the consequences. But urgent action is still needed on the climate change question.



Protocol



Efforts for adaptation are essential not only to decrease the negative consequences but also to increase opportunities for communities to be more resilient in the long-term.



Countries in the sub-region are acting to decrease their response times to calamities and improve their communities’ readiness to mitigate impacts of natural disasters.



Mozambique is the first country in Africa to have an early action protocol approved; it harnesses the power of forecast-based financing to ensure that humanitarian responses are more proactive. Malawi’s protocol is under review and Zambia’s is currently in development.



The need for humanitarian assistance in Southern Africa in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020 will be greater with the imminent drought.

There's a lot to play for in AFC Cup as the big names take to the field on Tuesday and Wednesday...

Asia's secondary club competition is about to witness yet another vital round of matches in the South, Central, East and ASEAN Zones on Tuesday and Wednesday. While several groups will see matchday five, some are only in their third round of matches. As such, let's take a peek at what awaits us in the coming days.

GROUP D (CENTRAL ZONE)

Dordoi FC (KGZ) v Altyn Asyr (TKM): Kyrgyz Republic's Dordoi FC will have nothing but a win on their minds when they host Turkmenistan's Altyn Asyr on Tuesday in Bishkek. Dordoi will be pumped up after defeating FC Alay 1-0 in the previous round, which has propelled them to three points, one below joint-leaders Istiklol and Altyn Asyr. As such a win could see them stake claim to progress from this round.

Altyn Asyr might be the fancied side in this tie but after a listless draw against FC Istiklol in the previous round, they have to get going from the outset. A win will be the bare minimum they will want too.

Venue: Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, Bishkek

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+6

AFC Cup: West Zone preview

FC Istiklol (TJK) v FC Alay (KGZ): Tajikistan's FC Istiklol host bottom-placed side FC Alay on Tuesday, looking to surge clear at the top of the table. Though Istiklol played out a 1-1 draw against Altyn Asyr in the last round, the 2015 runners-up are the favourites to gain all three points against a struggling FC Alay who are yet to notch a point in the tournament.

There are some scares for the teams with Istiklol without the suspended Romish Dzhalilov while FC Alay do not have the services of Murolimzhon Akhmedov for the same reason. Will FC Alay pull off a surprise? We'll have to wait and watch.

Venue: Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, Bishkek

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+6

GROUP E (SOUTH ZONE)

Bengaluru FC (IND) v Abahani Limited Dhaka (BAN): Last year's runners-up Bengaluru FC have the perfect opportunity to extend their lead atop Group E when they host Bangladesh's Abahani Limited Dhaka on Tuesday. After downing Mohun Bagan in the opening round, they had to rely on an injury-time goal to overcome Maziya S&RC in Maldives in the previous round. They had a good outing domestically as well over the weekend and will be buoyed as a result as they take on Abahani.

The Bangladeshi team, however, are without a point after two back-to-back defeats in the tournament. They could fall well beyond having any realistic chances of progression if they lose against Bengaluru.

Know Bengaluru's Rivals: Abahani Ltd

Mohun Bagan (IND) v Maziya Sports & Recreation (MDV): Mohun Bagan host Maziya S&RC in Kolkata on Tuesday in a crucial Group E encounter. Both teams have a win in their kitty and have three points each. As a result, an adverse result or a draw could see them fall off the pace with Bengaluru poised to move further forward, barring an upset against Abahani.

Mohun Bagan have been winning games domestically without playing at their best and are chasing the I-League title. As such, their attention could be towards the domestic league which is something Maziya will look to exploit. This should be a tight game.

GROUP F (ASEAN ZONE)

Magwe (MYA) v Global FC (PHI): Philippine side Global FC stormed to the top of the table in the last round with a victory over Johor Darul Ta'zim and now they are in a position where they can be assured of a top-two finish with a point against Myanmar's Global FC who are placed bottom in the group. Global FC have nine points from four games and have been quietly impressive in the group so far. A win will put them in pole position to secure a win with just one more game remaining.

Magwe, meanwhile, will know that anything less than a win will see them crash out of the tournament. With just two draws so far in their kitty, they are not expected to put up much fight on Wednesday.

Venue: Youth Training Centre, Yangon

Kick-off: April 19, 15:30 UTC+6:30

Beoungket Angkor (CAM) v Johor Darul Ta’zim (MAS): Johor Darul Ta'zim will be desperate to get back to winning ways when they travel to Cambodia to take on Beoungket Angkor FC on Wednesday. Having been outsmarted by Global FC in the previous round, Johor need to win this tie. A Johor loss coupled with a win for Global would see the Philippine side win the group. Johor have been really inconsistent in the tournament so far and need to step up.

The Cambodians have four points from four fixtures and a surprise win against JDT will see them draw level with the Malaysian side but a loss will see them crash out. Anything can happen but for this game, JDT are the favourites.

Venue: National Olympic Stadium, Phnom Penh

Kick-off: April 19, 18:00 UTC+7

GROUP G (ASEAN ZONE)

Ceres Negros (PHI) v Hanoi FC (VIE): Group G is extremely compact at the top with just three points separating the top three teams. As such, surprise leaders Hanoi FC, who have eight points, will be looking to pull clear when they face Philippine side Ceres Negros who were defeated 3-0 by Felda United in the previous round. Hanoi can guarantee themselves the top spot with a win and a little help from Tampines Rovers against Felda United.

Ceres Negros will welcome back Manuel Ott from suspension but are without Martin Steuble as they look to mastermind a victory that will take them level on points with Hanoi. This round will be extremely important for the final outcome in the group.

Venue: Pana-ad Park and Football Stadium, Bacolod City

Kick-off: April 19, 19:30 UTC+8

Felda United (MAS) v Tampines Rovers (SIN): A rejuvenated Felda United are up against a struggling Tampines Rovers on Wednesday as they look to make up ground on group leaders Hanoi FC. Felda had just two points after the initial three rounds but a morale-boosting 3-0 win over Ceres Negros has put them back in the reckoning for progression from the group. But they need a positive result in this game.

Singapore's Tampines Rovers have just the three points to show for their efforts so far and were crippled by back-to-back defeats inflicted on them by Hanoi FC. Felda are the favourites on form but Tampines Rovers cannot be written off yet.

Venue: Tun Abdul Razak Stadium, Jengka

Kick-off: April 19, 20:45 UTC+8

GROUP H (ASEAN ZONE)

Home United (SIN) v Yadanarbon (MYA): Singapore's Home United are in pole position to win the three-team Group I, provided they defeat Myanmar's Yadanarbon on Tuesday. Having registered back-to-back wins over Than Quang Ninh after an opening round defeat to Yadanarbon, Home United sit atop the group with six points from three games while Yadanarbon have four points from two games.

The away team badly need a draw or a win even though they have another game against Than Quang Ninh and will draw inspiration from their opening game victory against the side from Singapore.

Venue: Jalan Besar Stadium, Singapore

GROUP I (EAST ZONE)

4.25 SC (PRK) v Kigwancha SC (PRK): It's a Pyongyang derby for the first time in the AFC Cup as 4.25 SC host Kigwancha SC in Group I on Tuesday. Having played a game each, both against Mongolian side Erchim FC, the two teams are joint top of the three-team group with a win each. 4.25 SC had the most sparkling of the wins - a 6-0 spanking at home with Kim Yu-song scoring an astounding five goals.

Kigwancha SC, on the other hand, hammered Erchim 3-0 away. As such, this game could very well have a big say in deciding the Group I winners. These two teams should unleash be a fascinating spectacle in Pyongyang.

107,DR-2015-000134-SOM,Thirsty Lima Uses Robust Planning to Address Its Future Water Needs - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/10/05/thirsty-lima-uses-robust-planning-to-address-its-future-water-needs,"When residents tell tourists that it never rains in Lima, they are a mere .3 inches from the truth. One third of an inch of rain (about 6 mm), or a drop in the bucket, is the annual rainfall. Drought and El Niño conditions have long been a backdrop to everyday life in this city of nearly 10 million where the Andes meets desert and the land spills into the Pacific Ocean.

More than 1.5 million residents are underserved: They live without running water and with chronic shortages, often waiting for delivery trucks. Villa El Salvador, for example, began as a shantytown on the outskirts of Lima in 1970, and has been growing in colorful tenements up the eroded foothills ever since. But water there is still a luxury.

“Climate change is hitting hard and the future of water for Lima is in doubt,” said Carter Brandon, lead economist with the World Bank. “We don’t actually know what the climate impact is going to be. Or the city’s future growth either.”

Andean topology is so extreme that climate models can’t predict what will happen to rainfall. Lima’s future water security is of great concern to government officials, regulators, the water utility company SEDAPAL, and the people who live and work in this arid port city.

The World Bank has been investigating the need for robust decision making in Lima, and recently completed a comprehensive study of SEDAPAL’s $2.7 billion master plan for water resources to 2040. The Bank draws upon state-of-the art methods for Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMU).

“We have to make decisions even when we don’t know the future,” said Laura Bonzanigo, World Bank economist specializing in DMU. “Through the DMU methodology, we can look at the range of possibilities and come up with minimum requirements to meet every possibility—robust decisions with no regrets.”

In spite of SEDAPAL’s Master Plan, key questions remained. Could the proposed investments ensure reliability in the face of deep uncertainties? Are they all required? What if there are delays? What is the best sequence so that investments ensure both “no regrets” and maximum future adaptability?

The study helped SEDAPAL revise its Master Plan of 14 large-scale investments by identifying projects that it can embark upon now, while preparing future actions adaptively as conditions evolve. When the World Bank team analyzed the 14 projects, they found that investments representing 75 percent of the proposed cost of the Master Plan ($2.0 billion) met water reliability targets just as much as the full $2.7 billion plan. More capital investment did not improve reliability. The study saved the city over $600 million.

Historically, utility companies are used to construction--pumping stations, dams, water treatment plans and tunnels through mountains. “But it turns out some of the most valuable things they can do are ‘soft.’ They can encourage water conservation and recycling. They can make ecological investments in the upper watersheds, working with farmers and ranchers. And they can do better water-quality monitoring with mining companies to protect water quality,” Brandon added.

For the first time, the utility is reaching out to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to protect watersheds and groundwater aquifers. It is also beginning to work with consumers to use less water per household, and exploring with the municipality ways to use recycled water for parks. The analysis has earned the confidence of regulatory and budget agencies. SEDAPAL has also requested further World Bank support, mostly in these areas that supplement more traditional “bricks and mortar” investments.

Engaging Peruvian NGOs is significant because they work closely with communities in upper watershed management (“green” infrastructure) and environmental monitoring. And the universities are important due to SEDAPAL’s interest in training others so the method can be widely applied in other cities under water stress across Peru and other Andean countries.

Decision-Making under Deep Uncertainty is an increasingly important tool for virtually any sector involving long-term planning and investments. Drawing from the Lima study, final workshop participants Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil have already approached the World Bank country offices to request support in the water sector. But other types of investment planning equally suited to this type of analysis are transportation, energy, flood management, and urban development.

A recently published report titled ""Robust Decision-Making in the Water Sector: a Strategy for Implementing Lima’s Long-Term Water Resources Master Plan"" includes more information on the Lima water study. The Bank has also released a new methodological book that helps program managers demonstrate the robustness of their projects, “Confronting Climate Uncertainty in Water Resource Planning and Project Design: The Decision Tree Framework.”",2015-10-05 07:00:00+00:00,"['work', 'water', 'planning', 'address', 'bank', 'world', 'investments', 'uses', 'master', 'thirsty', 'plan', 'study', 'robust', 'lima', 'future', 'needs']",Somalia,news article,English
829,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Horn of Africa Drought Threatens Re-run of Famines Past - Inter Press Service,http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/07/horn-africa-drought-threatens-re-run-famines-past/,"Horn of Africa Drought Threatens Re-run of Famines Past

UNITED NATIONS, Jul 25 2019 (IPS) - Humanitarian groups and the United Nations are warning of another drought in the Horn of Africa, threatening a repeat of the deadly dry spell and famine that claimed lives in Somalia and its neighbours eight years ago.

The British charity Oxfam said Thursday that more than 15 million people across drought-stricken parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia now needed handouts and warned of a hefty death toll unless donors stumped up cash fast. Related IPS Articles Drought, Disease and War Hit Global Agriculture, Says U.N.

Desertification ‘More Dangerous and More Insidious than Wars’

“We cannot wait until images of malnourished people and dead animals fill our television screens. We need to act now to avert disaster,” said Lydia Zigomo, Oxfam’s regional director for the Horn of Africa.

According to an Oxfam report, donors were quick to dig into the pockets for a drought in 2017, helping to stave off a famine that could have been as deadly as the 2011 dry spell that left more than 260,000 dead, and many more hungry and sick.

But while the humanitarian response was well-funded back in 2017, donor governments have not raised enough cash yet this time around, added Zigomo, a human rights lawyer from Zimbabwe.

“We learned from the collective failures of the 2011 famine that we must respond swiftly and decisively to save lives. But the international commitment to ensure that it never happens again is turning to complacency,” said Zigomo.

“Once again, it is the poorest and most vulnerable who are bearing the brunt.”

Halima Adan, Deputy Director of Save Somali Women and Children, said in the Oxfam report that the slowness of the response to the drought “mean[s] women’s burdens and vulnerability are increasing. In often hostile environments, local actors are best placed to reach those most in need, where emphasis must be on reaching women and children”.

The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR has also sounded the alarm. Somalia’s recent April-June and October-December rainy seasons were drier than expected, worsening an arid spell that was already hitting farmers and herders across the turbulent country.

Some 5.4 million Somalis were expected to be facing food shortages by September, and 2.2 million of them would need “immediate emergency assistance” UNHCR spokesperson Babar Baloch warned last month.

Donors had only handed over one fifth of the 711 million dollars that was requested in an appeal in May, added Baloch.

“The latest drought comes just as the country was starting to recover from a drought in 2016 to 2017 that led to the displacement inside Somalia of over a million people,” Baloch told reporters in Geneva.

“Many remain in a protracted state of displacement.”

Last month, the European Union launched a 3.2 million euro scheme to manage water sources and agriculture and lessen the impact of drought, in cooperation with officials in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, and the northern breakaway region of Somaliland.

“Water and land are critical resources for the Somali economy and people’s livelihoods but are also extremely vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change,” said EU diplomat Hjordis D’Agostino Ogendo.

“While access to water needs to increase, needed infrastructures are to be designed and managed in a sustainable way.”

Somalia has seen little but drought, famine and conflict since dictator Siad Barre was toppled in 1991. The country’s weak, U.N.-backed government struggles to assert control over poor, rural areas under the Islamist militant group al Shabaab.

Droughts are getting worse globally, according to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). By 2025, some 1.8 billion people will experience serious water shortages, and two thirds of the world will be “water-stressed”.

Though droughts are complex and develop slowly, they cause more deaths than cyclones, earthquakes and other types of natural disaster, the UNCCD warns. By 2045, droughts will have forced as many as 135 million people from their homes.

“With climate change amplifying the frequency and intensity of sudden disasters … and contributing to more gradual environmental phenomena, such as drought and rising sea levels, it is expected to drive even more displacement in the future,” added Baloch.

But U.N. experts say there is hope. By managing water sources, forests, livestock and farming, soil erosion can be reduced and degraded land can be revived, a process that could also help tackle climate change.",2019-07-25 07:00:00+00:00,"['drought', 'africa', 'million', 'oxfam', 'famines', 'horn', 'water', 'spell', 'need', 'famine', 'past', 'expected', 'threatens', 'somalia', 'rerun']",Ghana,news article,English

The lack of rain, which is also affecting neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, and political instability have tipped Somalia into a food crisis that could persist, even as drought conditions abate.

Image courtesy United Nations A malnourished child waits for emergency medical assistance from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), an active regional peacekeeping mission operated by the African Union with the approval of the United Nations. Somalia is the country worst affected by a severe drought that has ravaged large swaths of the Horn of Africa, leaving an estimated 11 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

Vulnerability to diseases is also of grave concern – according to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR, hundreds of Somali children are dying from a combination of acute malnutrition and measles.

More than half of Somalia’s population is now suffering from lack of food as famine spreads to the Bay region of the country, where food production has fallen 82 percent, according to Voice of America. The famine — officially declared in July — is due in part to a La Niña-induced drought that first hit the Horn of Africa in 2010 and has continued into 2011.

The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon consisting of El Niño and La Niña cycles, and, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), although ENSO is naturally occurring, a warming climate may contribute to an increase in the frequency and intensity of El Niño cycles. This cycle is being classified as a moderate-to-strong La Niña, following 2009’s especially intense El Niño year.

La Niña is characterized by colder-than-normal water surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, causing heavy rains in Australia, Southeast Asia, and South America, while causing drought conditions in eastern Africa.

While drought still prevails in the region, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has reported that there should be near normal rainfall in the Horn of Africa by the end of this year. Though there is still the possibility of another La Niña, it is expected to be weaker than the current cycle. Either way — whether next year there is no La Niña, or just a weakened one — drought conditions will likely ease in the coming months, according to Voice of America.

The weakening of the drought, however, does not necessarily spell the end of the famine.

Food — if it becomes available — is difficult to distribute, and this is the challenge facing aid organizations, which have not lacked supplies as much as the means to get those supplies to people in need. Additionally, Somalia is still in a state of conflict, which will have a great influence on the future of its food supplies. The country’s government, though internationally recognized, is weak and opposed by a number of groups, including the Islamist al-Shabaab, which controls much of the country that has been hit hardest by the famine, the Guardian reported.

The political instability — and resulting inefficiency — also contributed to creating the crisis in the first place, WMO climate expert Rupa Kumar Kolli told Voice of America. Kolli said that meteorologists predicted the drought well in advance and warned policy makers in the affected countries, but they got little response because weather and climate information is often not taken seriously.

“Famines are man-made, whereas droughts are natural parts of the system,” Kolli said.

Government policies encouraging agricultural practices that better utilize water resources will be key to future food security in the Horn of Africa’s arid regions. According to Jeff Hill, director for policy at USAid, this means investing in pastoral livestock farmers, the Guardian reported.

“Livestock provides more food security than growing crops in many arid and semi-arid areas,” Hill said.

Unlike crops, livestock can be moved to water during the dry season’ but, currently, farmers often cannot move their herds freely, sometimes due to cultural and international borders, as was the case earlier this year in a dispute between two ethnic groups on either side of the Ethiopia-Kenya border. If they were allowed to follow the water, rural farmers could become more resistant to drought and famine.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government extended a lockdown by another week Monday after an alarming spike in coronavirus infections continued to surge and started to overwhelm many hospitals in the capital and outlying regions.

President Rodrigo Duterte placed Metropolitan Manila and four outlying provinces, a region of more than 25 million people, back under lockdown last week as daily infections breached the 10,000-mark. Leaders of the dominant Roman Catholic church shifted its Holy Week and Easter events online after all public gatherings, including in places of worship, were temporarily banned.

The government-run Lung Center of the Philippines became the latest hospital in the capital region to announce over the weekend that it can no longer accept walk-in patients after its COVID-19 ward reached full capacity while its emergency room was now handling twice its capacity.

“We are not just full. We are very full. In fact, the hospital has been full for the past two weeks,” Lung Center spokesman Dr. Norberto Francisco said.

Other hospitals said they could take steps to expand bed capacity but there was inadequate number of medical workers partly because many had also been infected.

Duterte’s administration has increasingly faced criticisms of mishandling the pandemic but presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the spread of more infectious coronavirus variants came as a surprise. “No one could have probably foreseen how infectious these new variants are and as a result of which we have these ballooning numbers,” Roque told ABS CBN News, adding officials would inaugurate a 110-bed intensive-care unit in a hospital in the capital region Monday and were planning to launch mobile COVID-19 intensive-care centers.

The Philippines has reported more than 795,000 COVID-19 cases with 13,425 deaths, the highest totals in Southeast Asia after Indonesia.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

BEIJING — COVID-19 cases in the southwestern Chinese city of Ruili bordering on Myanmar have now topped 100.

That comes as authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to vaccinate all 300,000 residents of the city, whose outbreak is something of an anomaly in a country that has all-but eliminated local transmission of the virus.

The National Health Commission reported an additional 20 cases on Monday, five of them in which the persons showed no symptoms.

The cases were detected during city-wide nucleic acid testing, bringing the city’s total to 51 confirmed cases and 56 asymptomatic cases, which China has placed in a separate category.

Confirmed cases are treated in hospital while those who test positive without showing symptoms are isolated and placed under isolation.

Ruili on Friday launched a five-day drive Friday to vaccinate its entire population, with state media showing people lining up to get the jab.

Ad

Some of those infected are Myanmar nationals and authorities have offered free vaccinations to foreigners living and working in the city.

Residents have been order to quarantine at home and non-essential businesses have been closed. Security measures have also been tightened along the porous border to prevent illegal crossings.

China got off to a slow start in vaccinating its population of 1.4 billion people, despite having four vaccines approved for general use, but has now rolled out a nationwide vaccination drive in an effort to build herd immunity.

China has reported 90,305 total cases and 4,636 deaths, with 238 patients being treated in hospitals for COVID-19, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.

ROME — Priests, nuns and other people living in community settings are among the vaccination priority groups permitted under Italy’s revised national rollout. The country’s Piedmont region is going a step further by opening a special vaccine center just for the leaders of religious communities.

Ad

Medical personnel at the Cottolengo hospital complex in Turin are set to administer the vaccine to official representatives of Buddhist, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, as well as Waldensian and other non-Catholic institutions in Piedmont starting Wednesday.

The shots must be given in accordance with the national plan that requires the general population to be vaccinated in descending order of age, beginning with individuals 80 or older or have grave disabilities, then moving down the rollcall to those in their 70s,

Piedmont Gov. Alberto Cirio has called the vaccination initiative an example of inter-faith fraternity and sharing. Italy’s public health service is providing the vaccines.

BETHEL, Alaska — Alaska tribes will receive over $1 billion from the $1.9 trillion federal coronavirus relief bill from March.

KYUK-AM reported Wednesday that the tribes can take as long as three years to spend these funds, unlike a similar bill that was passed in 2020, which had a shorter deadline.

Teresa Jacobsson from the Alaska Tribal Administrators Association says tribes will have more leeway on how to spend the funds compared to previous legislation, but tribes still will be required to document their spending because records will be reviewed by auditors.

They can spend part of the federal funds to get professional help to manage the spending, but Jacobsson said beneficiaries will have to be cognizant of consultants and contractors who have taken advantage of tribes who have received virus relief funds in the past.

LA PAZ, Bolivia — Two nurses in Bolivia are in jail after being accused of stealing 500 COVID-19 vaccines in a small town on the border with Brazil.

Prosecutor Javier Colque requested two months of detention for the women at a hearing Saturday night in the small city of Guayaramerín in the Amazon.

Sealed boxes containing the vaccines were stolen on Thursday from a medical facility in Guayaramerín and were returned the next day by two hooded men who fled, according to authorities. However, Dr. Maicol Borches, coordinator of the city’s health network, said the vaccines won’t be used because they weren’t refrigerated after the theft.

WASHINGTON — Johnson & Johnson is taking over “full responsibility” for a subcontractor’s Baltimore facility that produces the drug substance for its single dose COVID-19 vaccine after an embarrassing mix-up.

The company says it’s adding leaders in operations and quality control to the Emergent BioSolutions plant to supervise the work of its vaccine line.

It comes after enough drug substance for about 15 million doses was contaminated by human error at the plant. The issue was flagged to federal regulators, who have yet to approve any doses from the Baltimore plant, last week.

J&J has delivered about 20 million doses from another plant to the federal government already and says it expects to deliver about 80 million more by the end of May.

DAMASCUS — Scores of Syria’s Christians gathered for prayers in one of Damascus’ largest Churches on Sunday, the second Easter under pandemic restrictions.

Ad

Church-goers eschewed masks but maintained their distance in the Our Lady of Damascus Church, many praying for a way out of the economic and political crises in the war-torn country that have become more dire during the pandemic.

Syria is witnessing a sharp increase in confirmed coronavirus cases. Intensive care units in the capital are full, and hospitals prepared for an influx of COVID-19 patients. The country has not yet started a national vaccination campaign.

So far, the war-ravaged country has reported more than 19,000 confirmed cases, including nearly 1,300 deaths. But the numbers are likely much higher given Syria's battered health care system and sparse testing.

In territories outside of government control, there are about 30,000 infection cases reported in the west and east of the country.

Church celebrations offered a respite from the pandemic, unemployment and inflation.

“We know that outside the country everyone is in a lockdown and closing down. But for us, this celebration is joyous,"" Jimmy Babek, a Christian scout at Our Lady of Damascus, said. “We can’t stop everything. We need to be happy.”

CAIRO -- Authorities say Libya has received its first shipment of coronavirus vaccines.

The Libyan Health Ministry said 101,250 doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine landed in the capital, Tripoli and were taken to the ministry’s storehouses on Sunday.

Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah said in a tweet that other shipments would arrive, although he didn’t set a timeframe.

Libya has seen a swell in confirmed COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.

The county of around 7 million people has reported more than 161,000 confirmed cases and 2,684 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. However, the actual number of cases in Libya, like elsewhere in the world, is thought to be far higher, in part due to limited testing.

The trial events will include soccer’s FA Cup semi-final and final, the World Snooker Championships, and a comedy club show.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details on Monday. He said the trials will play an important role in allowing the “reopening of our country so people can return to the events, travel and other things they love as safely as possible.”

However, dozens of Johnson’s Conservative Party lawmakers have opposed the plans, and Johnson could struggle to get Parliament to approve the trials.

PARIS — Some 9,000 people are getting vaccinated at a huge stadium in Lyon during Easter weekend, and thousands more around France are spending the holiday lining up for injections elsewhere as the government tries to speed up vaccinations amid a new virus surge.

But as France faced its second Easter in a row under the cloud of the pandemic, some cities pushed back against President Emmanuel Macron’s insistence that “there are no weekends or days off during vaccination.”

Ad

Authorities in Strasbourg on the German border shut down their vaccination facilities Friday through Monday, to allow workers “a little rest at last,” according to a city official. To ensure residents still had access to potentially life-saving vaccines, the city expanded vaccination hours during the week and injected all its weekly supply of doses between Monday and Thursday instead.

The city of Sarcelles north of Paris is among those staying open Sunday, amid mushrooming infections and demand. The surrounding Val d’Oise region now has the highest infection rate in France along with some of its poorest neighborhoods, and Sarcelles’ challenges symbolize inequalities worsened by the virus.

The Easter acceleration efforts stand in contrast to the beginning of France’s vaccine rollout in late December, when low staffing for the end-of-year holidays meant a slow start to injections, which initially focused on nursing homes.

France has reported one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, at 96,280 people, and the highest number of virus infections in Europe.

SEOUL, South Korea — A limited number of Christians attended Easter Sunday services in South Korea wearing and adhering to the country's stringent social distancing rules.

Yoido Full Gospel Church, the biggest protestant church in South Korea, allowed only about 2,000 church members to attend its Easter service, or about 17% of its main building's capacity. Masked church members sang hymns, clapped hands and prayed as the service was broadcast online and by Christian TV channels.

Seoul’s Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral, the biggest Catholic church in South Korea, limited Mass attendance to 20% of its capacity and livestreamed the service on YouTube.

Under current physical distancing rules, religious facilities in the greater Seoul area are allowed to have up to 20% of worshippers attend their regular services. Earlier Sunday, South Korea reported 543 new coronavirus cases, taking the country’s total to 105,279 with 1,744 deaths.

LAS VEGAS — Nevada regulators say casinos seeking the state’s OK to raise the current gambling floor occupancy limit above 50% must take steps to encourage their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

The Gaming Control Board and Gaming Commission on Friday issued a memo with guidelines pushing casinos to provide paid time off for employees to be vaccinated, coordinate transportation to vaccine sites and make arrangements with pharmacy companies for vaccine distribution.

The state on March 15 increased maximum gambling floor occupancy to 50% of capacity, up from 25%, and the regulators have been authorized beginning May 1 to approve reopening plans with higher occupancy limits.

The memo said operators’ requests for higher capacity limits “will only be taken in cases where licensees have taken measurable and material steps” to vaccinate their workforce.

The memo said Nevada’s hospitality workforce has a “relatively low degree of vaccination penetration,” though some companies have begun taking steps to encourage employees to be vaccinated.

Effective Monday, Nevada will increase its age-based eligibility for vaccinations to all people age 16 and older.

1401,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Report: Basement flooding is the top climate change cost in Canada - Insurance Business Canada,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/flood/report-basement-flooding-is-the-top-climate-change-cost-in-canada-165200.aspx,"Citing data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the report said that the average cost to repair and remediate a flood basement in 2018 was $43,000 – a figure that could rise even more over time as basement flood incidents across the country continue to rise with the changing weather and climate.

According to the report, the most common factors that increase the risk of flooded basements in homes include ground level windows (82% of homes assessed), downspouts that deposit water less than two metres from the foundation of the structure (78%), basement drains with poor grading that directs water into the foundation (69%), and cracks in basement windows that allow seepage (63%).

The report also found that many Ontario households did not do enough to prevent water damage in their homes. Eighty-five per cent (85%) of Ontario households did not have a backup sump pump or backup power; 71% had furniture or electronics at risk of water damage; 53% had a lack of maintenance of backwater valves; and 40% failed to maintain their sump pumps.

Intact Centre discovered that 60% of participants would take action to reduce flood risk if the actions were simple, cost under $500, and could be completed by a homeowner in less than a day. Acting on that observation, the research centre has suggested 10 actions homeowners can carry out to reduce flood risk – all while costing under $250 (or even nothing at all, in some cases):

Remove debris from nearest storm drain

Correct grading around foundation

Clean eaves and extend downspouts

Install window wells ad covers

Keep floor drains clear

Store valuables in watertight containers

Test sump pump and install backup power

Install and maintain backwater valve

Repair or replace deteriorating pipes and appliances

Install and maintain flood alarms

“For many Canadians, their home is their biggest asset and ultimately their retirement fund,” said Intact Centre head and University of Waterloo professor Blair Feltmate in a statement. “To protect that investment, any homeowner who lives where it rains can easily and cost-effectively deploy simple measures to lower their chances of experiencing basement flooding.”",2019-04-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['change', 'report', 'water', 'centre', 'risk', 'maintain', 'canada', 'homes', 'sump', 'climate', 'cost', 'basement', 'flood', 'flooding', 'backup']",Canada,news article,English

936,DR-2011-000121-CHN,"Police Beat, Tie-Up, and Fire On Citizens Protesting Dying Ramsar Protected Lake in Iran - Green Prophet",https://www.greenprophet.com/2011/08/iran-lake-urmia-protests/,"Police violently repressed activists protesting the nearly irreversible damage done to the Middle East’s largest salt lake over the weekend. This image was taken of a protest earlier this year.

Like a chain of dominos, citizen protests are erupting everywhere: following the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions catalyzed in part by skyrocketing food prices, political protests have swept throughout the Arab world. But it hasn’t stopped there, and not all battles are political.

In Jordan, ordinary people are protesting government plans to include nuclear power in its arsenal of energy sources, while in the United States, Bill McKibben and other well-respected community members, including Jim Hansen from NASA, have been arrested for marching against the Keystone XL Pipeline – a carbon bomb that climatologists say would officially end the battle against climate change (humanity 0 vs. climate change 7 billion). But none of these latter environmental events has garnered such an extreme response as the Lake Orumiyeh protests in Iran, where bloggers report that people are being arrested, beaten, and in some cases tied to trees for protesting the slow death of the world’s second largest salt lake.

Dried up Mecca

In part because of drought and in part because of poorly managed dam construction and irrigation projects, Lake Orumiyeh or Urmia in Northwestern Iran has shrunk to roughly 60% of its original size. Once a mecca for flamingos and other wildlife, the dying lake now more closely resembles a dusty moonscape.

Residents in Azerbaijan that rely on the Ramsar protected site for their sustenance claim that Revolutionary Guards are responsible for shrinking lake levels and the subsequent rise in salinity and decrease in biodiversity. Global Voices claims that if Lake Urmia dries up completely, millions of people will have to settle elsewhere.

Authorities get dirty

Spurred on by these concerns, thousands of protestors spilled into the streets of Tabriz and Urmia last weekend in order to put pressure on the government to step up conservation efforts. But eyewitnesses report that protests quickly took an ominous turn.

According to one blogger, Urmuiscielli, policemen beat and arrested protestors, some of whom were tied to trees.

Although the police crackdown was censored in the mainstream Iranian press, Iran’s Independent Press picked up the story, and the blogosphere was populated by video footage and calls for other citizens to support Azeri activists and re-launch anti-regime demonstrations.

Crimes against humanity

If taken seriously, the increase of environmentally-themed disputes between citizens and their governments, even in the Middle East, could spur a whole new era of accountability measures. Protestors who show little willingness to compromise until real action is taken have the power to disrupt the smooth functioning of society to such an extent that governments (a la Egypt) will have no choice but to instill effect change.

And eventually, when environmental degradation is unequivocally linked to an increase in environmental refugees, green-minded lawmakers such as Polly Higgins, who has been campaigning the United Nations to make Ecocide a crime against humanity, will be better poised for success.

Of course, none of this will happen in Iran anytime soon given that country’s oppressive regime and appalling environmental record, even though these protests show an increasingly emboldened (or desperate?) populace.

885,DR-2011-000121-CHN,Ancient Incan agriculture revived due to climate change - Public Radio International PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-09-09/ancient-incan-agriculture-revived-due-climate-change,"Story from PRI's The World. Listen to audio above for full report.

To get to some of Peru's most remote Andean communities, you head out over pockmarked dirt roads from a small town already 10,000 feet up. Up – up – up — past llamas and alpacas and sheep and cows. The vegetation thins out and the air becomes even thinner. Your lungs clamor for oxygen and you're offered coca leaves to help adjust to the altitude.

And then, after four hypnotic hours, you've arrived – at a patch of sparse farmland near the town of Pomacocha, at 13,000 feet an outpost at pretty much the upper limits of agriculture.

For centuries, Pomacocha's thousand or so residents have grown corn in the fertile valleys below the town and potatoes on slopes that push against the sky above, fed by seasonal rains and glacial streams.

But climate change is hitting the high Andes hard. Temperature and precipitation swings are becoming more extreme, the glaciers are shrinking fast, and a tough place to farm is becoming even tougher.

So to help them deal with an uncertain future, residents are looking back in time—to before the arrival of Europeans.

From a field of brown soil, Pomacocha resident Mariano Ccaccya unearths a small, pink potato—a huaña, one of the first to be grown here in decades. The huaña is the native potato in this part of Peru, but Ccaccya says it had fallen out of favor in recent decades and was about to disappear.

Huaña are bitter, Ccaccya says, and it takes a lot of work to make them palatable. But he says there are good reasons to grow them in times of increasing uncertainty.

Ccaccya, who's the local head of a nonprofit group that's leading an effort to revive ancient Andean crops, says huañas can be stored for two or three years, more than four times as long as most other potatoes. Ccaccya's colleague Adripino Jayo says huañas also resist frost, hail, extreme rain and drought.

""It's very, very strong,"" Jayo says. ""Now that we're in the crisis of climate change, it's worth recovering these potatoes.""

Others think so too. Jayo and Ccaccya's organization, Cusichaca Andina, recently won a grant from the World Bank to further its efforts to promote a variety of resilient ancient Andean crops, including quinoa, amaranth, and different types of potatoes and squashes.

But changing what's grown here is only part of the plan. Cusichaca Andina is also looking to the past to try to change how crops are grown.

On a steep slope in a valley about two hours from the potato fields, Jayo pulls away a stand of brush to reveal an overgrown rock wall. He says the stones are part of a long-abandoned system of agricultural terraces, built into Peru's mountains by the Incas more than 500 years ago.

Terraces like these once blanketed thousands of square miles of the Andes, and were described in the 17th century book The Royal Commentaries of the Incas, by Garcilaso de la Vega.

""They built level terraces on the mountains and hillsides, wherever the soil was good,"" De la Vega wrote. ""And these are to be seen today in Cusco and in the whole of Peru.""

Just a small fraction of the terraces are still used today. After the European conquest, Spanish crops and agricultural systems largely displaced traditional ones.

But here in Pomacocha, old terraces are being restored, and new ones are being built.

Ccaccya says they have a lot of benefits. The terraces help channel water for irrigation while avoiding erosion. They can hold water for months, which is crucial in a place with only intermittent access to water. And plants grown on them are more productive, he says.

Cusichaca Andina is also working on reviving another ancient technology for holding and transporting scarce water—Incan irrigation systems that Garcilaso de la Vega called ""extraordinary.""

""The Cisterns, or Conservatories, were about twelve foot deep, in channels made of hewn stone,"" de la Vega wrote, ""and rammed in with earth so hard, that no water could pass between… But the Spaniards little regarded the convenience of these works, but rather out of a scornful and disdaining humor, have suffered them unto ruin, beyond all recovery.""

Centuries later, the digging and hammering of a handful of men near Pomacocha suggests that the ruin of the Incan irrigation channels was perhaps not quite beyond all recovery. The workers are chiseling and lining up stones along a long-abandoned canal once used to divert water from a nearby spring.

""It's always been here,"" Jayo says, pointing at the stone canal. ""It's probably from pre-Incan times, but it's still useful for irrigation, with a little help.""

Cusichaca Andina and other groups in the Andes have recovered these and other ancient agricultural treasures through a combination of archaeology and exploring local traditions. And they're teaching communities throughout the Peruvian high Andes how to rebuild and use them, along with other ancient agricultural techniques.

It's all part of an effort to increase the resilience and food security.

But the leaders of Cusichaca Andina realize they can only make a small dent in a vast need. Jayo says the Peruvian government has a big role to play as well.

""We see the difficulties in the national context,"" Jayo says. He says the group wants politicians in Lima to apply what it's doing across all of the Andes.

So far national politicians haven't picked up that slack.

But the work here may have relevance to mountainous regions beyond Peru. For instance Cusichaca Andina's founder, British archaeologist Ann Kendall, recently traveled to China. The world's largest country faces huge challenges from climate change and water shortages. And it also happens to have its own system of ancient mountain terraces that Kendall thinks may just be waiting to be revived.

188,Drought Sri Lanka,"Madagascar drought: 330,000 people 'one step from famine', UN warns - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/25/madagascar-drought-330000-one-step-from-famine-un-food-and-agriculture-organisation,"The severe drought afflicting southern Madagascar has left 330,000 people on the brink of famine, a senior UN official has warned.



Three successive years of failed rains have left the island nation wrestling with crop failure and a chronic lack of food and clean drinking water, with agencies warning last month that nearly 850,000 people are experiencing “alarming” hunger levels.

“Three hundred and thirty thousand are on the verge of a food security catastrophe, next step being famine,” said Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies and rehabilitation at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

“People go from one lean season to the next, resorting to negative coping strategies. People are eating anything to fill their stomachs, selling most of their belongings, cattle and land. It shows the severity of the situation and the need for us to act.”

Farmers talk of the earth changing; of failed rains and crops, and barren land. Meanwhile, agencies are fighting a desperate rearguard action. Unicef, the UN children’s agency, reports growing demand for the high-calorie, peanut-based paste used to combat severe acute malnutrition.

“People are living under extreme conditions. We are dealing with a development crisis that has lasted for decades now, worsened by El Niño. For many, it is day-to-day survival,” said Elke Wisch, country representative for Unicef Madagascar.

Wisch emphasised the need to build resilience in the disaster-prone country, where food production has all but ground to a halt as the El Niño weather phenomenon exacerbates the effects of the drought. “We know that natural disasters will occur,” she said. “The important thing is how the local population can respond to these shocks.”

Yet mounting any kind of response is complicated by huge funding shortfalls. The World Food Programme’s (WFP) operations across seven countries in southern Africa are only 50% funded between now and April, with the total deficit at roughly $300m. The organisation’s $82m drought relief operation in Madagascar, which runs until March 2017, faces a $50m shortfall.

The FAO is also struggling, with a $17.5m shortfall limiting the distribution of emergency packages to 75,000 of the the 175,000 farming households in need.

Appealing for further donations, both organisations have stressed the importance of the forthcoming planting season. “If we miss planting season, the need for food assistance could go into March 2018,” warned Burgeon.

Either way, the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. Poor infrastructure makes it difficult to get assistance to remote areas of the south, with journeys of more than 200km likely to take days by road.

Moreover, nutritional challenges are endemic, with more than 50% of children suffering from stunted growth, a condition caused by malnutrition over the first 1,000 days of life. The issue costs the world’s sixth poorest country an estimated $740m a year, roughly 7% of its GDP.

We're starting to see people eating seeds instead of planting them. That is a desperate situation Elle Wisch, country representative, Unicef Madagascar

“We have not even reached the peak yet, we are four to five months away from the next harvest,” said David Orr, the WFP’s regional spokesperson.



Madagascar’s president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, will be anxious to ensure that infrastructure issues in Antananarivo, the country’s gridlocked capital, do not impinge on the hosting of a summit for French language states this weekend. With hotel swimming pools being used for drying sheets and laundry, and the city’s river running lower than normal due to its use for bathing, washing and stone production, Antananarivo has not been untouched by the effects of the drought.

After the summit, Rajaonarimampianina will travel to the Paris headquarters of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation for a donor conference.

In the absence of more immediate support, however, farmers in the region reliant on rain-fed agriculture face a precarious existence. “Worst case is another crop failure,” said Wisch. “Then you are looking at – and we’re starting to see this now – people eating seeds instead of planting them. That is a desperate situation.”",2016-11-25 08:00:00+00:00,"['need', 'warns', 'situation', 'madagascar', 'drought', 'food', 'planting', 'country', 'famine', 'wisch', 'unicef', 'season', '330000', 'southern', 'step']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
469,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"Amid chronic violence, millions of Afghans face risks of drought-related displacement - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/amid-chronic-violence-millions-afghans-face-risks-drought-related-displacement,"By Enayatullah Azad, Media, Information & Advocacy Coordinator, Norwegian Refugee Council

OSLO, Aug 30 2018 (IPS) - Amid a precarious security situation in Afghanistan, the worst drought in recent history that hit two out of three provinces in Afghanistan in July has destabilised the lives of tens of thousands of civilians, some of whom have already been displaced.

The United Nations has predicted that over two million people are expected to become severely food insecure in the coming period.

The West Region of conflict-stricken Afghanistan has been hardest hit by the drought, and over 60,000 people have been displaced to Herat and Badghis provinces, as a result.

Families that fled to Herat are living in dire conditions in makeshift shelters, where they are exposed to the scorching sun and summer temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius. Many families are subsisting on a single meal a day. Many get by on just bread and water.

Herat has become the closest refuge for about 60,000 people, who have been displaced from their homes due to the drought. Conflict has also prompted many to flee their homes to the relative safety of province.

Over 1700 civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the first half of 2018, according to UNAMA. It is the highest recorded number, compared to the same periods for the past decade. The combination of drought and conflict has made tens of thousands of families destitute. They live with few long term prospects or means of regaining stability.

Among the most vulnerable are women and children. Many of the children show visible signs of malnutrition and illness, including skin diseases and eye infections due to dust and the hot weather.

Ayesha Halima is one of thousands of such children, who fled her home for Herat. Leaning against the wall of a distribution center, she patiently awaits her next meal, as her mother moves through the growing crowd to get their rationed supplies.

The lack of sufficient nutrition is visible in the pallid faces of children like Soraya Hawa Gul and FatimaPari Gul, who have become neighbors in Herat. They bake bread together in a clay oven in the open air. The mothers make about ten loaves of bread a day, which they wash down with boiled water or tea.

“We cook together because we share a bag of flour,” said Hawa Gul. “Neither of us could afford a bag of flour alone. We have spent all the money we had and have taken many loans from relatives.”

Given such meagre resources, the unconditional cash grants from ECHO and NRC have become life-lines for tens of thousands of the impoverished households. Despite the rapidly deployed assistance, drinking water, food and medical supplies are falling short.

The blazing temperatures are testing the endurance of those who are in the IDP settlements. Many people are suffering from dehydration, with children and older IDPs particularly susceptible. With few water resources around, drinking water is a prized commodity in the settlements.

“We can’t get enough water to drink or to clean ourselves and our clothes,” displaced Afghans in Herat told staff of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “There hasn’t been any change to our life situation. We fled our homes because there was no water and it is the same here. At least we a had shelter back home in Badghis.”

With illnesses such as diarrhea, skin diseases and eye infections on the rise, many children are in need of comprehensive medical care. One-year-old Ahmad Mohammed has diarrhea, and a skin and eye infection. He lives in a makeshift shelter with his family after they were forced to leave their home in Badghis city/region/province. “It’s been 70 nights since we arrived. My children and my wife are all sick, and I don’t have the money to buy them enough food or medicine,” Mohammed’s father Ziauddin told NRC.

Shelter is another pressing issue, with families residing in makeshift shelters for the time being. While protection from the scorching sun and the high summer temperatures are the present concern, staying warm and winterisation of homes will become a need, if they remain displaced into the winter months.

But, despite the challenges, women like 57 year old Khanim Gul, who have been displaced several times, show remarkable resilience. Gul was forced to leave her family behind in Badghis. “This isn’t the first year we are suffering from drought. Last year we had almost nothing on the table. This is the fifth tent that I am setting up – the heavy wind keeps tearing it apart,” she said.

Amid the struggles of daily survival, protection has been scant, with women and girls facing heightened risks of harassment and gender-based violence. In the absence of regular schooling and safe spaces where they can grow, learn and play, children are more prone to child labour and child marriage.

Amid scarce resources and lack of livelihood opportunities, including daily labour, many of the displaced men in Herat try to travel to Iran in search of work.

With regular wages a far-fetched notion for most of the displaced populations, Karim is counting his blessings these days. With loans from family members, he has set up a vegetable stall and sells onions and potatoes to the rest of the displaced community near his tent in Herat.

For thousands of families displaced from Herat the few items they carried on their backs are the only remnants of their homes. For many, this is not the first instance of leaving their homes and belongings because of drought.

While news of peace talks and bombings in Afghanistan make the headlines, the IDP communities suffering chronic, long term displacement feel “forgotten” by their government and the international community. They are in desperate need of long term assistance.",2018-08-30 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'gul', 'afghanistan', 'afghans', 'drought', 'families', 'droughtrelated', 'homes', 'children', 'chronic', 'displaced', 'millions', 'amid', 'risks', 'violence', 'face', 'displacement', 'thousands', 'herat']",Afghanistan,news article,English

RIYADH - Australia overcame heat and jetlag to ease past Saudi Arabia 3-1 while Japan looked jaded during a 1-1 draw with Uzbekistan in the third round of Asian qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup on Tuesday.

Australia's patchy 2-1 victory over Thailand last week was unconvincing but at Dammam two goals by Josh Kennedy and a penalty from Luke Wilkshire lifted the Socceroos to the top of Group D.

Kennedy opened his account against the Thais and on Tuesday he was at it again, heading a Wilkshire cross into the net just before halftime.

The Japan-based striker added a second goal on 56 minutes after cashing in on Brett Holman's defence-splitting pass.

The hosts pulled a goal back through Nassir Al Shamrani but Kennedy was then fouled in the box and Wilkshire converted his penalty in the 77th minute.

By contrast, Japan's away-match experience was all about toiling for a draw.

Uzbekistan wasted a string of chances against a weary-looking Japan side yet to taste defeat in 13 games since Italian Alberto Zaccheroni took charge in October.

Captain Server Djeparov volleyed Uzbekistan into the lead after eight minutes, celebrating with a triple back flip as the home fans lit flares and roared with delight.

Shinji Okazaki's diving header gave Japan a barely-deserved equaliser in the 65th minute, triggering something of a shootout as both teams suddenly threw caution to the wind.

""Uzbekistan pushed us around a bit,"" Zaccheroni told reporters. ""Give them credit, they are a very good side. We were better in the second half but we must play better than that.""

Japan still top Group C on four points, ahead of Uzbekistan on goal difference.

DOLLOW, Somalia, August 30 (UNHCR) - UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres visited Somalia on Tuesday and called for greater efforts to provide life-saving aid to tens of thousands of displaced Somalis inside their country.

Noting that UNHCR is assisting around 850,000 Somali refugees in neighbouring countries, with at least 1,500 still fleeing Somalia every day, Guterres, who heads UNHCR, said: ""We should not aim at emptying Somalia, but rather at making every effort to provide aid inside [the country].""

The High Commissioner made his call while visiting Dollow, a dusty town on southern Somalia's border with Ethiopia. Thousands of people fleeing drought, famine and violence in other parts of Somalia have flocked here, with many crossing into Ethiopia.

Guterres, accompanied by Sweden's Minister for International Development and Cooperation Gunilla Carlsson, came to Dollow to show solidarity with the displaced population at a time of extreme suffering and to mark the Eid al Fitr holiday, which marks the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.

The visit represented the start of a major new effort by UNHCR and its partners to step up humanitarian aid inside Somalia, where huge numbers of people are in need of urgent assistance. UNHCR has had only intermittent access to many areas due to extreme insecurity.

Many of the displaced Somalis who talked to Guterres in Dollow had harrowing tales of loss and starvation during their flight across harsh desert terrain. He said it would be better if the international community could bring the aid to them, rather than have vast numbers of people risking their lives in search of food, water, shelter and other vital assistance.

""I am always fighting to make sure Somalis have the right to seek asylum,"" Guterres said before adding: ""Somalis should have the right to choose to stay in their own country."" He called on all parties to cease violence, respect humanitarian law and to allow unfettered access to all people in need.

Carlsson added that it was critical for the international community to ""not only help in an emergency, but to address the root causes.""

The displaced in Dollow are camped in makeshift shelters of sticks and tattered cloth. Many say they will remain there until the rains come and the fighting between government troops and the Al Shabaab militia eases.

One woman, Hado Sugow, told the delegation she lost four of her children to starvation and thirst during the 15-day trek from her home to Dollow. ""I will go back when there is rain,"" she insisted. Somalia has been suffering its worst drought in more than half-a-century.

Dollow also serves as a major transit point for Somalis headed for the four UNHCR-run refugee camps in Ethiopia's Dollo Ado district, which is a two-hour walk across the border. But increasing numbers, particularly farmers, are reluctant to leave Somalia, waiting instead to return to their land if the rains return as predicted in October.

The UN refugee agency continues to have indirect access to populations in Al Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia through its NGO partners, who employ hundreds of Somali staff to distribute international aid.

UNHCR is significantly scaling up its distribution of emergency assistance packages in a bid to reach at least 400,000 people by mid-September. UNHCR is also enhancing its staff presence in Dollow and Dobley, also near the border, as well as in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.

""This famine should be a turning point and we are determined to make a real difference to Somalis where they are, so that they don't feel compelled to move to another country,"" said Bruno Geddo, UNHCR's representative to Somalia. ""Humanitarian access in Somalia is gradually opening up and we are moving in to help step-by-step.""

57,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Warming threatens to cut crop yields | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/warming-threatens-cut-crop-yields/,"Projecting the impact of climate change on global food production is no easy task. A warming climate might result in better crop yields in one region, but cause drought and crop failure in another.

A new US study, published in the journal Environmental Letters, assesses the odds of a major slowdown in global food production over the next 20 years.

Overall, the study’s authors say, the likelihood of a sharp drop in yields of crops vital to food supply, such as wheat and maize, is “not very high” − but global warming does markedly increase the chance of such events happening. The risk to global food supplies is about 20 times greater when man-made climate change is taken into account.

“Climate change has substantially increased the prospect that crop production will fail to keep up with rising demand in the next 20 years,” says Claudia Tebaldi, a research scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a co-author of the study.

“ The truth is that, over a period of 10 or 20 years, it depends largely on how fast the Earth warms, and we can’t predict the pace of warming very precisely. So the best we can do is try to determine the odds David Lobell, associate director of the Center on Food Security and the Environmentat California’s Stanford University

Climate trends

Tebaldi, together with David Lobell, an associate director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment at California’s Stanford University, used computer models of global climate trends, together with data on weather patterns and crops, to calculate the odds of a major downturn in food supplies.

“I’m often asked whether climate change will threaten food supply, as if it’s a simple yes or no answer,” Lobell says.

“The truth is that, over a period of 10 or 20 years, it depends largely on how fast the Earth warms, and we can’t predict the pace of warming very precisely. So the best we can do is try to determine the odds.”

Yields of crops such as maize and wheat have typically increased by between one and two per cent a year over recent decades. This trend, says the study, needs to be maintained to cope with population growth, greater per capita food consumption, and the increased use of crops for biofuels.

The authors of the study – which was funded by the US government’s National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy − found that under what they term natural climate shifts, the odds on that trend slowing up to 2030 were only 1 in 200.

Global food supplies

However, when human-induced global warming is taken into account, the odds shorten to one in 10 for a slowing in yields of maize and one in 20 for wheat production. Such cutbacks, says the study, would have a major impact on global food supplies at a time when demand is growing sharply.

Tebaldi and Lobell say an increase of 1˚C in temperature is capable of slowing maize yields by 7% and wheat yields by 6 per cent, although there are regional variations to these figures.

The study says a slowdown in yields of maize and wheat could, in theory, be offset by shifting planting to cooler regions, but there is little sign that such shifts are happening – at least not quickly enough to take account of warmer temperatures.

“We can’t predict whether a major slowdown in crop growth will actually happen, and the odds are still fairly low,” says Tebaldi.

“But climate change has increased the odds to the point that organisations concerned with food security or global stability need to be aware of this risk.”",2014-08-04 07:00:00+00:00,"['threatens', 'climate', 'cut', 'study', 'warming', 'yields', 'odds', 'global', '20', 'maize', 'crop', 'wheat', 'food']",China,news article,English

762,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Arsenal's young players: From Pepe & Tierney to Nelson - Inside the Gunners' creation of a youth army - Goal,https://www.goal.com/en/news/from-pepe-tierney-to-nelson-willock-inside-arsenals-creation/1oc8eo9h2c1gr12frhjq1yscqk,"From Pepe & Tierney to Nelson & Willock - Inside Arsenal's creation of a youth army

The Gunners are putting their faith in young players as they look to return to the summit of English football under Unai Emery

""Identifying, recruiting and developing young players is a key part of our strategy.”

Those are the words of Raul Sanllehi, Arsenal’s head of football and the man leading an overhaul at the Emirates aimed at not just restoring the Gunners to the summit of English football, but also putting them back among Europe's elite.

Arsenal are a club known for giving youth a chance. George Graham two’s title-winning teams were built around players who had progressed through the under-age ranks.

The likes of Tony Adams, David Rocastle, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson helped end an 18-year wait for a league championship, in 1989, and then, two seasons later, they were joined by the likes of David Hillier and Kevin Campbell as the Gunners again finished top of the old First Division.

However, during Arsene Wenger's 21-year tenure, Arsenal didn't just rely on local talent. Teenagers were brought in from across the globe and given a platform to turn themselves into world stars.

Nicolas Anelka was the first in a succession of success stories, including Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Wojciech Szczesny.

Those players, along with a British contingent featuring Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott, were the bedrock of Arsenal's famous 'project youth', the period which followed the move from Highbury to the Emirates, which left Arsenal financially hamstrung by construction costs.

It was a period that promised plenty but ultimately failed to deliver any silverware. They went close more than once, but that only strengthened the belief among many critics that Arsenal were hindered by a lack of experience.

Between 2005 and 2014, Arsenal failed to win a trophy – a drought that came to an end in the first season after the purse strings were loosened, resulting in the arrival of Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid for £42.5 million ($51.7m).

Arsenal have won the FA Cup three times in the last six years, but now they want more. The Gunners have found themselves outside of the top four in the Premier League for each of the past three seasons – which is considered unacceptable by those now running the club.

Sanllehi, a man who is used to winning following his time with Barcelona, is determined to bring the good times back to Arsenal – and he feels young players will help do just that.

Whenever you speak with the Spaniard, it’s never too long before the conversation turns to Barca and the sustained success enjoyed by the Catalans over the past two decades.

Sanllehi believes the bedrock of that success was the club’s famous La Masia academy, which produced a plethora of players with ‘Barcelona DNA'.

Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Carles Puyol and Pedro all knew exactly what it meant to play for the Blaugrana, according to Sanllehi, and, consequently, would go that extra yard when needed because of their deep-rooted love for the club.

And that is precisely what he wants to replicate at Arsenal. Sanllehi makes no secret of the fact that he believes that a successful academy will be key if the Gunners are to get back on their perch at the top of the English game.

“We have some great talent coming through our younger age groups and, like all top clubs, the challenge is to help them make the most of their abilities,” he said.

""We need to make sure the academy pathway continues to drive great talent into the first team.”

Right now, the standard of players being produced is as high as it has been for years. Arsenal have pumped money into their academy, spending £40m ($48m) on improving facilities at Hale End and London Colney.

The redevelopment project lasted for nearly two years and Hale End is now unrecognisable, a sporting complex up there with the best on offer anywhere in England.

This project pre-dated Sanllehi’s arrival, with former chief executive Ivan Gazidis driving the plan forward before the new Hale End was completed in 2017.

“We wanted to take the level of the facility to something that was world class and world leading,” Gazidis said. “It’s something that will stand the club in good stead as we look forward.

“We’ve got an ambitious goal. To get to one young player joining our first-team every two years.

“Youth has always been one of the bedrocks of this club and with this investment we’re future proofed for at least the next 10 years.”

This summer, Arsenal promoted four players from the youth team to the senior set-up: Emile Smith Rowe, Joe Willock, Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson.

What's more, both Nelson and Willock started on Sunday, when Arsenal kicked off their new Premier League campaign with a 1-0 win at Newcastle.

With Ainsley Maitland-Niles also in the side, that meant that three of the starting XI at St James’ Park were academy graduates. Two of them, Nelson and Willock, were teenagers and you'd have to go back 21 years to find the last time two English teenagers started a league game for the Gunners.

That’s a hugely encouraging sign and it must be noted that Nketiah would have probably been involved too had Arsenal decided not to send their impressive young forward out on loan to Leeds United on deadline day.

Nketiah, who took just 43 minutes to score on his Leeds debut, will be back next summer. This isn’t a loan with a view to a potential sale.

Indeed, Arsenal are adamant that he will return and join Nelson, Willock and Maitland-Niles in the first-team; that’s why they were so thorough when it came to choosing a destination for Nketiah.

The north London giants have been hurt in the past by sending players out on loan to the wrong club. Serge Gnabry’s ill-fated move to West Brom is still viewed by senior figures at the Emirates as the reason they lost the German star.

Gnabry made just three appearances while at the Hawthorns during the 2015-16 season before returning to north London, with Pulis stating the teenager – who is now starring in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich – was not at the required level to play.

A disillusioned Gnabry then turned down a new contract at Arsenal in favour of a return to Germany and in the space of just three years has transformed into one of the brightest young stars in the game.

Arsenal are determined to prevent similar situation happening in the future and the way Nketiah’s exit was handled shows how much attention to detail now goes into deciding where their best young players will be sent.

Close to 20 clubs had shown an interest in loaning the striker and those were whittled down to just three: Leeds, Bristol City and Fortuna Dusseldorf.

Representatives of those three clubs were then invited down to London Colney and - as first revealed by the Athletic - asked to produce a presentation detailing exactly why Nketiah should join them and how they planned to use the forward.

Loan manager Ben Knapper, contract negotiator Huss Fahmy and Nketiah himself listened to the presentations and, ultimately, it was decided that a move to Elland Road would be best for the 19-year-old.

It was the first time that Arsenal used this process to select a club for a young player and is another sign of the importance the Gunners now place on the loan market in terms of developing talent.

But it’s not just academy players that are the heart of the work being done in a bid to bring the good times back to London’s most decorated club.

A look at the recruitment that has taken place since the end of the 2017-18 season shows that youth is now viewed as the way forward.

In the summer of 2018, Matteo Guendouzi arrived as a teenager from France and 22-year-old Lucas Torreira was signed from Sampdoria.

This year, Nicolas Pepe, 24, was signed for a club-record £72m ($87.5m) fee, while 22-year-old left-back Kieran Tierney was bought from Celtic and 18-year-old forward Gabriel Martinelli arrived from Brazil.

William Saliba, aged just 18, also joined from Saint Etienne for £27m ($32.8m), but he will spend this season back on loan with the Ligue 1 outfit before linking up with Unai Emery’s squad on a permanent basis next summer.

With Tierney, Saliba, Rob Holding and Hector Bellerin, Arsenal have a potential back four that could remain in place for years.

However, Arsenal are aware that youngsters need to time to settle, which is why the likes of David Luiz and Sokratis – both now in their 30s – have also been brought in to share the workload and provide much needed experience, both on the pitch and in the changing room.

The clever recruitment in recent seasons, combined with the investment in the academy, has seen Arsenal amass an army of hugely talented young players that is generating plenty of excitement behind the scenes at the Emirates.

Nelson, Willock, Guendouzi and Maitland-Niles are leading the way, but scratch beneath the surface a little and you have teenagers such as Bukayo Saka, Tyreece John-Jules and Folarin Balogun, who are all expected to become first-team players in the coming years.

Of course, while the conveyor belt of talent at Hale End is producing some of the best youngsters in England, the challenge now is ensuring they all get the opportunity to fulfil their potential at Arsenal.

With that in mind a ‘transition team’ was set-up in the summer, which saw Freddie Ljungberg – last season’s Under-23s boss – promoted to the senior coaching set-up.

“The transition from Under-23 to first team is massive,” said Sanllehi. “It’s a specifically English issue as we don’t have B teams playing at a high level, which our European competitors have.

“So, we need to make careful choices around who stays with the Under-23s, who trains with the first team and who goes on loan.

“The transition team will be responsible for managing development plans for each and every player to best optimise their potential.”

Ljungberg’s arrival has already seen the likes of Robbie Burton given a chance during the summer, with the 19-year-old midfielder making a big impression during the tour to the United States.

“Freddie is helping us with the young players because he knows better than us every young player,” admitted Emery.

“For example, I didn’t know Robbie. Freddie said to me he’s a good player with the capacity to play as a six or an eight. Really, he helped us like we needed.”

Whether Burton goes on to make his mark with the first-team remains to be seen, but his performances in the States were another sign that the work being done to get the best out of Arsenal’s young talent is already bearing fruit.

The original ‘project youth’ may have ultimately flattered to deceive in north London, but there are signs that the updated version could go on to bring success that Sanllehi, Emery and the fanbase crave.",2019-08-16 07:00:00+00:00,"['pepe', 'tierney', 'nelson', 'arsenal', 'inside', 'arsenals', 'academy', 'creation', 'willock', 'team', 'gunners', 'young', 'best', 'end', 'players', 'youth']",Ghana,news article,English
1027,Drought Sri Lanka,"David Miliband, Former UK Foreign Secretary, Appointed President of International Rescue Committee - PR Newswire",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/david-miliband-former-uk-foreign-secretary-appointed-president-of-international-rescue-committee-200175931.html,"NEW YORK, March 27, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The International Rescue Committee (IRC) today announced the appointment of David Miliband, 47, former Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, as its president and CEO, effective September this year. He will succeed George Rupp, who has led the global humanitarian relief and development organization since stepping down as president of Columbia University in 2002.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130327/DC83911LOGO)

Over the last 15 years, Miliband has had a distinguished political career in the United Kingdom. From 2007 to 2010, he served as the youngest U.K. Foreign Secretary in three decades, driving advancements in human rights and representing the United Kingdom throughout the world. In 2006, as U.K. Secretary of State for the Environment, he spearheaded the groundbreaking Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill, establishing the world's first legally binding framework for reducing carbon emissions.

""I am deeply honored to have been appointed president of the IRC,"" Miliband said. ""Thanks to the leadership of George Rupp, the dedication of its staff and the confidence of its donors, the IRC today is strong, effective and widely respected, and I am committed to helping the IRC team build on their great work. The IRC's mission is personal for me because my own parents were refugees who arrived in Britain in the 1940s. I look forward to honoring the memory of those who helped my parents by leading the IRC as it continues to offer help today to uprooted people around the world. I will bring to the IRC a passionate commitment to social justice and international cooperation. I am eager to listen to the stories of its diverse staff, beneficiaries, partners and funders, and adding ideas of my own, as we chart a confident future for an organization that has an inspirational past.""

""David is an experienced world leader and a man of both action and character,"" Rupp said, ""as his record as Foreign Secretary—including his work for conflict resolution in the former Yugoslavia, his leadership in calling for a political settlement in Afghanistan, and his drive for education reform in Pakistan and human rights in Sri Lanka—attests. His insights, ability and commitment will be tremendous assets. I look forward to witnessing this next exciting chapter of the IRC's incredible journey of helping the most desperate people move from harm to home.""

""The IRC was looking for a proven leader with the ability to project our message, deepen our partnerships and build on our record of innovation on behalf of displaced people around the world,"" said Sarah O'Hagan and Thomas Schick, co-chairs of the IRC's Board of Directors. ""In David Miliband we have found such a leader.""

During the last decade, the IRC has responded to a wide range of humanitarian crises, including those associated with the civil war in Syria, the war in Iraq, the conflict in Darfur, the drought and famine in the Horn and East Africa and more recently the Sahel, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2008 cyclone in Myanmar and earthquakes in Pakistan, Haiti and Japan. The IRC has also carried out major development and assistance programs in Afghanistan, Congo, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere. In addition, the agency has helped more than 75,000 refugees begin new lives in the United States over the last decade. Founded in 1933 at the suggestion of Albert Einstein to help victims of the Nazis, the IRC today has operations in more than 40 countries. Its staff includes more than 12,000 men and women around the world, and nearly 1,300 volunteers in its 22 U.S. refugee resettlement offices. The IRC's budget is expected to exceed $440 million during the current fiscal year.

David Miliband is currently Member of Parliament representing South Shields. He is Co-Chair of the Global Ocean Commission. Before serving as Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for the Environment, he was Minister for Communities and Local Government (2005–2006); Minister for Schools (2002–2004); and Head of Downing Street's Number 10 Policy Unit (1997–2001).

Miliband graduated from Oxford University in 1987 with a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics, and received his master's degree in political science in 1989 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he attended as a Kennedy Scholar. He is married to the violinist Louise Shackelton and they have two sons. His office will be located at the IRC's global headquarters in New York.

Poor rainfall, harsh winter, ceaseless conflict, long-term displacement.

Any one of these hardships would be too much to bear, but as drought and conflict drive widespread humanitarian need throughout Afghanistan, many families are facing them all.

This year, Afghanistan is in the midst of the most severe drought since 2011, increasing the humanitarian needs of households struggling to cope with multiple shocks. Households who depend on farming and herding for their income and food have seen their livelihoods decimated by poor rainfall and high temperatures.

Many herders have had to sell their livestock because their grazing land is damaged, particularly in north and west Afghanistan. As of mid-2018, at least 3.5 million Afghans across 20 provinces are acutely food insecure as a result of the drought, according to the UN. In addition, the number of people displaced by drought in 2018 — more than 249,000 people — has almost surpassed the number of people displaced by conflict.

The looming Afghan winter is unforgiving. To help communities in need, USAID’s Office of Food for Peace is providing emergency food and nutrition assistance, including critical support for drought and winter response activities, to help vulnerable families meet their critical food needs through the frigid winter months amidst drought.

USAID partner the UN World Food Program (WFP) has supported the most at-risk people since the first signs of drought. WFP already reached more than 1 million people across 15 provinces with emergency food assistance — including split peas, salt, and vegetable oil — and supported access to food in local markets between July and October, and it plans to reach up to 2.5 million people with life-saving food by the end of 2018.

To meet this goal before the worst of winter makes roads to remote, drought-affected areas impassable, WFP is pre-positioning urgently needed assistance in advance. For example, WFP transports supplies across the Amu Darya River from neighboring Tajikistan to reach Afghanistan’s northern provinces, depositing the food and specialized nutrition products in warehouses, stores, and health centers as close as possible to the people who need it.",2018-12-19 08:00:00+00:00,"['food', 'snow', 'wfp', 'drought', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'conflict', 'provinces', 'responds', 'families', 'nutrition', 'need', 'usaid', 'assistance', 'winter']",Afghanistan,news article,English

SUMMARY OF THE CRISIS & RESPONSE

On 25 April, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in northern Mozambique, bringing a path of destruction and damage to the Cabo Delgado and Nampula districts. Tropical Cyclone Kenneth was the second cyclone to hit Mozambique in a span of just six weeks and the first to make landfall this far north in the country. Entire villages were flattened and thousands of people were displaced, in a country already dealing with the consequences of drought and Cyclone Idai.

More than 55,400 hectares of crops have been either partially or completely destroyed, and many fishing villages lost their boats and equipment during the storm. A cholera outbreak has been declared, with cases reported in Pemba, Metuge and Mecúfi.

To support the Government-led response to Cyclone Kenneth, humanitarian organizations are appealing for US$103.7 million to assist more than 373,800 people in need. UN agencies and partners are currently operating with depleted stocks and a seriously stretched to respond to both Cyclone Kenneth and Cyclone Idai, where urgent needs remain.

Additional funding is urgently required to enable the delivery of immediate life-saving assistance to people in desperate need.

606,Drought Sri Lanka,Repayment and Relief: Addressing microfinance debt in Sri Lanka - Groundviews,https://groundviews.org/2019/04/10/repayment-and-relief-addressing-microfinance-debt-in-sri-lanka/,"Nadaraja Devakrishnan stumbled on the gravity of the microfinance debt issue purely by chance. He was attempting to begin community gardening in a small village, to respond to rising cases of CKDu in the district. On returning to check the progress of cultivation, he found none, as all the people had been physically and monetarily drained trying to pay back their microfinance loans. Through the People’s Movement for Community Awareness, he has been grappling with the predatory practices of microfinance companies on villagers in Vavuniya for the last few years.

“The way the microfinance companies are treating people is as much a violation of human rights as enforced disappearances, or things done to people under the Prevention of Terrorism Act” he says to a group of women who have come together to share their struggles, and to think of ways to respond to agents of these companies, who harass them for repayment.

“In the immediate aftermath of the war, there were about 3 or 4 microfinance companies working in the North, but after the government changed in 2015, there are about 34 operating now, including companies run by prominent politicians.”

Cascading loans and predatory repayment tactics

As of March 28 2019, around 170 people are reported to have taken their own lives after being unable to meet debt repayments. In 2018 alone, 15 people in Vavuniya and 55 people around the Province have taken their own lives as a direct result of this crippling debt, says Devakrishnan. He works with several women whose lives have been altered by these companies, and details the immense pressure placed on them for repayment. “They come and harass the women in the house, ask them to sleep with them, take away possessions from the home, and refuse to leave unless they are given the money.”

*Meenakumari and her husband wanted to build a grinding mill, much like the one he had worked in as a child, to operate as a source of income. After a few years of seeking support from microfinance companies to support this dream, she now has ten loans to her name.

“Berendina, Ceylinco Leasing Company, Vision Fund Lanka, LOLC, Commercial Leasing, Kanrich, MBSL, Nation Lanka and HNB Grameen”, she counts off on her fingers.

Her first loan, for Rs. 50,000, was from Berendina, and she paid a monthly instalment of Rs. 4,800 for one year. In order to complete the next phase of their building, they took a loan of Rs. 100,000, paying Rs. 4,600 weekly. Their current loan, from HNB Grameen, is for Rs. 200,000, with a weekly payment of Rs. 3,900 due. It is this loan that has sent Meenakumari and her husband spiralling into debt.

The grinding mill brings in only a limited income of around Rs. 5,000 a month. The price of goods produced at home is higher than those of mass-produced spices and flour that people can buy at a store. For this reason, they are forced to price their goods lower, and this severely impacts their ability to repay their loans.

They took two more loans to settle the borrowing of Rs. 200,000. However they find the largest chunk of their money goes towards settling what are called ‘metre loans’. These are informal agreements with the credit agent,that requires a daily interest payment. Meenakumari has a total of 7 metre loans that she is now paying off.

*Madhavi is the mother of two young girls. One day, her neighbour left their house to hide, fearing a credit agent who was due to collect a payment. The agent refused to believe Madhavi’s explanation that the person was in hospital, and loitered around the house. Madhavi was then forced to ask some money from the nearby shop and pay the agent on behalf of her neighbour.

Her house now functions as a loan centre for Vision Fund Lanka, set up by the company to operate locally within small villages. From here, they give out and accept applications, take payments and supply information. There is no written acknowledgement however that Madhavi’s house is being used for this purpose. She acts as the loan centre leader, again a role that has no written confirmation. When asked what happens if people borrowing through her centre are unable to repay, she says “the leader has to find the money and pay the agent, somehow”.

Sajee, who acts a centre leader in her village, says that the agents do supply a lot of information to borrowers. They explain forms, interest and repayment to the villagers clearly. While there is a policy that loans need to be income-generating, the agent never checks on this, to account for the strain on the borrower if this is not so.

She lists the documents necessary to obtain a loan. Copies of one’s NIC and for women, a copy of one’s husband’s NIC, a family card, issued by the local grama sevaka, and a note of income and expense. There are some issues with these documents. Family cards are not regularly updated, and might not account for any children born since the time of issuance. Since the income is a self-declaration, and requires no certification, people often increase the value to better their chances of getting a loan, but also distorting the agent’s perception of their ability to repay the loan.

They are required to send all this in an envelope with a Rs. 50 stamp. Also required is a signed copy of a slip, provided by the agent that can be produced in court if they cannot repay the loan. The information is filled in by the agent should the need arise. Alarmingly, the women note that they sign on a blank document when submitting it.

*Shanthini, who has taken loans through the centre Sajee leads, says that the agent does not keep track of individual loans, and the strain placed on them by multiple companies. “Unless we’ve taken loans from a particular agent before, the rest of our loans don’t register on any of the records. Many people do not disclose this to lenders as they apply for new loans either.”

She explains the schemes for loans from Vision Fund Lanka, a subsidiary of World Vision. An education loan of Rs. 15,000 can be paid in December, to prepare for the child’s new year in school. Rs. 150,000, with a monthly interest payment of Rs. 54,000, is the value of a housing loan. Finally, their ‘Saviya’ loans give Rs. 100,000 to individuals wanting to start small businesses in their homes. Monthly payments for each of these loans are Rs. 15,000, Rs. 8,600 and Rs. 7350 respectively.

If an agents thinks that a particular borrower is able to make regular repayments of their loan, they extend their housing loan to as high as Rs. 500,000. However, if a borrower signs on to this extension, they allow the agent to take the deed or permit of their house as collateral for non-repayment.

LOLC has a similar policy, where personal loans of Rs. 500,000 must carry signatures of two guarantors who are government servants, and require house documents as collateral. Lawyer Lakmali Hemachandra, who is working on relief for these women, notes that this is possibly just a tactic of intimidation. “Given that a lot of the land in the North, after release, is state land, residents would only have a permit. Permits cannot be transferred between individuals, so it is unsure what they plan to do when the deed is surrendered, or if they can do anything with the land. It’s probably just to make people more fearful and dependent on their support.”

The women say there are people who have left the country to escape being choked by these loans. Due to the harassment and threats meted out by agents, it falls on others to pay what is left. The prevailing drought has compounded the uncertainty and strain on these individuals and their families – it impacts the gains that could be made from agriculture. Existing employment options are limited, and loans do little to alleviate the burden.

Community and legal relief

Community organisations are doing their best to provide some relief for the people. This begins with debt mediation boards, where a compromise is reached to reduce the loan amount. Prashan, leader of a Rural Development Society, says that he refused loan agents entry into the village one day, so they would not harass people who could not pay that month. In some villages, men have even physically chased away agents, running after them as they attempt to approach the houses of those struggling with repayment.

Attorney-at-Law Radika Gunaratne is representing several women across the North-Central province in courts, as they file cases against predatory microfinance companies. ‘’Cases should ideally be dealt with at the district courts, but police intervene before legal action is even taken, threatening people to pay. They know where to visit them at home because the companies openly share their details with the police’’. Gunaratne says the cost of such a case, if it is eventually taken to court, once again only serves to trap the person with more expenditure on legal fees.

“The people need a two year grace period” Devakrishnan says “no loans taken, no repayments made, just time to revive the economy and make some money.”

Debt relief programmes and their effectiveness

In July 2018, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera presented a paper in Cabinet that proposed to write off loans less than Rs. 100,000 for communities in the North. In addition, the Central Bank proposed to set a cap of 35% on interest rates on these loans. While hailed for their attempts in addressing a crippling issue, there is some hesitation as to the full impact of these measures.

Ministry of Finance officials noted to Groundviews that the 35% cap is only applicable to those firms in the formal economy, and it is those in the informal economy who are inflating borrowing costs with high interest rates. They claim that a rate cap of below 35% is likely to push the formal players out of the industry, creating more space for the informal sector that charges high interest rates from borrowers.

“In my opinion, the debt relief and regulatory measures are not enough to address the debt problem the women are facing”; economist Niyanthini Kadirgamar has a range of reasons to claim so. This begins with the fact that the interest rate cap comes into effect only if companies sign a voluntary Memorandum Of Understanding. Even if they were to comply with the standards therein, then the 35% interest rate cap is still too high. The companies are raking in profits while these women and their families face hardships. “These loans are obtained by very poor women for small self-employment efforts; there is no way they can earn enough incomes to pay off such high interest rates” Kadirgamar says.

Currently, the Government’s debt relief program targets only those who have defaulted payments for three months. Kadirgamar says that this doesn’t take into account the fact that many women somehow try to pay off the loan, often resorting to extreme measures to do so, such as skipping meals for children, selling their land, or taking another loan. The women pay their monthly dues due to pressure and aggressive collection practices adopted by the companies. “I know of women who have gone into hiding to escape the debt collectors”, Kadirgamar says, stressing that the reality is very different from what these companies tend to advertise about microfinance – ‘poverty alleviation’ and ‘women’s empowerment’ are words that have no depth in the way microfinance is affecting families across the Northern province.

She suggests that an effective strategy would be a complete write-off of all the predatory loans. Poor women should not be made to pay unfair interest on their small loans. The UN expert on foreign debt also highlighted that human rights standards must be upheld with micro-credit lending. A moratorium of at least two years would also be helpful for drought-affected areas, until they are able to revive their livelihoods.

The officials claim that debt write-off is not a sustainable policy, and that these debt relief operations were targeted for women especially vulnerable due to the ongoing drought. Comprehensive legislation that will protect consumers, and regulate the steps that microfinance institutions can take to collect repayments, is necessary, and is presently being drafted.

Provisions for relief in the 2019 Budget

The 2019 Budget proposed the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme as an avenue to relieving these individuals from the debt trap. These concessionary loans are primarily for those engaged in the agricultural sector, with no collateral needed to be eligible for it. While the Ministry states the rates are much less than those offered by a microfinance institution, it is nevertheless offering more loans as a remedy for issues that loans have caused.

The Ministry believes that since these loans are given to invest in revenue generating activities, chances are that in the medium- to long-term, households would be able to create sustainable avenues of income that can be used to pay-off previous debt. However, this assumption must be considered alongside the fact that the North, Eastern and North-Central provinces have accounted for the lowest GDP by province in the years 2016 and 2017. In addition, the agricultural sector accounts for the lowest percentage of economic activity in these three provinces. As discussed above, individuals might take loans for cottage industries or agricultural work that does not always generate a high income, and could once again serve to affect repayment. Whether this strategy as it stands will actually translate into sustainable income for the individuals, given the structures and opportunities currently in place in these regions, will only play out in the years ahead.

The Ministry notes that financial literacy is being accelerated by the Central Bank, to educate possible borrowers on the risks of taking loans from the informal sector. However, there is a long road ahead in ensuring that microfinance becomes a sustainable tool to improve lives of the individuals who take these loans, many of whom constitute the most vulnerable segments of the population. Framed as legislation for consumer protection, the new act could result in more responsible lending practices and also lay out consequences for companies or agents who do not adhere to these. If new loans do not act as a solution to the individuals who have suffered deeply as a result of old ones, then it is necessary for moving toward alternative models – such as cooperative credit schemes, as Kadirgamar suggests – that are developed based on what is most beneficial for the community and individuals who need it most.
