201,Drought Sri Lanka,Rising Temperatures to Blame for Water Loss in Colorado River - EcoWatch,https://www.ecowatch.com/colorado-river-drought-2288623714.html,"By Tim Radford

The Colorado River is dwindling, and climate change is officially to blame. In the first 14 years of this century, the flow declined to only four-fifths of the 20th century average, according to new research. The water lost would have been enough to supply two million people for a whole year.

Altogether, the river supplies water to seven U.S. states and two in Mexico, and 40 million people rely on it for their water. But the entire Colorado River basin has been experiencing sustained drought since 2000. And somewhere between one sixth and one half of this liquid loss can be put down to global warming, scientists said.

They publish their findings in the journal Water Resources Research. ""This paper is the first to show the large role that warming temperatures are playing in reducing the flows of the Colorado River,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences and of hydrology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona.

""We're the first to make the case that warming alone could cause Colorado River flow declines of 30 percent by mid-century and over 50 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated.""

His co-author Bradley Udall, a climate scientist at Colorado State University, said, ""The future of the Colorado River is far less rosy than other recent assessments have portrayed. A clear message to water managers is that they need to plan for significantly lower river flows.""

The two scientists began by looking at the drought years of 2000-2014. The river starts with precipitation in the upper regions of its drainage basin, in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico.

They found that in the first decade and a half of this century, average temperatures in the region were 0.9°C higher than the average for the past 105 years. This is, very roughly, the temperature by which the globe has warmed on average over the last century, under a global warming regime driven by greenhouse gases emitted from fossil fuel combustion.

But there is another factor to consider. The U.S. Southwest has a climate history characterized by intermittent megadroughts—periods of much lower rainfall over spans of 20 to 60 years.

Researchers have proposed that the risk of megadroughts is likely to increase in any climate change scenario. What actually will happen is uncertain, but the scientists are betting that as greenhouse gas emissions rise, so will the difficulties of water supply.

""Even if the precipitation does increase, our work indicates that there are likely to be drought periods as long as several decades when precipitation will still fall below normal,"" said Overpeck.

According to Udall, ""Current planning understates the challenge that climate change poses to the water supplies in the American Southwest. My goal is to help water managers incorporate this information into their long-term planning efforts.""

977,Drought Sri Lanka,Feature: Climate Change Report Warns of Dramatically Warmer World This Century - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/11/18/Climate-change-report-warns-dramatically-warmer-world-this-century,"The report, reviewed by some of the world’s top scientists, is being released ahead of the next comprehensive studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013/14, and follows the Bank’s own Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change in 2008 (Check out: Development and Climate Change - A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group for FY09-11) and the World Development Report on climate change in 2010. ""Turn Down the Heat"" combines a synthesis of recent scientific literature with new analysis of likely impacts and risks, focusing on developing countries. It chronicles already observed climate change and impacts, such as heat waves and other extreme events, and offers projections for the 21st century for droughts, heat waves, sea level rise, food, water, ecosystems and human health.

The report says today’s climate could warm from the current global mean temperature of 0.8°C above pre-industrial levels, to as high as 4°C by 2100, even if countries fulfill current emissions-reduction pledges.

""This report reinforces the reality that today’s climate volatility affects everything we do,"" said Rachel Kyte, the Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development. ""We will redouble our efforts to build adaptive capacity and resilience, as well as find solutions to the climate challenge.""

The World Bank doubled lending for climate change adaptation last year and plans to step up efforts to support countries’ initiatives to mitigate carbon emissions and promote inclusive green growth and climate-smart development. Among other measures, the Bank administers the $7.2 billion Climate Investment Funds now operating in 48 countries and leveraging an additional $43 billion in clean investment and climate resilience.

Rising Sea Levels

The report says sea levels have been rising faster in the last two decades than previously, and this rise is being seen in many tropical regions of the world. This phenomenon is partly due to melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; the rapid growth in melt area observed since the 1970s in Greenland’s ice sheet is a clear illustration of its increasing vulnerability. Arctic sea ice also reached a record minimum in September 2012. ""There are indications that the greatest melt extent in the past 225 years has occurred in the last decade,"" says the report.

""It’s early yet but clearly some of the small island states and coastal communities are beginning to take a hard look at their options,"" said Erick Fernandes, co-lead of the Bank’s Global Expert Team on Climate Change Adaptation. ""The need to adapt to climate change will increase as global population reaches 9 billion in 2050,"" he added.

Ocean Acidification

Coral reefs are acutely sensitive to changes in water temperature and acidity levels. The report warns that by the time the warming levels reach 1.4° C in 2030s, coral reefs may stop growing. This would be a result of oceans becoming more acidic as a result of higher CO2 concentrations. And with 2.4° C, coral reefs in several areas may actually start to dissolve. This is likely to have profound consequences for people who depend on them for food, income, tourism and shoreline protection.

Heat Extremes

A 4°C warmer world would also suffer more extreme heat waves, and these events will not be evenly distributed across the world, according to the report.

Sub-tropical Mediterranean, northern Africa, the Middle East, and the contiguous United States are likely to see monthly summer temperatures rise by more than 6°C. Temperatures of the warmest July between 2080-2100 in the Mediterranean are expected to approach 35°C – about 9°C warmer than the warmest July estimated for the present day. The warmest July month in the Sahara and the Middle East will see temperatures as high as 45°C, or 6-7°C above the warmest July simulated for the present day.

Lower agricultural yields

Hotter weather could in turn lower crop yields in a 4°C world—raising concerns about future food security. Field experiments have shown that crops are highly sensitive to temperatures above certain thresholds. One study cited in the report found that each “growing degree day” spent at a temperature of 30 degrees decreases yields by 1% under drought-free rain-fed conditions.

The report also says drought-affected areas would increase from 15.4% of global cropland today, to around 44% by 2100. The most severely affected regions in the next 30 to 90 years will likely be in southern Africa, the United States, southern Europe and Southeast Asia, says the report. In Africa, the report predicts 35% of cropland will become unsuitable for cultivation in a 5°C world.

Risks to Human Support Systems

The report identifies severe risks related to adverse impacts on water availability, particularly in northern and eastern Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. River basins like the Ganges and the Nile are particularly vulnerable. In Amazonia, forest fires could as much double by 2050. The world could lose several habitats and species with a 4°C warming.

Non-linear impacts

As global warming approaches and exceeds 2°C, there is a risk of triggering nonlinear tipping elements. Examples include the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet leading to more rapid sea-level rise, or large-scale Amazon dieback drastically affecting ecosystems, rivers, agriculture, energy production, and livelihoods. This would further add to 21st-century global warming and impact entire continents.

The projected 4°C warming simply must not be allowed to occur—the heat must be turned down. Only early, cooperative, international actions can make that happen.",2012-11-18 08:00:00+00:00,"['4c', 'world', 'warns', 'report', 'heat', 'century', 'change', 'climate', 'dramatically', 'global', 'warming', 'warmest', 'warmer', 'development']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

Between 31 July and 3 August 2018, the first phase of the Drought Impact and Needs Assessment (DINA) surveyed 350 households, held 10 Key Informant interviews and conducted 5 Focus Group Discussions with drought-induced internally displaced people in Hirat city, Hirat (around 12,000 families), Qala-e-Naw city, Badghis (around 1,000 families) and Chaghcharan, Ghor (around 600 families). Most respondents had arrived from Badghis (73 per cent), specifically from Balamurghab and Muqur districts, while 14 per cent had arrived from Ghor and 8 per cent from Faryab.

Drivers of displacement

Assessment results reveal the impact of the drought on agriculture-related livelihoods as a key driver of displacement. Over 70 per cent of respondents’ livelihoods depended on agriculture at home. Of those respondents who owned land, 84 per cent said that production last winter season was only half, or less than half, than in a normal year. Those who had owned livestock reported having lost almost all their poultry and camels/horses, as well as 93 per cent of large ruminants and 90 per cent of small ruminants.

The lack of water is a key concern. 78 per cent of respondents reported severe shortages of water for agriculture. Over half reported that, when they left home, availability of water for domestic use was very low (47 per cent) or that water was not available at all (7 per cent). 60 per cent reported major shortages of water, and 47 per cent reported a significantly lower quality of water as compared to previous years prior to displacement.

The drivers of displacement are multi-faceted. Only 10 per cent of respondents were planning to return to their areas of origin for a number of reasons: 71 per cent mentioned insecurity; many also referred to the lack of basic services (39 per cent), water (47 per cent) and livelihood opportunities (40 per cent).",2019-02-24 08:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'afghanistan', 'hirat', 'owned', 'cent', '47', 'drought', 'internally', 'families', 'needs', 'shortages', 'respondents', 'displaced', 'provinces', 'impact', 'ghor', 'key', 'badghis', 'reported', 'half']",Afghanistan,news article,English
2042,FL-2017-000017-PAK,WHY KARACHI FLOODS - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1578061,"In order to address the reasons for Karachi's flooding, its complexities must first be understood.

The record-breaking rains of August 27 resulted in a near-collapse of the citys infrastructure and exposed the lack of foresight, planning and governance that the metropolis has long suffered. But in order to address the issues, their complexities must first be understood





This monsoon season, Karachi flooded as never before. Streets were turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, landslides occurred in a number of places damaging vehicles and property, and over a hundred persons drowned or were electrocuted. The people of Karachi understand well that the causes of the problems of the city that they love so much are political and institutional and so are their solutions. However, the province and Islamabad, the antagonists in the Karachi situation, have yet to accept and express this.

It is generally believed that the reason for the flooding is encroachments by the residents of katchi abadis on the natural drainage system of the city and that the solution lies in removing these encroachments and the solid waste that has accumulated in the nullahs. However, the situation is far more complex than that, and has aggravated over a long period of time. This article tries to explain this complexity and the steps that have been taken in the past to address it and what, in technical terms, needs to be done now in a very changed situation.





A HISTORY OF DRAINAGE

As most Karachiites know, Karachis stormwater drains into two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other with a distance of between 14-20 kms in between. Forty-three stormwater drains (or nullahs), according to the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) documentation, and 64 according to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), carry the water of their huge catchment areas to them and over 600 smaller drains feed into these 64 nullahs. In addition, real estate has been built over thousands of even smaller nullahs.

Before independence, Karachis population was only 450,000. The city had a sewage system consisting mostly of underground earthenware pipes and it was treated through biological treatment at Gutter Baghicha located in the trans-Lyari area of the city between the Haroonabad drain and the Orangi nullah. The treated Effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. Gutter Baghicha, which covered an area of just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares), has been reduced to 480 acres (according to the NGO Shehri) due to illegal yet officially sanctioned settlements.

With partition and the arrival of about 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand and both formal and informal sector developments took place far away from Gutter Baghicha. The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns, Landhi-Korangi and New Karachi, at a distance of about 20 kilometres each from the then city. Sewage treatment plants were planned for these settlements and treated sewage was to be disposed; in the case of Landhi-Korangi, to the Korangi Creek and in the case of North Karachi, to Khawaja Ajmer Nagri nullah. However, these plants were never constructed and so untreated sewage is still disposed at these locations.

Because of an absence of a sustainable social housing policy, informal settlements developed along the nullahs, and these discharge their sewage into them as well. After the mid-60s formal sector developments, in the absence of an alternative, also used the nullahs for disposal. So one can safely say that, post the mid-60s Karachis sewage system has been officially planned to dispose into the nullahs and, as a result, sludge from sewage began to clog the nullahs and their tributaries.

Map1

In 1978-79, there were very heavy rains in Karachi and much of the housing along the nullahs was washed away. After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities to compact it along the nullah edges to secure them from erosion and flooding and to acquire land to extend their homes into the nullahs. It would not be out of place here to mention that the stormwater drains developed by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) also carry sewage to the Clifton beach and, in the process, pollute the sea. With the passage of time, solid waste generated by the city increased from 6,500 tons to 14,000-15,000 tons between 2001 and 2020 and, in the absence of proper management and control, became increasingly difficult to manage. This had severe repercussions for the overall drainage system in Karachi.





THE SOLID WASTE ISSUE

Although Karachi is spatially a large city of 3,780 sq kms (with a built up area of approximately 500 sq kms), it has only two landfill sites, both next to each other and in District West. Consequently, solid waste has to be carried for over 40 kms from the eastern edge of the city so as to reach the landfill sites. Because of this distance, and the time and costs entailed, solid waste from most of Karachi does not reach the landfill sites, and is dumped at numerous informal dumping sites along the Korangi Creek and various other open areas and nullahs that join it. Proposals for additional landfill sites have been made since 1975 and, in a 2001 report, one landfill site for each district was suggested, but never implemented.

Meanwhile, a solid waste recycling industry, mostly in the informal sector, developed in Karachi over the years. This recycling industry, which is growing rapidly, acquires recyclable material from two streams. One is known as the clean stream, whereby housewives and markets sell bottles, newspapers, metal objects and cans to kabaarris, who then sell them to the recyclers. The other stream is known as the dirty stream, wherein young boys, mainly of Afghan origin, are organised by contractors to pick all recyclable material from kachra kundis or neighbourhood dumps. They carry it on bicycles to abandoned parks, empty plots or spaces under bridges, where it is sorted out into different categories and sold to the recyclers by weight.

Bones are crushed into powder and mixed with chicken feed; rags are turned into fluff by rag-pulling machines and used for upholstery; small pieces of paper are recycled into board; and plastic items are granulated and the granules are sent to the Punjab for being turned into utensils and toys. The contractors organising this activity pay the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff to not pick up the garbage so that the picking can be made easier. The organic waste that is left behind has, over the years, been dumped in the nullahs or has been burned. Burning has been reduced considerably due to public protests.

The homes along the nullahs also throw their waste into them. It is estimated by various reports that no more than 30 to 40 percent of waste reaches the landfill sites. By the mid-90s, most of the nullahs of the city were full of compacted solid waste, and today children play cricket and football on them. A 2001 study by the Karachi Urban Resource Center estimated that, directly or indirectly, the recycling industry employed over 40,000 families. The number today is nearer 100,000 families.





ENCROACHMENTS AND LAND RECLAMATION

In the absence of the implementation of Karachis development plans and the pressure for space for commercial activity, the local government constructed many bazaars over the nullahs such as the Urdu Bazaar and the Tyre Market. Meanwhile, the Government of Sindh, for its own use, has constructed car parking facilities, offices and a MPA hostel on the nullahs, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan is constructed on a nullah, and so is part of the womens college on Burnes Road and a bank building.

Meanwhile, in the posh areas, the VIPs had extended their homes on to the natural drainage systems and some of these were removed in 2004 by orders of the then Mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal.

Pressure for homes due to an absence of affordable housing for the poor has constantly increased in Karachi, especially in the 90s and 2000s. As a result, solid waste has been used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite residential purposes. Such reclamation is, strictly speaking, illegal in both cases. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire KMC tractors to spread and compact it. This land is sold while the reclamation is taking place and even before it is physically visible.

It is estimated that, for parts of Macchar Colony, Sultanabad, Shireen Jinnah Colony and Keamari alone, 17 sq km of land has been reclaimed from the sea, and over 1,000 households live on it. A major part of Phase 8 of Karachis most elite settlement, DHA, has been reclaimed from the sea through the use of municipal solid waste.

Another major problem facing the drainage issue is that the outlets to the sea have been blocked or considerably reduced, as a result of which stormwater disposal is hindered. The Mehmoodabad nullah disposes into the Gizri Creek estuary, where DHA has developed plots for its Phase 7 scheme. A 60 ft nullah, constructed by DHA, now carries sewage and rainwater to the creek. Since this outlet is insufficient, it slows down the disposal to an extent that, at high tide during rainfall, there is a backwash into the nullah. As a result, large tracks of Mehmoodabad, Chanesar Goth and PECHS Block 6 extension are inundated, and remain as such for long periods of time.

Similarly, the Mai Kolachi Bypass and the Karachi Port Trust Officers Housing Society also block the exit of Pitcher nullah into the China Creek backwaters, because of which large areas of Saddar get flooded. A similar situation exists at the point where the Kalri nullah enters the China Creek backwaters.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.

But there are a number of other obstacles too to the journey of stormwater from the north to the sea. A major obstacle is encountered at the Northern Bypass where, because of its height above the Lyari floodplains and the absence of sufficient culverts, water accumulates, flooding large low-lying areas on both sides of the bypass. In addition, road construction in most of the low-income settlements is 3-4 ft above the level of the settlements, and there is no system of draining these settlements in case of heavy rains. As a result, they become islands of stagnant water till it is pumped out or absorbed by the land.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.





GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES

Government agencies have undertaken the rehabilitation and/or the building of a large number of roads. The tender documents require the construction of drains along the sides of the roads. These are invariably built and are usually of an excellent standard. However, more often than not, they do not have a disposal and usually end where the road construction or rehabilitation ends, leaving the stormwater to find its own destination.

Meanwhile, in the last decade and a half, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels, hillocks and water collection depressions. As a result, when it rains, areas immediately south of this region (such as Saadi Town) are completely submerged by floodwaters from the hills.

Areas which have not been levelled out and are next to the ones that have been levelled, collapse in the rains and, if there is housing on them, there is major loss of life and property. With more developments taking place in the Kirthar foothills, the likelihood of flooding and landslides will also increase.





THE KARACHI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

Photo by Tahir Imran

To overcome some of these problems, the Government of Sindh (KWSB and the local government) in the late 80s launched the Karachi Urban Development Programme. The programme consisted of rehabilitating the old sewage treatment plant and the construction of new ones, along with the building of trunk sewers along the main roads so as to take the sewage to the treatment plants. A large Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan was taken for this purpose.

The Orangi Pilot Project-Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) was consulted regarding the implementation of the Orangi Town part of the project. It noticed that the trunks did not pick up the existing sewage system in which local government and the people of Orangi had invested billions of rupees. To connect the existing system, which flowed into the nullahs, would require digging up hundreds of kilometres of existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure to connect to the ADB trunks. Apart from being a waste of government and peoples investment, the communities would never agree to put up with this inconvenience and the psychological impact, of seeing their work and investment destroyed, would have been devastating.

When OPP saw the entire plan for the city, it observed that what was proposed for Orangi was proposed for the entire city. Connecting the existing sewage system to the trunks would require many more ADB loans, increasing Pakistans foreign debt.

The capacity of Karachis sewage treatment plants is 151 million gallons per day. However, since the sewage does not reach the plants, no more than 25 million gallons-a-day can be treated and, since the plants are so grossly under-utilised, severe maintenance problems surface. Meanwhile, sewage continues to flow happily into the drainage system.

These problems were recognised by the OPP-PTI as early as 1988. The OPP-PTI proposed that the reality of sewage flowing into the natural drainage system be accepted, and that trunk sewers be laid in the bed of the nullahs or on either side of them. However, we did not have enough knowledge then regarding the number of nullahs, the relationship of the existing sewage systems to them and the terrain through which different nullahs flowed and, as such, this concept could not be properly framed.

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding.

The knowledge regarding these issues was developed by the seminal work done by architect Perveen Rehman, then director OPP-RTI. She identified and documented 43 nullahs and, on the basis of this knowledge, OPP worked out the details of a sewage system consisting of trunks on either of side of the nullahs and being connected near the disposal points with each other, and pumped from there to the treatment plants (See map below for OPP-RTI proposal).

This proposal was accepted and, with modifications, it formed the basis for the Greater Karachi Sewage Plan (also known as S-3)  part of which is now under construction. At a meeting where this decision was taken, the ADB consultant for the design of the ODA UK-financed trunks expressed grave concern and pointed out that Her Majestys government had invested 1 million pounds in the preparation of the designs.

This ignoring of ground realities and existing infrastructure has been a characteristic of foreign-funded infrastructure projects in Karachi, resulting in excessive costs, as in the case of the ADB-funded Korangi Waste Water Management Project. This was a 100 million US dollar project, of which 80 million US dollars was a loan. After OPP redesigned the project to integrate the existing system and reworked the rates, the cost of the project was reduced to 26 million US dollars, which led the then Governor of Sindh, Moinuddin Haider, to cancel the loan (for existing infrastructure at Korangi Project see map above).

In addition, all foreign-funded projects have a fairly high percentage of costs allocated for capacity building. Yet, over the last 40 years, no capacity to deal with the evolving situation has developed. This is because capacity building is done through foreign trips to look at good practices and through workshops and seminars. No permanent institution for research, monitoring and training has been established  a basic requirement for any capacity building and the establishment of a continuous culture of learning.

During the mapping of the stormwater drains, OPP-RTI had constant interaction with the local communities living along the nullahs. It was only them who knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of the various smaller drains that have disappeared. So far, how they can be made part of the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

OPP also studied how the Japanese, after the devastation of the Second World War, had dealt with a similar situation. They had secured the edges of the nullahs to prevent erosion. In appropriate places, they had covered the nullahs and used their roofs as public space and created sports grounds, childrens play areas and community spaces for older people. Unfortunately, OPP could not carry out these proposals.





QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESIGN STANDARDS

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding. If the latter, then engineers will have to work to establish appropriate standards. In the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020, it was also proposed that dams be constructed in the foothills of the Kirthar range, to store large quantums of water. However, only one dam, the Thaddo Dam, has been constructed. Will the construction of additional dams reduce the pressure of water entering Karachi? This too needs to be ascertained.

Politicians, bureaucrats, developers and even a number of engineers have stressed that the removal of encroachments from, and the cleaning of, the nullahs is the first step towards easing the situation in Karachi. However, from what has been discussed above, the most important step that needs to be taken is to remove the encroachments at the outfalls, so that water can enter the sea. Also, it has to be understood that, if the housing along the nullahs is removed, the water will erode the edges of the nullah and cause a major disaster by flooding out the housing at the edge, as it did in 1978 and 1979, and we will be left with a huge housing and relocation problem.

It is essential that, even before attempting such an exercise, a proper documentation of the potential affectees is drawn up, with Nadras assistance, and encroachment removal is across the board, with the source criteria being applied for both rich and poor, unlike in the past. It is also relevant to note here that there is sufficient federal and provincial government land within the city to easily house over 80,000 families at almost no cost to the state. Proposals for this have also been floated off and on in the press.





THE NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNANCE

Many of the problems that have been identified above cannot be dealt with together. A criteria for prioritising them will have to be developed. All of them are really a part of a larger planning process for Karachi. Such a planning process requires research, on the basis of which politicians can take informed decisions; the development of plans (with the participation of communities) by an empowered and well-staffed planning institution, and their implementation in a transparent and accountable manner. And finally, there will have to be a monitoring, operation and maintenance process, especially at the neighbourhood level.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place.

Much of this work will be have to done at the grassroots level and will entail the empowering of the Union Councils and the involvement of citizens in the formulation of the Union Councils annual development programme. Karachi packages, as developed in the past, and projects unrelated to a larger plan, will not help in the creation of an appropriate planning process, nor will time- and cash-bound projects funded by international financial institutions such as ADB and the World Bank. History taught us these lessons long ago, but we have failed to learn from them.

What is being suggested above cannot be carried out by provincial bureaucrats or by short-term sophisticated consultants and the companies to whom contracts for delivering services have been handed out to by the Government of Sindh. Nor can a national disaster management authority develop long-term plans for disaster prevention without an implementation arrangement with the line departments and local governments. To deal with the Karachi situation, an effective local government organisation is required, which ends the fragmentation of Karachi into different planning jurisdictions, with all its departments under central control. So far, the Sindh government has been averse to this, because it wishes to control the city through a highly centralised form of governance, because it does not gain the required number of seats to promote decentralisation.

However, the prime minister has proposed autonomous city governments for the major cities of Pakistan. For this, a political consensus among the different parties would be required and, given the sentiments and the enormous resources that Karachi possesses, this would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place. A very important ingredient for what has been suggested are human resources. For that it is necessary that a research and training institute be established, whose training would be for politicians at all levels and for staff involved in project preparation, implementation and monitoring.

An association with community leaders and activists would have to be an important part of the training. Can this be made possible over a period of time? If yes, there is hope for a better Karachi. If not, we will simply continue to muddle through.

713,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"New Walmart stores, new hotels among investments planned in Oaxaca - Mexico News Daily",https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/new-walmart-stores-new-hotels-in-oaxaca/,"Just 10 months ago the Oaxaca economy was said to be collapsing and Walmart México was considering an exit from a state where roadblocks by protesting teachers and their allies had cost an estimated 1 billion pesos.

Yesterday, Governor Alejandro Murat Hinojosa offered a rosier outlook: far from leaving, Walmart is going to open at least three new stores and Mexican hotel owner Grupo Posadas will build a new 200-room hotel in Oaxaca city.

The governor said during a meeting yesterday with members of the Mexican Association of Real Estate Professionals, or AMPI, that the conditions are in place to guarantee investment in the state, reactivate the economy and create jobs.

In addition to a third project — a 200-million-peso boutique hotel at the Yagul archaeological site, about 36 kilometers from Oaxaca city — the governor revealed he had met recently with Mexican and foreign investors who are considering projects worth US $2 billion.

In order to make things smoother, he said, the state will create a new agency to reduce bureaucratic procedures for those who wish to invest.

Although the sites of the new Walmart stores were not revealed, Grupo Posadas’ new Gran Fiesta Americana hotel will be located near the Parque El Llano in Oaxaca city’s historic center. The 500-million-peso property (US $27 million) will be self-sustaining, said company official Mariano Rosales, employing energy-saving lighting and systems to recycle and save water.

He said construction is almost set to begin and completion of the project will take about 18 months. The hotel will employ 250 people.

Meanwhile, the Oaxaca local of the CNTE teachers’ union, Section 22, is planning to mobilize in May, as it has done for years, and reorganize in order to “resist the assault by the state.”

815,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Fabian Delph: Winning a trophy for Everton is my No 1 aim after Manchester City exit - Sky Sports,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11768963/fabian-delph-winning-a-trophy-for-everton-is-my-no-1-aim-after-manchester-city-exit,"New Everton signing Fabian Delph says ending the club's 24-year trophy drought is his main aim, and insists he can bring the experience necessary.

The 29-year-old joined the Toffees on a three-year deal from Manchester City, where he won the Premier League title twice under Pep Guardiola.

But Everton are without a piece of silverware since the 1995 FA Cup, a drought their fans are acutely aware of, and Delph says correcting that is top of his list of priorities.

""I've been fortunate enough to be in a squad full of winning mentality,"" Delph said in his first press conference since joining. ""I'm not going to change coming here. The main goal is to be successful and win something.

""I'm aware the club hasn't won something in a long time. That's top of my list to hopefully try and push the lads and them to push me and win something.

Image: Delph hadn't started for City since he was sent off at Leicester in December

""[The winning mentality] probably comes easier to me because I'm one of the older players. You don't have to be the best player in the team to influence people, to drive and to set standards high with good habits.

""The winning mentality is massive. Everyone needs to be on it and have that mentality in training. There's no egos here. A great work ethic and the staff are fantastic.""

Despite being a big part of Guardiola's successful City side throughout 2017 and 2018, Delph has not started in the Premier League since he was sent off in a defeat at Leicester last December.

City went on to win the title, and though Delph admits his last six months with the club were frustrating, he insists he stayed professional throughout.

""Really frustrating, from a very young age all you want to do is play. I had a great spell the season before, where I was playing pretty much every game. Obviously I got sent off and didn't feature. It's been frustrating.

""But I'm very professional, I got my distances up and did everything I could to get back in the team. I made myself available, and the team were in a very good place, but unfortunately I didn't feature.""",2019-07-23 07:00:00+00:00,"['city', 'exit', 'everton', 'won', 'winning', 'im', 'title', 'fabian', 'sent', 'mentality', 'delph', 'team', 'trophy', 'manchester', 'aim', 'win']",Ghana,news article,English
139,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka's food production hit by extreme drought followed by floods - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/sri-lankas-food-production-hit-by-extreme-drought-followed-by-floods/,"A severe drought followed by heavy rainfalls in Sri Lanka has hit large swaths of cropping areas, threatening the food security of some 900,000 people, according to a report published last week by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).

According to the joint Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission, drought conditions in 2016 and early 2017 led to widespread crop failures, in particular for rice paddy - the country’s staple food. Total paddy production in 2017 is forecast at 2.7 million tonnes, almost 40 per cent less than the last year’s output and 35 per cent lower than the average of the previous five years.

Other crops, including various pulses, chillies and onion, which rely mainly on rainwater, were also heavily damaged by the dry weather.

The situation was exacerbated by subsequent heavy rainfalls in May. Floods and landslides in the south-western parts of the country caused deaths, large population displacements and damage to infrastructure. The rains did not ease the water supply constraints in the drought-impacted north-central and eastern parts of the country.

Now, nearly 225,000 households (or about 900,000 people) face food insecurity. The most vulnerable groups are struggling to earn an income after losing their own crops and have fewer employment opportunities.

In ten districts, a previous joint assessment showed that about one third of the drought-affected population had its regular income reduced by more than half, compared to the income generated from the 2015 to 2016 Maha season.

The situation may further deteriorate if the next cropping season fails. Due to a critical shortage of seeds and a lack of water for irrigation, the second 2017 paddy harvest - known as Yala, due to be harvested in August and September - is forecast at 1.2 million tonnes, 24 per cent below last year’s level.

Increasing food insecurity

Most families surveyed would usually grow their own food, but with the bad main harvest, many are now forced to buy food from local markets, where food prices have risen sharply. Rice prices reached an all-time high in January 2017 reducing the ability of families to access nutritious food.

Many of those affected have been forced to eat less. Interviews with households and market vendors showed that people were buying cheaper food whenever possible. Many reported a reduction in the purchase of meat and fish.

Urgent assistance required

To cover immediate needs, FAO and WFP call for the urgent provision of seeds as well as planting and irrigation equipment for the next Maha planting season from September to December, as well as support for irrigation systems.

The poorest and most vulnerable families should also quickly receive targeted cash assistance in order to ensure adequate food intake and to prevent families from incurring unsustainably high debt or adopting other coping mechanisms that affect them negatively over the longer term.

Recognising the increasing frequency of natural disasters affecting the agricultural sector and the impact on food security, it is also recommended to introduce longer-term measures to increase farmers’ and households’ resilience to natural disasters and climate change, such as promotion of drought tolerant crops and varieties and livelihood diversification.",2017-06-27 07:00:00+00:00,"['families', 'extreme', 'income', 'followed', 'sri', 'households', 'lankas', 'drought', 'hit', 'food', 'security', 'irrigation', 'production', 'crops', 'floods', '2017', 'paddy']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

The 18-year-old will continue his career at Merkur Spiel-Arena after completing a transfer on Tuesday

German Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Dusseldorf have added a third Ghanaian to their roster with the signing of Kelvin Ofori of Right to Dream Academy fame.

The teenager joins the Flingeraner on a three-year contract after impressing on trial.

He teams up with compatriots Bernard Tekpetey and Nana Ampomah who both sealed moves to the club earlier this summer.

""Fortuna Dusseldorf have contracted offensive player Kelvin Ofori,"" the club announced on their official website on Tuesday.

""The 18-year-old offensive talent from Ghana has signed a contract until 2022 and will hence play with the No. 14 at the back of his jersey.""

Ofori's highlight during his trial period was finding the back of the net in a 2-1 pre-season triumph over Belgian side Anderlecht.

""I am very pleased to have signed my first professional contract with such a traditional club as Fortuna Dusseldorf,"" said the teenager.

""The Bundesliga is one of the best leagues in the world. I want to learn a lot here as a young player and develop myself step by step.

""The team and the whole club have helped me a lot in the first few weeks and I cannot wait to play in front of the great fans.""

Ofori could make his competitive debut for Dusseldorf on Saturday when the Flingeraner face Villingen in the German Cup.

""Kelvin Ofori is a great talent in Ghana and we are very happy that he has chosen Fortuna,"" club board member Lutz Pfannenstiel remarked.

""He has a great technique and his pace makes him hard to defend.

""We are convinced that he can develop as best as possible with us.""

2454,FL-2017-000067-BRA,UPDATE 2-Brazil's central bank to flood lenders with fresh liquidity - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-brazil-banks-idUSL1N2BG0IX,"(Adds more measures, central bank president quotes)

BRASILIA, March 23 (Reuters) - Brazil’s central bank on Monday said it planned to inject 1.2 trillion reais ($233.81 billion) into the country’s financial system to counteract the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, with more than half that amount comprising loans to banks.

Under the program, lenders will be able to package their loan portfolios into long-term deposits to be acquired by the central bank in a move aimed at freeing up 670 billion reais for fresh loans.

The bank loans are part of a raft of steps the Brazilian central bank announced aimed at keeping consumers and companies borrowing amid the coronavirus outbreak that it said would collectively make available the equivalent of 16.7% of Brazil’s gross domestic product in fresh cash.

“This is the biggest liquidity injection ever announced by the central bank,” Central bank President Roberto Campos Neto said in a conference call with reporters. “We understand that the acquisition of long-term deposits backed by banks’ loans will allow money to get to companies.”

New regulations governing the letters of credit backed by loans will be released soon, Campos Neto added.

Shares in Brazil’s biggest lenders were underperforming the Bovespa stock exchange index, amid concerns on credit deliquencies amid the coronavirus outbreak, with shares in Itau Unibanco Holdings SA and Banco Bradesco SA down 8% and Banco do Brasil SA losing 9%.

The central bank also cut long-term reserve requirements to 17% from 25%, freeing up 68 billion reais currently in compulsory deposits with the central bank to banks.

It also announced measures allowing small and mid-sized lenders to issue up to 2 billion reais in special long-term bonds guaranteed by a privately held deposit insurance fund, limited to an amount equivalent to its shareholders’ equity.

The central bank estimates the measure will allow banks to extend up to 200 billion reais in new loans.

The central bank said it will also extend loans backed by corporate bonds to financial institutions between March 23 and April 30 to add liquidity to their investment funds.

The Brazilian central bank last week allowed lenders to offer firms and households in good financial shape increased loans and better terms over the next six months, besides lowering capital requirements.

Campos Neto added the central bank may further lower reserve requirements and announce other additional measures if necessary.

Wheat production will likely be 28% below the five-year average, with a deficit of 2.5 million tonnes

275 000 people displaced by drought as of September 2018

42% of the population reported a decrease in income compared with last year

92% of farmers reported insufficient or no seeds for the next planting season

48% of pastoralists reported reduced livestock productivity and an increase in animal deaths

Key points

• Most households are moving to cities, distress selling livestock, reducing planting area, skipping meals or eating poor quality food. Overuse of these emergency livelihood coping techniques will compromise their ability to recover asset losses and deal with future shocks.

• Without assistance, the food security and livelihood situation will not improve and could deteriorate.

• Affected populations require urgent agricultural inputs in time for the winter planting season and livestock protection for the peak harsh winter months up to February 2019 in the main 12 drought‑affected provinces.

Planned response

• Distribute certified wheat seeds and quality fertilizer to 102 000 households (714 000 people) in December–January

• Distribute concentrated feed and de-worming to 61 200 households (428 000 people) throughout the winter

• Provide wheat seeds to 17 600 households (123 200 people) by December

• Provide livestock protection support (feed and fodder) to 142 000 households (994 000 people) by January

2147,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Heavy rains may mar quality of Ugandan coffee crop: official - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-coffee-idUSKBN2330PZ,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - The quality of Uganda’s coffee crop may decline in the coming months as heavy rains across the east African nation have reduced the amount of sunshine necessary for bean drying, an industry official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Uganda is Africa’s largest exporter of coffee followed by Ethiopia and grows mostly robusta variety.

The country has been pounded by unusually heavy rains that started in August resulting in deaths, displacement and extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure.

Western Uganda, including the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains that are among the biggest coffee growing areas, has received some of the most intense rains.

“The drying process is a major problem in most of the places...the weather is not good for drying,” David Muwonge, head of marketing at the National Union of Coffee Agribusiness and Farmer Enterprises (NUCAFE) told Reuters.

“There’s a higher risk of beans becoming mouldy unless farmers are well sensitised.”

Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), the state-run regulator, forecasts Uganda’s bean exports will climb 16% to 5.1 million 60-kg (132-pound) bags in the current crop year ending September.

The country’s coffee output has surged in recent years, the fruition of a government programme that has been distributing free seedlings to farmers to expand acreage and replace aging trees.

Authorities say their target is to help boost annual production to 20 million bags by 2025.

The beans have traditionally been Uganda’s biggest commodity export but were recently overtaken by gold which now annually earns the country over $1 billion.

Muwonge said the damage to transport infrastructure by the rains and flooding was likely slow the flow of beans from farms and collection centres from some of the deep rural areas.",2020-05-26 07:00:00+00:00,"['drying', 'farmers', 'official', 'crop', 'quality', 'beans', 'million', 'coffee', 'damage', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'mar', 'ugandas', 'heavy', 'told']",Uganda,news article,English
663,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ministry Retrieve 500 Excavators From Illegal Mining Sites - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/ministry-retrieve-500-excavators-from-illegal-mining-sites/,"The Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Mr John Peter Amewu, on Wednesday said 500 excavators have, so far, been retrieved from mining sites with 1,148 dredges taken from major rivers in the country.

He said the Ministry would collaborate with the Ministry of Environment, Science, Innovation and Technology, to establish a desk to combat illicit mining and crack the whip on anyone involved.

Mr Amewu said this when he toured some mining sites in the Upper West Akyem Municipality, Atiwa East and Denkyemboar districts in the Eastern Region.

The tour followed a three-week ultimatum the Minister gave to illegal miners to evacuate their machines and leave all mining sites. The ultimatum expired on Tuesday, April 18.

The team, comprising officials of the Minerals Commission as well as some police personnel, visited communities including Akenten, Pianaman, Moseaso and Kubriso.

Some illegal miners who were working on some concessions left the site upon seeing the team.

There were excavators abandoned at the mining sites while others were packed in front of houses.

The Minister called on the Environmental Protection Agency to collaborate with the Minerals Commission in monitoring the various miming sites to ensure licensed mining firms reclaimed the lands concurrently while mining went on.

He said there was the need for a sustained fight against illegal mining and called for collective efforts by all stakeholders including the traditional authorities, land owners, the media, civil society organisations and politicians to help stop the practice.

Mr Amewu gave the assurance that the Government would sustain the fight for the next five years.

Dr Tony Aubynn, the Chief Executive Officer of the Minerals Commission, said the key stakeholders supposed to combat the menace had been complicit and, therefore, called for collaborative efforts to deal decisively with the challenge.

Illegal mining, otherwise known as galamsey, had degraded the environment and polluted water bodies all over the country.

The Abontendomhene of Kyebi, Nana Boakye Dankwa, who later received the Minister and his entourage, charged the Government to sustain the fight against illegal mining and prosecute persons involved.

He said illegal mining had destroyed their water bodies and vegetations and urged the Government to stop a mining firm, Extra Gold, from operating in the area since its activities had destroyed the environment.

Mr. Devananda told Parliament that Coca Cola was planning to shift the largest manufacturing plant owned by it in South Asia, which was initially situated in India, to Sri Lanka.

He therefore cautioned the government stating that the company has ran into trouble in India in addition to using up much of the water resources in the sub-continent.

The MP noted that at present Coca Cola was facing widespread criticism in India.

“There are around 57 Coca Cola plants currently operating in India and they too have come under fire from the Indian legal system for violating the stipulated water usage limits. Furthermore, there is a severe drought affecting Indians and Indian courts have banned the company from utilizing water from the Thamirabarani River,” he said.

“Sri Lanka too is facing a serious drought. Several districts have no water.

827,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: President Launches Community Mining Programme - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907260690.html,"press release

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has launched a Community Mining Programme (CMP) at Wassa Akropong, in the Western Region.

The Community Mining Programme is aimed at formalizing mining in selected communities across the country.

With at least one community mine expected to be set up in each of the mining districts in the country, the community mines are expected to provide job openings for over 4,500 miners that were trained by the government at the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Tarkwa.

At the ceremony to launch the pilot programme on Wednesday, President Akufo-Addo said the Community Mining Programme would ensure that ""mining will be done the right way, within the tenets of the law, and will not destroy our natural resources.""

He said, ""Today, we are launching a type of mining that will benefit all of us. I am here to plead with the young men who are participating in the community mining to do their best to adhere to all the laws and do a good job so that money will return to Wassa Amenfi. The money will come.""

He assured that the programme would be replicated in other towns in Ghana by September this year, and would be closely monitored to ensure that the standards that have been set for the CMP are adhered to.

The Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Prof. Kwabena Frimpong Boateng said the Minerals Commission had acquired several zones in each of the mining districts for this purpose, with some traditional authorities also providing land for the CMP.

He said some large-scale mining companies have shed off areas to be used for the CMP, and, between now and September, concessions for the various CMP would be mapped out by the IMCIM Mapping Team and uploaded onto the GalamStop software.

Prof. Frimpong Boateng stressed that canoes fitted with outboard motors have been procured for the Riverine Team to monitor the water bodies.

Gibson will pay the mother of his 22 month-old daughter $750,000 and get joint custody of the child, ending a bitter custody and financial dispute that badly damaged his Hollywood career.[Photo/Agencies]

Actor Mel Gibson will pay the mother of his 22 month-old daughter $750,000 and get joint custody of the child, ending a bitter custody and financial dispute that badly damaged his Hollywood career.

The ""Braveheart"" director and his former musician girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva agreed to a settlement detailed in a Los Angeles Superior Court hearing on Wednesday following a more than year-long war of words.

Judge Peter Lichtman banned both Gibson and Grigorieva from writing books about their relationship, which unraveled in early 2010 amid accusations of violence and extortion.

""I would like to thank your honor for bringing this matter to a reasonable conclusion,"" Gibson told Lichtman at Wednesday's hearing.

Grigorieva, who had been seeking millions of dollars from the Oscar-winning actor, thanked Lichtman for ""the tremendous help to resolve this situation.""

The acrimony between the couple became public a year ago when taped phone calls were leaked online in which Gibson was heard ranting, cursing and insulting Grigorieva.

The leak appeared to have been aimed at putting pressure on the actor to increase an initial settlement offer to Grigorieva that was reported to be around $15 million. Los Angeles prosecutors later decided against charging Grigorieva with extortion.

In March, Gibson admitted slapping Grigorieva during an argument and was sentenced to three years probation.

The widely-heard tapes further tarnished a reputation damaged by Gibson's 2006 anti-Semitic tirade following a drunk driving arrest in Malibu.

His manager quit, he lost a cameo role in ""The Hangover: Part Two"" because other people refused to work with him, and the release of his movie ""The Beaver"" was delayed and ultimately flopped at box offices in May.

Gibson, who was once estimated to be worth $900 million after a string of hit movies like ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The passion of the Christ"", reached a private settlement with his wife Robyn in June that wrapped up their divorce after 28 years of marriage.",2011-09-01 07:00:00+00:00,"['damaged', 'mel', 'financial', 'lichtman', 'gibson', 'settles', '750000', 'custody', 'grigorieva', 'los', 'angeles', 'settlement']",China,news article,English
660,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ireland steps up its humanitarian response to looming famine in Somalia - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/ireland-steps-its-humanitarian-response-looming-famine-somalia,"- Airlift of 100 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies dispatched to Somalia

Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan T.D., and Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development, Joe McHugh T.D., announced that Ireland has today (Wednesday) dispatched over 100 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies to Somalia.

Announcing the airlift, Minister Flanagan said:

“I am deeply concerned that over 6 million people in Somalia are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Almost 3 million people are facing crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity and there is a very real and significant risk that the situation will further deteriorate to famine, causing starvation and death. This is simply unacceptable in our world of plenty.

“In Somalia today there are worrying similarities to the conditions that led to the worst famine of the 21st century when, in 2011, three-quarters of a million Somali people faced famine and more than a quarter million lives were lost. A massive and urgent scale up of assistance by the international community is required to avoid a similar catastrophe this year. Acting now will save lives.

“Over 400,000 people have been displaced in the country over the last six month because of prolonged drought, loss of livelihoods and acute hunger. They are congregating in informal settlements with nothing, arriving with only what they can carry. Most have walked long distances to reach these camps in hope that they will receive some assistance. Ireland’s donation of emergency supplies that we are announcing today will help to meet the immediate needs of up to 4,000 displaced families.”

“Today Ireland will dispatch an airlift, worth over €600,000, from the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai, where Irish Aid pre-positions relief supplies for use in emergencies and humanitarian crises under Ireland’s Rapid Response Initiative.

“The relief supplies, including blankets, jerry cans, cooking sets, family hygiene kits, tarpaulins and solar lamps, will arrive in two loads into Mogadishu today (Wednesday) and Friday, and will be distributed by Concern Worldwide to 4,000 vulnerable families displaced by drought and acute hunger to informal settlements located outside of Mogadishu and Baidoa, and in the Afgoyee Corridor, north-west of Mogadishu.

“Last month, Ireland also announced new funding of €11 million to humanitarian crises in the Horn of Africa region, €3 million of which was contributed to the UN-managed Somalia Humanitarian Fund to help our partners to provide life-saving assistance to those most in need and at risk of famine in the country.”

Minister McHugh added:

“Severe drought conditions continue in many parts of Somalia following poor and erratic rains over the last two years. In the worst affected areas, poor rainfall has destroyed crops and killed livestock, and communities are being forced to sell their assets, and borrow food, to survive.

“If the forthcoming rainy season from April to June is as poor as is currently forecast, this hunger crisis will worsen and further displacement will occur. The situation for children is especially grave with over 360,000 Somali children under the age of five now acutely malnourished.

“Urgent action is required to provide emergency shelter and basic services for families that have been forced to move. Ireland is responding quickly through one of our trusted NGO partners. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.”

594,Drought Sri Lanka,"Drought is not just about water. It affects air pollution, too - Science Magazine",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/drought-not-just-about-water-it-affects-air-pollution-too,"Drought is not just about water. It affects air pollution, too

The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.

Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.

Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.

California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.

The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology . Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.

After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.

The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.

Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.

The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”",2019-04-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['levels', 'affects', 'plants', 'ozone', 'water', 'voc', 'atmospheric', 'drought', 'air', 'states', 'pollution', 'isoprene']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
496,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Recommendations for addressing drought displacement in Somalia - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/recommendations-addressing-drought-displacement-somalia,"Introduction

Somalia is one of the countries most heavily affected by internal displacement, with more than 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) at the end of 2019.1 Many of these IDPs were displaced as a result of conflict and violence, but many more were displaced during disasters, including floods and drought. In addition to human suffering and insecurity, internal displacement was estimated to have cost the country 21.5 per cent of its GDP, or $1 billion in 2019.2 It is not only a humanitarian priority but also a challenge for socioeconomic development.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) embarked on a research programme in December 2018 to investigate internal displacement associated with slowonset disasters and environmental change.3 As part of that programme, Somali-speaking local enumerators collected quantitative and qualitative data in October 2019 in the cities of Burco in Togdheer region, Galkayo in Mudug and Qardho in Bari to examine displacement associated with drought.4 The objectives of the study were to investigate the interplay between different drivers and drought in triggering displacement from rural to urban areas, as well as to provide a better understanding of conditions and priorities for local integration and returns. The overall goal was to support policy and programming for durable solutions.

Amid growing needs and the risk of future displacement resulting from drought, IDMC engaged with key humanitarian actors in Somalia to identify recommendations for addressing the issue more efficiently. Building on the study conducted in July 2019, a workshop was organized in November 2020.

This paper presents the key recommendations resulting from that workshop. Participants identified areas for different types of interventions, illustrated in the map below. These include climate-sensitive agriculture and innovative, climate-related solutions for seeds and production. They also include naturebased solutions, such as permaculture and regreening, in areas outside of urban centres that receive less attention (in blue); the provision of safety nets, skills training, drought insurance schemes, small business grants and unconditional cash transfers in urban areas with high numbers of IDPs (in yellow); and assessments to determine levels of tenure security, the generation of title deeds for land and the provision of specialized legal aid services in informal settlements and urban IDP sites (in orange).

Four challenges were discussed during the workshop and are analysed in the following sections:",2021-04-19 07:00:00+00:00,"['addressing', 'areas', 'idps', 'displaced', 'recommendations', 'displacement', 'drought', 'study', 'urban', 'internal', 'solutions', 'workshop', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

443,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"Drought, Conflict and Regional Unrest Producing Dire Consequences for Afghan Food Security - Future Directions International",https://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/drought-conflict-and-regional-unrest-producing-dire-consequences-for-afghan-food-security/,"Background

Along with worsening conflict and a precarious economic outlook, one of the worst droughts in decades is compounding food insecurity in Afghanistan, especially in the north and west of the country. A La Niña event has caused a rain and snow deficit of 70 per cent this year and the wheat production forecast looks grim. As the drought has worsened, there has been a 45 per cent reduction in agricultural output this year. This is a further fall from 2017’s figures, which saw wheat production fall 57 per cent below the five-year average.

Comment

Afghanistan relies on agriculture as the backbone of its economy. It employs 44 per cent of the workforce and contributes 25 per cent of GDP. In better years, it drives economic growth and provides some form of income to 61 per cent of households. Agriculture could set Afghanistan up for significant economic transformation, if not for its exposure to a series of calamities that have engulfed the country.

The first of those calamities is drought. Though water shortages have not been uncommon in Afghanistan over the last decade, the 2018 drought has been especially alarming. Over 250,000 people have been displaced and a further 1.4 million people require humanitarian assistance, due to poor rainfall. In Badghis province, 95 per cent of cropland has become unusable, as have pastures for livestock. This is made worse by haphazard approaches to water management.

Irrigation, for instance, tends to be practiced in traditional ways, as rainfall is unpredictable, making irrigation central to agriculture. Usually this means using canals. That is by far the most common method in Afghanistan; 75 per cent of crops are irrigated using this way. The use of canals is fine when water is plentiful, but it relies on snowmelt, which has been scarce this year. It also tends to waste significantly more water than many modern methods of irrigation, waste that Afghanistan can ill afford.

Conflict has also had serious consequences for the development of agriculture in Afghanistan. Low rainfall and high temperatures have been the primary driver of the drought, but decades of conflict have also helped shape the conditions that have led to a crisis. Again, irrigation has an important role here. As the fighting has continued, canal management has collapsed. Though recent conflict related damage has not been assessed, irrigated land has declined by more than half since 1978 and many canals no longer deliver water.

Water has also been used as a weapon of war. Allegations recently surfaced that the Taliban blocked the flow of water to farmers to force their compliance with demands. Worsening conflict in 2018 has also been partially responsible for driving down economic growth, causing low rates of employment and high consumer prices. All of this is making access to food more difficult for many people.

Regional developments have also influenced Afghanistan’s economic prospects and affected its access to other suppliers and the availability of food. Iran’s faltering economy has forced 552,000 Afghans out of the Islamic Republic since the start of 2018, many of whom were deported suddenly. Those left in Iran face shrinking incomes due to a shortage of work. That has meant fewer remittances to Afghanistan from Iran, which normally makes up at least 40 per cent of total remittances. Iran is also facing a major drought of its own. Increasingly politicised rhetoric over water sharing on the Helmand River is making it more and more difficult for Afghanistan to effectively utilise its surface water for agricultural development.

It is possible for Afghanistan to improve its food security prospects, but doing so will rely on bringing peace to a war-torn country, prudent economic management, building climate-resilient agriculture, and strong hydro diplomacy. Considering the hurdles that it faces, it is likely that Afghanistan’s food and water security will remain precarious for the foreseeable future.",2018-10-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['food', 'water', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'security', 'producing', 'regional', 'afghanistan', 'conflict', 'consequences', 'dire', 'making', 'unrest', 'afghan', 'economic', 'cent', 'agriculture']",Afghanistan,news article,English

Reports from the U.N. and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow following crop failures in some areas and livestock dying for the want of anything to eat.

Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 percent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.

In a regular update, the U.N. humanitarian office reported that 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in Qala-e-Naw city in Badghis province in the week to Sept. 9.

A second U.N. report, with data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month. It estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.

In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.

The U.N. cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International that 99 percent of people in Badghis said their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.

""The assessment also indicates that most farmers lost last season's harvest and nearly all of them lack seeds for new planting season,"" the U.N. report said, noting reports that about 40 per cent of livestock has been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder.

The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a U.S. funded food security monitoring service, said in a report on Aug. 31 that the number of Afghans in a food ""crisis"" was atypically high.

""Crisis"" is step three on a five step scale, where four is ""emergency"" and five is ""catastrophe"" and possible famine.

In Badghis and Faryab provinces, emergency outcomes are expected to emerge in January, FEWS NET said.

""Normally during this time period, food security outcomes begin to seasonally improve in much of the country, but due to drought and severe reduction in wheat production, reduced labor opportunities, and continued conflict more households face Crisis outcomes than normal,"" it said.",2018-09-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'food', 'step', 'badghis', 'drought', 'million', 'worse', 'seeds', 'conflict', 'report', 'aid', 'outcomes']",Afghanistan,news article,English

A recent Food and Nutrition report estimates 1.4 million people are currently food insecure and this number could increase to 2.3 million by March 2017.

In 2016, UNICEF and the Ministry of Health trained mobile brigades have screened more than 118,000 children for severe acute malnutrition and treated more than 8,100 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

UNICEF is conducting assessments on nutrition to determine the need for increased interventions in Maputo, Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Zambezia and some districts in Sofala province.

In 2016, UNICEF has reached over 23,900 people with safe water through water trucking and point-of-use water treatment in Magude district.

There have been no outbreaks of cholera reported in the country since August 2016. However, UNICEF continues to support the Government with disease surveillance and preparedness, particularly in high risk districts.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The El Niño drought continues to affect 1.4 million people in Mozambique according to the most recent SETSAN (Technical Secretariat for Food Security and Nutrition) report released in September 2016. Although there is a slight decrease in the overall number of food insecure people from 1.5 million reported in July to 1.4 million reported in September, the report projects that the number of people experiencing food insecurity and nutrition crisis could reach 2.3 million between October 2016 and March 2017. The assessment was used to guide revisions of the Strategic Response Plan (SRP) and to develop scenarios under the Government’s national contingency plan for the 2016-2017 rainy and cyclone season.

Results from the SETSAN assessment contributed to the government’s decision to extend the Red Alert for the time being. UNICEF is conducting complementary assessments on nutrition in the IPC 2-3 level provinces to determine the need for increased interventions in Maputo, Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Zambezia and some districts in Sofala province.

The forecasts of the National Meteorological Institute for Mozambique indicate normal to above normal rainfall for the period October to December 2016 in the south and central provinces (Figure 1), and normal to above normal for the period January to March 2017 in Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia (Figure 2). However, the northern parts of Nampula and Gaza expect below normal rainfall between January and March 2017. The implications for drought impact and risks to children are the beginning of a long recovery from food and water shortages, complicated by moderate to high risks of flooding and displacement between January and March 2017 in some parts of northern provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, central provinces of Zambezia, Manica and Sofala, and southern provinces of Inhambane and Maputo.",2016-10-31 07:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'children', 'humanitarian', 'drought', 'report', 'unicef', 'food', 'provinces', 'normal', 'situation', 'million', 'nutrition', 'zambezia', '2016', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English

Our editors’ weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.

On our radar

Ethiopian PM in Sudan mediation effort

On Friday, Abiy Ahmed began mediation talks in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, aimed at restarting negotiations between Sudan’s military rulers and the opposition. The urgent efforts of Ethiopia’s young reformist prime minister follow the worst violence since the ouster of former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir two months ago. At least 100 people were reported to have been killed on Monday when members of the Rapid Support Forces – linked to the notorious Janjaweed militia – attacked a Khartoum protest. The protestors want immediate civilian-led rule and for militias to hand over their weapons to the army. One man holding the keys to the negotiations is Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemeti"" Dagolo, an ex-Janjaweed commander and the No. 2 in the ruling military junta. Dagalo, a former al-Bashir ally whose forces are accused of war crimes in Darfur, has been the lead in recent negotiations with Western diplomats.

Bad numbers in Libya

It has been two months since fighting began around Libya’s capital of Tripoli. The numbers speak for themselves: more than 90,000 people have fled their homes, 100,000 civilians are said to still be near conflict zones (41 have been reported killed, with another 116 injured since 4 April). On Monday, almost 100 people were brought out of Zintan, a Tripoli migrant detention centre where UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, described conditions as “dire.” That brings the number of migrants and refugees held in Tripoli down, but not necessarily in the country as a whole. That’s because people are still trying to escape Libya, only to end up right back where they started. UNHCR says it evacuated or resettled 1,000 people out of the country in all of 2019. Last month alone more than 1,200 people were taken to detention centres by the Libyan Coast Guard after they were rescued or intercepted at sea. Given the horrific conditions documented by aid agencies and here at TNH, these numbers are cause for concern.

Cash injection for Horn drought

A UN fund has released $45 million to combat the effects of drought in parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Announcing the decision, UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said Somalia would get the bulk of the funds, $30 million, after forecasters predicted a failure of the April to June rainy season. Some 2.2 million Somalis are expected to face severe food problems by September. The new allocation is roughly 10 percent of the Central Emergency Response Fund's annual spending. The CERF is a pooled fund whose biggest donors last year were the UK, Germany, and Sweden. The Somalia NGO Consortium warned last month that the donor reaction to new projections on food security and nutrition had been sluggish, with director Nasra Ismail describing it as ""very concerning"" not to see ""strong commitments"". Keep an eye out next week for our Africa drought round-up, looking at southern Africa as well as the Horn.

Mergers and acquisitions

Are there too many NGOs overlapping and competing with each other? The UK manager at Mercy Corps – one of the BINGOs (Big International NGOs) – thinks so. Simon O’Connell points out that there are 115 international NGOs working in South Sudan, most with separate arrangements for accommodation, transport, and security. Adding to that apparent duplication, coordination between so many players is itself an effort, argued O'Connell in a recent commentary. The recipients of aid, and the public who are asked to fill the collection tin, may find this all less than ideal. ""There are too many organisations duplicating each other’s work and needlessly competing with each other,"" O’Connell wrote. To hear more about his proposals to merge NGOs together, tune in to a discussion hosted at the Overseas Development Institute this Tuesday, 11 June.

Weighing need

Until recently, there was no agreed ranking of the severity of humanitarian need – no fair way to know which place is worst off. To address the “apples and oranges” problem, humanitarian analysts have agreed on a pilot index that combines 31 variables across three ""dimensions"". The Global Crisis Severity Index combines indicators of impact, conditions of affected people, and complexity. That could make for some necessary comparisons: according to this system, Venezuela is more severe than Central African Republic. These measures are a key ingredient in a new service from humanitarian needs analysts ACAPS. Its latest offering adds measures of risk and humanitarian access to the cocktail as part of a new resource called CrisisInSight.

In case you missed it CAMEROON: Hundreds of opposition members are still being held in Cameroon after a government protest crackdown last week. More than 350 people were arrested, including hundreds from the main opposition party. Protests have been mounting against President Paul Biya and his government over the release of opposition leader Maurice Kamto. COLOMBIA: One third of the 6,000 FARC fighters who handed in their weapons as part of a 2016 peace accord have taken up arms again and joined dozens of “dissident” groups operating in the coca-producing regions the FARC once controlled, Reuters reports, citing a confidential military intelligence report. For more, read our recent report on dissident groups in Tumaco. INDIA: Drought in India’s western state of Maharashtra has sent vegetable prices soaring by 50 percent in the last week, according to local media. Farmers also reportedly sowed only one third of their recent crop, while late monsoon rains are raising fears for the upcoming harvest. Several Indian states are facing the worst drought in years, which is having a life-altering impact on land-dependent farmers. MEXICO-US: Mexico agreed to deploy 6,000 National Guard personnel to its southern border with Guatemala to stem the flow of migrants as it seeks to ward off tariffs on Mexican goods threatened by US President Donald Trump. SRI LANKA: A Catholic Pakistani family seeking asylum in Sri Lanka is facing imminent deportation. Amnesty International fears the situation is part of an anti-Muslim backlash that has also hit refugees and asylum seekers following April’s Easter Sunday attacks, which killed more than 250 people. This week, all nine Muslim members of parliament resigned, urging the government to protect civilians from hate crimes. YEMEN: The Yemen Data Project said it recorded 149 civilian casualties from airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia- and UAE-led coalition in May, including 41 deaths and 108 injuries – the highest figures since last October.

Four nights this Ramadan, under the shadow of refugee returns in Lebanon Mariam Al Kotob/TNH

It’s not just in Lebanon that governments are increasingly putting pressure on Syrian refugees to return: it’s happening in Turkey, in Jordan, even in European countries. Journalist Laura Gottesdiener spent this Ramadan in one Lebanese neighbourhood where such pressures are beginning to be felt acutely, especially as the government has announced plans to demolish informal camps that house around 5,000 Syrian families elsewhere in the country. What she found will perhaps surprise many. Yes, there were problems – grumbles over government incompetence, corruption, international aid bureaucracy. But Jabel Beddawi, a community of Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians – almost all refugees from war – was thriving despite it all. In turbulent times, particularly for those living far from their homelands, Gottesdiener’s tale is one of hope: “At no other time of the year is the daily resistance – to hatred, austerity, and exile – more evident than over Ramadan: the Muslim holy month that ended this week and during which daily fasting transforms, each night at sunset, into collective feasts.” The illustrations themselves, from Mariam al Kotob, are a feast for the soul. Enjoy.

And finally…

It’s a question close to our hearts here at TNH. A lot of what we cover falls into the neglected crisis category – whether that’s media neglect or actual neglect from governments or the aid community. Every year, the Norwegian Refugee Council publishes a list of the 10 most neglected displacement crises and this year its top three are Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic. “Large-scale displacement and soaring humanitarian needs in the English-speaking parts of Cameroon have been met with deafening silence,” its report says. We wouldn’t quibble with any of the suggestions on this list, nor with the NRC’s depressing conclusion: “The level of media attention is not necessarily proportional to the size of the crisis. Even when the media does report on a conflict, the situation for civilians may be overshadowed by coverage of war strategies, political alliances and fighting between armed groups.” Click on the countries above for our latest reporting, or here for own list of 10 humanitarian crises and trends to watch in 2019.

222,Drought Sri Lanka,Somaliland's hunger crisis: ‘The world doesn't respond until children are dying' - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/24/somaliland-hunger-crisis-world-doesnt-respond-until-children-are-dying-foreign-minister-saad-ali-shire,"Somaliland’s foreign minister has said that the international community’s refusal to recognise the republic 26 years after it declared independence means aid is taking far longer to reach people on the brink of famine.

Though Somaliland, on the Gulf of Aden, has 4.4 million inhabitants and its own currency, army and parliament, in the eyes of the world it is part of war-torn Somalia. More than 1.5 million people have been affected by the drought afflicting the state, and most of its livestock has been wiped out. In recent days, the drought has been compounded by an outbreak of cholera in the east.

Saad Ali Shire, Somaliland’s foreign minister, said: “Lack of recognition is proving a major problem. We do not receive bilateral aid. All aid goes to the third parties via the UN. The UN has very professional people, but the bureaucracy that goes with these many channels is huge, and there is a high administrative cost. If we were recognised, we could receive aid bilaterally, and attract international investors – so creating a more resilient economy that is less dependent on livestock.

“I don’t think people took our warnings of famine seriously until the start of the year. It seems the international community does not seem to respond until there are emaciated and dying children on their TV screens.

“The assistance now through the UN is very slow and bureaucratic. There is no lack of will, but it often takes months for aid to reach the country as it has to go through so many levels.”

Somaliland, a former British colony, declared independence from Somalia in 1991 and has been praised for its relative political stability and lack of conflict.

Now, the country’s leaders are reopening a battle for diplomatic recognition, believing that if they can persuade one swing state in the African Union, such as Ghana, to recognise the country, the rest of the international community will follow. The drought, and crisis in neighbouring Somalia, have added to the urgency.

“We have always had droughts, but they used to be once every 10 years. Now they are once every two years due to climate change,” said Shire. “This year, we have had the worst drought in living memory across east Africa.

“The drought has destroyed 80% of the country’s cattle and we are a pastoral economy. The bureaucracy has been so slow that in large parts of the country little or no aid has arrived.”

Others estimate that about half of the country’s 18 million livestock have died.

Shire claimed the Somali government in Mogadishu was increasingly assertive in trying to appropriate a disproportionate amount of international aid sent to the region.

The UK and the US are by far the two largest donors to the UN famine appeal and have been at the forefront of efforts to rouse the international community to improve security inside Somalia.

Insisting that its claim for legal recognition would not worsen Somalia’s existing problems, Shire said: “We have stood the test of time. We have lasted 26 years. We are a mature democracy and country, and we believe in democracy.”

The UN has expressed concern that presidential elections in Somaliland would not be held until November, but Shire said they had been delayed due to drought and promised they would go ahead.

“From 1991 to 1997, we had conflict, civil wars and upheavals, but we have managed to resolve these issues – unlike Somalia – through reconciliation, demobilisation and better governance,” he said.

Shire said the international community was spending $2bn (£1.5m) a year to improve security in Somalia and questioned the point of giving it new weapons. “We suffer from the syndrome of being the good child. Naughty children get all the attention. The international community seems to be willing to reward failure, and penalise success.



“Somalia would benefit from our independence. We would be be able to share our experience with them on how to achieve reconciliation and prosperity. We want nothing from Somalia. We do not want land or money from them. We want our independence.”

He also urged the international community to rebuff Somalia’s recent call for a lifting of the arms embargo to defeat Islamic militants al-Shabaab. “The place is already awash with weapons. What they need to do is gain the confidence of the people. The government does not need new arms. It needs to collect the weapons that are already there.”",2017-05-24 07:00:00+00:00,"['international', 'world', 'country', 'children', 'hunger', 'dying', 'drought', 'somalia', 'shire', 'community', 'crisis', 'doesnt', 'aid', 'somaliland', 'foreign', 'respond', 'weapons', 'somalilands']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

1455,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Time to build an ark? More flooding expected in the future - constructconnect.com - Journal of Commerce,https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/infrastructure/2018/05/time-build-ark-flooding-expected-future,"As a winter without end finally gives way to warm spring temperatures, rivers choked with ice and swollen with runoff are causing floods in many parts of Canada.

At the beginning of May, parts of Alberta, Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and, especially, New Brunswick were under water.

As soggy as the situation is now, many regions of Canada are likely to experience more flooding in the future, says Shawna Peddle, director of Partners for Action in the University of Waterloo’s Faculty of Environment.

“There are many reasons,” said Peddle.

“For example, changing weather patterns and an increase in the number of storm cell events. In addition, there is more and more development and paving-over of formerly empty ground, so there are fewer wetlands to absorb run-off.”

On top of that, says Peddle, much of Canada’s water infrastructure is old and out of date, and unable to handle the increased water volumes caused by up-stream development.

Although some regions of the U.S., such as the lower Mississippi River valley, and some countries, such as the Netherlands, are more often under water than Canada, flooding is still the number one cause of insurance and personal losses in this country.

“Most people remember such major floods as Winnipeg in 1950 and 1997, and Calgary in 2013, but they might not know that every province experiences flooding each year,” said Peddle.

“Some of the floods take place in rural areas where relatively few people are affected, and those events might not make the news.”

Although no city or region can be made 100 per cent flood-proof, the risks of a good soaking can be reduced in a number of ways, says Peddle.

Examples include upgrading water-related infrastructure, updating building codes and encouraging closer inter-jurisdictional cooperation.

“Measures can be taken at all levels,” she said. “Everybody has a role to play.”

Another measure the country could take to keeping dry is to equip itself with up-to-date flood maps, says Tamsin Lyle, principal engineer at Ebbwater Consulting Inc. in Vancouver.

According to a report of the National Floodplain Mapping Assessment commissioned by Public Safety Canada, the country has mapped the geography of only 28,000 kilometres of waterways.

And although some provinces use once-in-100-years as the flood-risk standard, others use a more conservative once-in-500-years yardstick.

“The risks of flooding in many parts of Canada are growing because the country is growing and people and buildings are being added to vulnerable flood plains every year,” said Lyle.

While there are certainly benefits to living in cities that happen to be located on flood plains, there are also costs, and we need to become more conscious of them and take them into account as we build our cities, she says.

“And when we’re designing our solutions, we need to consider all of the potential natural disasters that could happen in the area, so that we don’t inadvertently worsen the fall-out from another kind of catastrophe,” Lyle said.

“We could, for example, put buildings on stilts, to keep them above water in the case of a flood. But those buildings could collapse if an earthquake struck.”

Dave Murray, a principal and water resource engineer in the Victoria office of consulting engineers Kerr Wood Leidal Associates Ltd., says Canada should look abroad for ideas on flood mitigation.

“We need to study the Netherlands’ Room for the River flood plain management program,” Murray said.

Keeping their heads above water has been a preoccupation of the Dutch since people started settling on the marshy soil near the North Sea.

Two-third of the Netherlands is below sea level. And the rivers which flow through the country on their way to the ocean overflow regularly.

In 1993 and 1995, severe flooding resulted in mass evacuations and left thousands of acres of farmland under water.

As a result, the Dutch government developed a program that enabled the rivers to safely handle greater volumes of water than in the past.

This was a major shift in Dutch flood mitigation thinking.

Before the 1990’s floods, the Netherlands relied primarily on dikes and berms to keep flood waters at bay.

The Dutch program creates “room for the river” in a number of ways — increasing stream depth, storing water, relocating dikes, creating high water channels, and lowering into the river structures that disrupt water flow.

The program allows land lying along rivers to act as natural water sponges in the event of a flood.

Since it was developed, the Dutch have taken the Room for the River program to other countries, including the Philippines.",2018-05-14 07:00:00+00:00,"['water', 'program', 'future', 'dutch', 'river', 'netherlands', 'rivers', 'number', 'canada', 'flood', 'ark', 'build', 'expected', 'flooding']",Canada,news article,English
154,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka needs $1.5 bln to tackle impending drought crisis - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170129/business-times/sri-lanka-needs-1-5-bln-to-tackle-impending-drought-crisis-226216.html,"Sri Lanka needs $1.5 bln to tackle impending drought crisis By Quintus Perera View(s): View(s):

If the drought continues as predicted, it would be disastrous on the economy with water for agriculture available only till March, creating problems of a scarcity of water, electricity and food shortages.

These alarm bells were sounded by Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, State Minister of Finance when he addressed the launch of Construction Expo 2017 organised by the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) held last week in Colombo.

The exhibition will be held from June 2 to 4 at the BMICH.

Mr. Abeywardena said that it is estimated that the Government would need around US$1.5 billion to meet the contingencies attributed to this impending climatic disaster with international organisations like the UN pledging around US$500 million, which is still short of the need.

In this situation, Government would have no option other than pull out the funds allocated for other activities. He said that the scarcity of water and electricity would also affect the construction industry.

Speaking of the construction industry, he asserted that the construction industry in Asia is heavily expanding and moving forward. Sri Lanka too is striving to keep pace with that trend, while the industry is adopting new environmental and safety trends. Specially, he said there was a big change in the construction industry in Sri Lanka after the war.

He pointed out that in 2014 the construction industry contributed 7.2 per cent to the GDP but it has declined to 6.4 per cent in 2015 due to the elections which is normal. However he pointed out that the industry has gathered momentum and during the first three quarters of 2016 it has increased to 6.9 per cent. The target for 2017, he indicated is 12 per cent.

Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, Chairman, CIOB said that they are working towards a ‘Green Sri Lanka’ – Green Concept in the construction industry.

The association is conducting ‘Construction Expo’ for the fifth consecutive year. He said that it gathers momentum year after year making it the country’s premier building construction exhibition on machinery, technology supply and services. He said more and more companies are interested in obtaining the ‘Green Marketing Concept’ for recognition of their products and services.

This move, he pointed out is to take the construction industry in Sri Lanka to be in par with the most advanced countries in technology and other aspects with sustainable construction methodology with the intention of providing all the knowhow. He said that adapting to the ‘Green Concept’ would save up to 40 per cent of the expenditure as it reuses the waste resources.",2017-01-29 08:00:00+00:00,"['concept', 'pointed', 'lanka', 'impending', 'sri', 'bln', 'construction', 'drought', 'cent', 'water', 'tackle', 'industry', 'crisis', '15', 'green', 'technology', 'needs']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
732,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Kenya has lost nearly half its forests – time for the young to act - The Africa Report,https://www.theafricareport.com/16150/kenya-has-lost-nearly-half-its-forests-time-for-the-young-to-act/,"The projected impacts of climate change, deforestation and land degradation could lead to the extinction of species and intensify the frequency and impacts of droughts and floods, with far-reaching consequences on communities, ecosystems, food security and infrastructure.

As the world begins to wake up to this crisis, there is a lot of talk about solutions. It is good to see more people talking about the need for urgent action.

But far too many, including those in Africa, overlook two essential ingredients: nature and youth. This duo cannot be ignored in the search for solutions to our planetary crises.

In my home country of Kenya, there is simply no way we can achieve our national target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 without addressing deforestation and land degradation—which remain the largest source of emissions here.

Deforestation has long been a problem. When Kenya gained independence in 1963, 10% of the country was covered in forest. By 2009, this number had dropped to 6% as a result of charcoal and timber production, agriculture expansion, unregulated logging and urbanisation. Not only has this increased our contribution to climate change, it has had a number of other devastating impacts, including soil erosion, increased flooding and dramatically reduced availability of fresh water during droughts.

Water towers under threat

Kenya’s five montane forests — called “water towers” because of their ability to store water during the rainy season and release it slowly during dry periods — provide 75% of our fresh water supplies.

The United Nations Environment Programme estimated that between 2000 and 2010 more than 28,000 hectares of forest was lost from these water towers, “leading to reduced water availability of approximately 62 million cubic metres per year”. The resulting costs to our economy far exceeded the financial gains from forestry and logging during that same period by a ratio of four to one.

Nearly a decade ago, the government at the time began to wake up to the problem and made a constitutional commitment to replenish the country’s forests back to 10% of surface area by 2030, which is equivalent to more than 1.6 million hectares of reforestation. Sadly, though, initial efforts were hampered by illegal logging, land disputes, and political infighting.

The good news is there are signs of progress, including new government-led initiatives. For example, the government has moved forward its deadline for the 10% target to 2022 and has created an enabling a legal framework to achieve it. On top of that, it has committed to restoring 5.1 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes by 2030 as its contribution to the African Forest and Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), a pan-African, country-led effort to restore 100 million hectares of deforested and degraded landscapes.

But the simple fact is that we are not making nearly enough concrete progress given the massive scale and urgency of the threat. Yes, the challenges Kenya is facing on this front are very real. For example, the government has estimated the total cost of implementing the 2022 target to be around $430 million over four years, requiring a mix of public and private financing that has not yet emerged. And access to a sustainable supply of high-quality tree seedlings is also proving problematic seeing as the effort is estimated to require 1.8 billion of them.

But there is no time for excuses; we need to dramatically pick up the pace of our efforts. While there is no single solution, one way to take immediate action is by mobilising our young people to become champions for nature. This certainly isn’t a new idea and there have been youth climate groups in Kenya and the region doing great work for a number of years.

However, 2019 has seen the rise of a global youth movement for climate action on a scale never seen before; and this movement has spread to Africa, which has the youngest population in the world. The scale, energy and momentum of this movement creates new opportunities that simply didn’t exist before.

This growing movement of young people are passionate about their futures, motivated and eager to learn. We have the energy and the drive to take action. But, in most cases, we don’t have the information or the know how. That’s why any serious effort to harness the power of this youth movement and transform it into a force for change must begin with education, both as part of formal school curriculums, as well as through initiatives like Youth4Nature. In order for youth to be stewards of nature-based solutions in climate action, we need spaces and resources to strengthen our understanding of what they are and how youth can get involved.

For example, we need to scale up projects like Green Treasures Farms, a Kenyan youth initiative that teaches women and young people in rural Kenya organic farming skills and how and where to plant trees. The project has been running for five years and has had a real impact on local communities by teaching them how environmental concerns and sustainable agriculture go hand-in-hand.

Broadly speaking, there are a number of ways that young people can help make a real impact. On the one hand, we can use our power as advocates within our families, schools, and communities to educate and empower others. And on the other, we can hold our political leaders to account. We must ensure that our leaders continue to push for more action to protect and restore nature. The global climate strike being planned for September 20 offers a good opportunity to send a clear signal of our intent to political leaders.

Time is running out.

We can’t afford to turn our backs on any solution to the climate crisis. And this isn’t just about what we can do in Kenya, or in Africa for that matter.

Nature-based solutions have the capacity to provide roughly 30% of the solution to climate change around the globe. But to achieve this potential, the global community has to step-up support for nature-based solutions. And this includes giving young people the education, support and resources they need to lead initiatives that protect nature and help communities develop and prosper in a sustainable manner.",2019-08-12 07:00:00+00:00,"['need', 'act', 'water', 'forests', 'solutions', 'lost', 'climate', 'young', 'nearly', 'million', 'kenya', 'movement', 'africa', 'youth', 'half']",Ghana,news article,English
194,Drought Sri Lanka,Kashmir farmers caught in border crossfire hit hard by drought - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/03/kashmir-farmers-border-crossfire-hit-hard-drought,"The past three decades have not been kind to the residents of Keerni in the foothills of the Himalayas. The village in India’s Poonch district, in Jammu and Kashmir state, sits on the disputed line of control between India and Pakistan, and people and cattle have often been maimed or killed in crossfire or by landmines.

Residents of Keerni’s 750 mud-built homes have also had to deal with intensifying border conflict following India’s strikes against purported terrorist camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in September.

Now Keerni’s inhabitants must grapple not only with heightened security threats but also a state-wide drought that is hitting them especially hard. Jammu and Kashmir is reeling under the longest dry spell in a decade, say experts. Winter crops that would usually be sown by October or November cannot be cultivated this season in many areas of the state reliant on rainfall.

Sonam Lotus, director of Jammu and Kashmir’s meteorology department, told local press in early December that the state had been dealing with a dry spell since 2007 and that it was unlikely to break any time soon. Isolated border villages such as Keerni – which lacks road connections, piped water, a school or a hospital – are among those worst affected by the drought.

“Since our area has not received any rains until now, our farms remain unploughed. We’ll have to purchase food and fodder in the days to come,” says farmer Mohammad Fakir.

Two factors are making it increasingly difficult to stay in the village, he explains. “Farming is our only source of livelihood, and rains have become highly unpredictable. Second, the frequent ceasefire violations keep disrupting routine life, and no one feels safe here. In the wake of ongoing skirmishes, we couldn’t harvest crops in time. Due to the delay, wild animals damaged a lot of our standing crop.”

Fakir says he harvested 250kg of maize and 30kg of pulses from his half-hectare (1.25 acre) plot last season – a third of what he had anticipated.

In the past, water shortages were not an issue, he says. “About three decades ago, the village would get two to three feet of snow every winter, and there used to be no drinking water scarcity all through the year. But the snowfall has reduced drastically over the past few years. Now the village only gets a few inches of snow annually.”

With no electric-powered flour mill in the village, the single water-powered mill has been struggling to meet demand as the flow of the stream declines. Villagers fear the mill may shut down due to a lack of rain, long before the stocks of grain to be milled are exhausted.

Fakir says the security situation makes things even more complicated. “In the wake of border cross-firing, [the] few remaining water bodies also become inaccessible to us and our cattle.”Locals are accustomed to threats from ongoing border strife between India and Pakistan. In 2001, all of Keerni’s residents were evacuated for security reasons. When they were finally allowed to return to their rundown dwellings 10 years later, the village was virtually cut off from the rest of India by a huge fence on one side, and landmines marking the line of control on the other.

Keerni’s residents say they must cross this border fence – only open during specified hours – to get access to basic facilities such as healthcare and education.

Fortifying the area used up a large chunk of farmland and restricted access to resources such as water, residents say. What agricultural land remained had also degraded after being left uncultivated for almost 10 years.

Nazam Deen Mir, a local teacher with a monthly salary of 3,000 rupees (£36), says that because of the drought the government should act quickly to provide villagers with jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, a rural job scheme. Otherwise, he says, “a majority of our men will have to leave their homes in search of alternative livelihood opportunities”.

Citing drought affecting many parts of the country, Prime Minister Modi said in April last year that a “massive effort” would be launched under the rural employment scheme to improve water conservation and storage.

Some villagers have already left Keerni with their families to work as labourers in the state’s winter capital, Jammu. Others sound increasingly devoid of hope about the future.

“A farmer in our border village knows exactly what to do in the face of exploding shells and bullets whizzing by,” says Khaleel Ahmed Mir, 22. “One can somehow cope with the loss of life, limbs and livestock. But one really doesn’t have any idea how to deal with this [drought] situation.”",2017-02-03 08:00:00+00:00,"['farmers', 'india', 'residents', 'village', 'jammu', 'water', 'caught', 'winter', 'villagers', 'drought', 'hit', 'kashmir', 'border', 'hard', 'crossfire']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

1487,FL-2019-000179-CAN,Back road to hope: Migrants flood Canada at remote NY outpost - BurlingtonFreePress.com,https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2017/08/09/back-road-hope-migrants-flood-canada-remote-ny-outpost/553716001/,"WILSON RING

Associated Press

CHAMPLAIN, N.Y. - They have come from all over the United States, piling out of taxis, pushing strollers and pulling luggage, to the end of a country road in the north woods.

Where the pavement stops, they pick up small children and lead older ones wearing Mickey Mouse backpacks around a ""road closed"" sign, threading bushes, crossing a ditch, and filing past another sign in French and English that says ""No pedestrians."" Then they are arrested.

Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, migrants who came to the U.S. from across the globe — Syria, Congo, Haiti, elsewhere — arrive here where Roxham Road dead-ends so they can walk into Canada, hoping its policies will give them the security they believe the political climate in the United States does not.

""In Trump's country, they want to put us back to our country,"" said Lena Gunja, a 10-year-old from Congo, who until this week had been living in Portland, Maine. She was traveling with her mother, father and younger sister. ""So we don't want that to happen to us, so we want a good life for us. My mother, she wants a good life for us.""

The passage — just across Lake Champlain and a little north of Burlington, Vermont — has become so crowded this summer that Canadian police set up a reception center on their side of the border. The center is in the Quebec community of Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, about 30 miles south of Montreal, or almost 300 miles north of New York City.

It includes tents that have popped up in the past few weeks, where migrants are processed before they are turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency, which handles their applications for refuge.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are adding electricity and portable toilets. A Canadian flag stands just inside the first tent, where the Mounties search the immigrants they've just arrested and check their travel documents. They are also offered food. Then shuttle buses take the processed migrants to their next destination. Trucks carry their luggage separately.

The Canadian military said Wednesday that about 100 soldiers began arriving to prepare a site for tents to accommodate almost 500 people. The soldiers will also install lighting and heating equipment.

How this spot, not even an official border crossing, became the favored place to cross into Canada is anyone's guess. But once migrants started going there, word spread on social media.

Under the 2002 Safe Country Agreement between the United States and Canada, migrants seeking asylum must apply to the first country they arrive in. If they were to go to a legal port of entry, they would be returned to the United States and told to apply there.

But, in a quirk in the application of the law, if migrants arrive in Canada at a location other than a port of entry, such as Roxham Road, they are allowed to request refugee status there.

Many take buses to Plattsburgh, New York, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south. Some fly there, and others take Amtrak. Sometimes taxis carry people right up to the border. Others are let off up the road and have to walk, pulling their luggage behind them.

Used bus tickets litter the pavement, their points of origin mostly blurred by rain that fell on nights previous. One read ""Jacksonville.""

One Syrian family said they flew into New York City on tourist visas and then went to Plattsburgh, where they took a taxi to the border.

The migrants say they are driven by the perception that the age of Republican President Donald Trump, with his ban on travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries, means the United States is no longer the destination of the world's dispossessed. Taking its place in their minds is the Canada of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a member of his country's Liberal Party.

Most of the people making the crossing now are originally from Haiti. The Trump administration said this year it planned to end in January a special humanitarian program enacted after the 2010 earthquake that gave about 58,000 Haitians permission to stay temporarily in the U.S.

Walking toward the border in a group on Monday, Medyne Milord, 47, originally of Haiti, said she needs work to support her family.

""If I return to Haiti, the problem will double,"" she said. ""What I hope is to have a better life in Canada.""

Jean Rigaud Liberal, 38, said he had been in the United States for seven months and lived in Florida after he left Haiti. He learned about Roxham Road from Facebook and said he thinks ""Canada will be better than America.""

""We are not comfortable in America,"" said Liberal. ""We are seeking a better life; we don't want to go back to Haiti.""

On the New York side, U.S. Border Patrol agents sometimes check to be sure the migrants are in the United States legally, but they said they don't have the resources to do it all the time.

Besides, said Brad Brant, a special operations supervisor for the U.S. Border Patrol, ""our mission isn't to prevent people from leaving.""

Small numbers continue to cross into Canada elsewhere, but the vast majority take Roxham Road. U.S. officials said they began to notice last fall, around the time of the U.S. presidential election, that more people were crossing there.

Francine Dupuis, the head of a Quebec government-funded program that helps asylum seekers, said her organization estimates 1,174 people overall crossed into Quebec last month, compared with 180 in July 2016. U.S. and Canadian officials estimated that on Sunday alone, about 400 people crossed the border at Roxham Road.

""All they have to do is cross the border,"" Dupuis said. ""We can't control it. They come in by the hundreds, and it seems to be increasing every day.""

Canada said last week it planned to house some migrants in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. It could hold thousands, but current plans call for only 450.

In most cases, once the migrants are in Canada they are released and can live freely while their claims for refugee status are processed, which can take years. Meanwhile, they are eligible for public assistance.

Brenda Shanahan, the Liberal Party member of Parliament who represents the area, visited the site Monday. She is proud of her country for being willing to take in the dispossessed, she said, but there is no guarantee they will be able to stay in Canada.

""It's not a free ticket for refugee status, not at all,"" Shanahan said.

Opposition Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel said the Trudeau government lacks a plan to deal with the illegal crossings, even though a summer spike had been anticipated.

""All that we have heard is that we are monitoring the situation,"" she said. ""The government needs to come up with a plan right away to deal with this.""

It will further backlog a system in which some refugees are already waiting 11 years for hearings, Rempel said. Canadians will question the integrity of the immigration system if the ""dangerous trend"" of illegal crossings continues, she said.

Trudeau himself recently said his country has border checkpoints and controls that need to be respected.

""We have an open compassionate country, but we have a strong system that we follow,"" he said. ""Protecting Canadian confidence in the integrity of our system allows us to continue to be open, and that's exactly what we need to continue to do.""

Inancieu Merilien, originally of Haiti, moved to the United States in 2000 but crossed into Canada late last month. U.S. authorities, he said, are trying to scare Haitians by refusing to guarantee they'll be able to stay.

""There's a big difference here. They welcomed us very well,"" he said after leaving the Olympic Stadium to begin looking for a home in Montreal's large Haitian community. ""They're going to give us housing in apartments. I hope everything goes well.""

1646,FL-2020-000164-IND,Criticism of new signs at Chilbolton Cow Common - Andover Advertiser,https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/news/18557183.criticism-new-signs-chilbolton-cow-common/,"A PARISH council has defended the installation of “hostile” signage at a beauty spot near Andover, which has made the area look like “some East German park”, in the words of one resident.

Chilbolton Cow Common has seen more than a dozen signs put up in recent weeks, warning visitors not to enter or park in certain areas, to observe social distancing, to treat the area with respect and not to “urinate or defecate on our common”.

The village’s parish council, which installed the signs, says the temporary signage is necessary due to “anti-social and inappropriate behaviours on the Common” which have seen police visit the site on “numerous occasions” in recent months.

But the measures have drawn criticism from some visitors.

One resident said the scene was “one of the most shocking things” he had ever seen, and reminiscent of an “East German park”. Another described the new signs as “hostile” and “a visual eye-sore” in a letter to the Advertiser and hit out at the parish council for installing them in the first place.

The council, however, says that action was necessary amid record numbers of visitors to the site.

A statement from Chilbolton parish council read: “Under normal circumstances I would agree that signage on the Common should be kept to a minimum.

“However, like many other beauty spots up and down the country, we have been trying to manage the Common in quite exceptional circumstances with record high numbers of people visiting the site. This has prompted a number of concerns being raised by local residents.”

Those concerns include parking issues, said to be a “hot topic” for a number of years, plus an “increase in complaints about anti-social and inappropriate behaviours on the Common such as the use of BBQs, using parts of the Common as a ‘open-air toilet’ and dis-regarding social distancing measures.”

The authority also says the temporary signage has, so far, been working.

Its statement continued: “The permanent signage that we have has proven to be nowhere near sufficient to manage the large numbers visiting the site and as a temporary measure we agreed to put high profile visible notices to ensure that people visiting the site know what behaviours are expected of them. Since erecting the signage and making changes to the area where cars park we have seen significant improvements. By and large the vast majority of visitors have understood the need for the signage and behaved responsibly.

“As a Parish Council we would like to hold a Public Meeting (when it is safe to do so) to discuss all of these issues and get the broader views of our local residents. We do not propose to do this until the Autumn at the earliest which will give us chance to reflect on all of the options and implications.”",2020-07-02 07:00:00+00:00,"['chilbolton', 'visitors', 'council', 'parish', 'signs', 'site', 'seen', 'criticism', 'cow', 'common', 'signage', 'visiting', 'temporary', 'park']",India,news article,English

With support from other partners, the Ghana chapter of Plan International (Plan International Ghana), a child and gender-based charity, has been running a five-year program to promote school enrollment in poor and deprived communities, its Country Director Solomon Tesfamariam said.

The Reaching and Teaching Out of School Children is a five-year program spanning from 2015 to 2020, aiming to enroll 90,000 out-of-school children from five regions.

The project advocates that partners at the national and district levels urgently address a lack of schools in communities where there were none.

Available data indicate that Ghana’s school enrollment rate stood at 84 percent by 2013.

“The project will enroll boys and girls in the beneficiary regions through the Complementary Basic Education, and transition 70 percent of the graduates to formal primary schools,” Tesfamariam said at the One Day West African Corporate Social Responsibility Conference.

544,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Security Council Press Statement on Situation in Somalia (23 April 2021) - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/security-council-press-statement-situation-somalia-23-april-2021,"The following Security Council press statement was issued today by Council President Dinh Quy Dang (Viet Nam):

The members of the Security Council expressed their deep concern about the continued political impasse and disagreement among Somalia’s political leaders on the model for elections.

The members of the Security Council recalled the significant progress made during the past decade in Somalia, including in terms of security provision, democracy, political reforms and economic development, in particular debt relief. They commended the Somali people, the Somali authorities, the African Union, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its troop‑contributing countries, the United Nations and Somalia’s other international partners for their role in this endeavour.

The members of the Security Council emphasized that ongoing disagreement over the electoral model is not only undoing this hard-earned progress, but is also diverting attention from pressing problems, such as floods, drought, desert locusts, the COVID-19 pandemic and combating the terrorist threat of Al-Shabaab. They stressed that reaching consensus on elections would support and facilitate the continued development and progress of Somalia and its people.

The members of the Security Council underscored that consensus would be vital for any electoral model to be successfully delivered. They noted the 17 September 2020 agreement has remained the only basis so far endorsed by the Federal Government of Somalia and all Federal Member States.

The members of the Security Council therefore called on all parties to reject violence and resume dialogue as a matter of urgency and without precondition. They called on Somalia’s leaders to recognize and build upon the many areas of agreement already reached, to resolve their remaining differences and to put the interests of the people of Somalia first, within a Somali-owned, Somali-led electoral process, and with an agreed timetable, as soon as possible. They reiterated that, through the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) and in conjunction with AMISOM, the African Union, European Union, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and international partners, they stand ready to assist.

The members of the Security Council took note of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmaajo’s talks with the Democratic Republic of the Congo President and Chairperson of the African Union, Félix Tshisekedi, in Kinshasa on 19 April. They expressed their support for and encouraged regionally led international efforts to help bring the parties back to the table and facilitate inclusive negotiations.

The members of the Security Council took note of the IGAD statement of 21 April and the African Union Peace and Security Council communiqué of 22 April. They expressed their support for the Special Representative of the Secretary‑General, James Swan, and for African Union and IGAD efforts to help resolve the current impasse.

The members of the Security Council condemned all terrorist attacks in Somalia and the region and reaffirmed their respect for the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Somalia.

202,Drought Sri Lanka,"With No Water and Many Loans, Farmers' Deaths Are Rising in Tamil Nadu - The Wire",https://thewire.in/agriculture/drought-tamil-nadu-farmers-deaths,"From the banks of the Kollidam river, S. Selvaraju’s farm is barely a mile away.

The huge river, actually a tributary of the Cauvery that drains its surplus water into the sea, runs along the village of Anaikudy, 40 km from Thanjavur in the heart of Tamil Nadu’s Cauvery delta.

For centuries, people here have cultivated three crops every year – paddy, millets, then paddy again. Over the last few years, though, several farmers have switched to cultivating sugarcane for a state-run sugar mill nearby. Some have raised banana plantations too. New cash crops partially replaced the old paddy system.

Water – even if the rains weren’t good that year – never seemed to be a problem. Until suddenly it was.

Selvaraju took his own life, hanging himself from a tree on his farm, after his old borewell ran dry after serving him for two decades. The new one that he commissioned just a month earlier also bore no water.

The 65-year-old, who owned a seven-acre farm, committed suicide on May 5, leaving behind unpaid debts and a family – a wife and three sons – with many questions. Could he not have waited for a few more months for the rains? What was the need to kill himself?

Water, says Selvaraju’s son Karti, has suddenly become a luxury in and around the village.

As his family struggles to come to terms with his father’s suicide, Karti says, “I had heard of farmers committing suicides in different parts of the country, but never thought this will happen to us.”

In Kadamankudy village of Nagapattinam district, at the far-eastern tip of the Cauvery delta, a similar story unfolds.

He wasn’t the right age to suffer a heart attack. Veermani was 35 when he passed away on December 30, 2016.

“We were on the field; he just collapsed and died,” his widow Kavitha tells us at her small thatched hut, wondering how her husband could die at such a young age. He was fit and fine, she says, but under a lot of stress. Nothing was left on the farm – it wore a forlorn look, she says. The couple went to their farm – a 1.25-acre plot that this landless Dalit family leased for the first time from a fellow villager – to tend to the crop, or whatever was left of it. Around 4 pm, from some distance, she saw him falling.

“When I rushed to check what the matter was, he was not responding,” she says. She called for help and took him to the nearby cottage hospital in an ambulance. He was no more, the doctors told her.

It was, doctors told Kavitha, a shock death – something she hasn’t been able to fathom even today.

“It did not rain this year; it was our bad luck,” she says. “It was the first year we decided to lease land and it turned out to be the worst year for farming.”

A sudden spike in rural deaths

There is no comprehensive data on farmer deaths in Tamil Nadu in the 2016-17 farming season, but newspaper reports and independent inquiries by groups like the People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) and the Tamil Nadu Federation of Women Farmers Rights suggest that over 200 farmers died of heart attacks or committed suicide in December 2016 and January 2017. The sudden spike in death rates comes mainly from the delta region and sparked protests across the state, with some groups holding dramatic protests in Delhi. As many as 106 farmers were reported to have committed suicide in December, according to a notice issued by the National Human Rights Commission to the state government on January 5, 2017.

Veermani was not the only tenant farmer to have died of shock.

About 25 km from Kavitha’s village is Adhichapooram, in Thiruvarur district. There, Arokyamary narrates a similar tale. No one in the family thought that T. Azhagesan, her husband, would die of a heart attack. He was only 36 years old. On November 4, his widow says, he went to his farm in the afternoon and died of a sudden shock in the middle of his wilting crops. Azhagesan, a landless Scheduled Tribe farmer, had also leased two acres of farmland.

His sudden demise has thrown his family into a financial and emotional quagmire. Azhagesan’s elderly mother, Amruthavalli, is now the only working member of the family – she works as a sweeper in a nearby school for Rs 3,000 a month.

These shock deaths are a consequence of emotional stress and economic troubles, says Dr Bharati Selvan, a practicing cardiologist and social worker in Mannargudi town of Thiruvarur district, once a prosperous paddy bowl in the Delta region. Selvan was part of a fact-finding team comprising farmers, social activists, students, doctors and concerned citizens who enquired into the reasons for deaths in the region.

“That was in early January; we split into three teams and studied some 50 cases of sudden shock deaths and suicides in addition to the prevailing situation in three districts of the delta – Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur and Thanjavur,” Selvan says. “The crisis is worsening and the government’s apathy is telling.”

The Delta has never seen farm suicides or shock deaths before. Most of those who have died had no history of cardiac ailments; several of them were very young.

“Though the government does not accept it, we have reasons to believe that a sudden emotional stress and economic turmoil could have caused these deaths,” he says.

A shock for Tamil Nadu

This is not like the dry and barren Marathwada or Bundelkhand or deserts of western Rajasthan – this is the highly productive Cauvery delta, a region that epitomises one of the oldest civilisations in the world, where the farmers until very recently grew three crops every year to meet local needs and send the surplus to feed the deficit in other regions. This is also not Vidarbha, where cotton farmers’ suicides aren’t abating. This is South India’s paddy bowl – the land of prosperity.

When the monsoon failed, farmers this reporter spoke to in village after village in the delta region talked about failed crops, mounting debts and the lack of work. There are four months to go before the monsoon arrives in October.

Selvaraju had about Rs 7 lakh in unpaid debts – crop loans from banks and loans from the informal sources that he borrowed to meet domestic exigencies.

He spent at least Rs 5 lakh on two surgeries that his wife Rasati underwent for the removal of a brain tumour over the last two years. This meant recurring heath expenses. Karti says the last two years drained the family financially.

Added to this were his falling assets. He sold a pair of his bullocks last year. All the family’s gold has been pawned to a jeweller in Thanjavur, Karti says. Bank savings are gone. The only possession they have now is the home he built.

Selvaraju’s situation is symbolic of the average Anaikudy farmer. The drought has begun to bite.

Tamil Nadu is not known for farmers’ suicides. The 2015 report on accidental deaths and suicides in India from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) says that while Maharashtra (3,030), Telangana (1,358), Karnataka (1,197), Andhra (516), Madhya Pradesh (581) and Chhattisgarh (854) were the top states in terms of farmers’ suicides, Tamil Nadu that year counted only two farmers suicides, a fact contested by activists on the ground. The state however recorded 604 farm labourers’ suicides the same year, the NCRB data shows, while 1,261 farm labourers in Maharashtra and 709 in Madhya Pradesh took their own lives. A closer analysis shows these may actually be suicides by tenant farmers.

The PUCL inquiry says most of these deaths are the fallout of crop losses and mounting debts. The Tamil Nadu government says these deaths have no correlation with the prevailing agrarian distress – even though 21 of 32 districts in the state have been declared drought affected and there’s no other reason for a sudden wave of shock deaths in such a short period of time.

A crisis that’s not going away

The delta is in crisis – and it’s not going away soon, says S. Ranganathan, the octogenarian farmer leader from Mannargudi town in Thiruvarur who first moved a petition before the Supreme Court three decades ago pleading for a settlement of the dispute with Karnataka on Cauvery water sharing. “This is the worst year in my memory – a three-crop region not able to plant crops for even one season.”

The usual northeast or receding monsoon, which sweeps across Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, south Karnataka and Kerala between October and December, failed in 2016-17. The state registered an overall deficit of 60% in the south-west and northeast monsoon.

Tamil Nadu reported a drop in the winter sowing of rice by well over 30% and production by more than 60%, according to the estimates. About 35 lakh hectares of land suffered from drought in the state, according to the Integrated Drought Severity Index that is developed by the International Water Management Institute, Sri Lanka.

The delta, until two decades ago, was a three-crop region – mostly irrigated by its fantastic network of surface water canals branching out of the Cauvery and her umpteen tributaries. In 20 years, water shortage brought the region down to two crops and pushed the borewell frenzy.

By the state government’s estimates, including data on subsidised power pumps, the delta today has close to two million borewells, sinking deeper and deeper to reach groundwater.

The year gone by was the first time in a century that the delta farmers could not handle even one crop, due to failed monsoons and the non-release of Tamil Nadu’s share of Cauvery waters by Karnataka owing to a drought in the upper catchment areas and a gradient drop in the groundwater table, says Ranganathan, who heads the Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association. As one travels across the region in the simmering heat, the signs of distress are obvious. Work is hard to come by and migration has increased.

Karti finished his mechanical engineering from a private college in Coimbatore – he is able to speak broken English and went to Singapore very recently to work for a private company as a maintenance engineer. “I could not find any job here, so when this opportunity came I took it up.”

The last five years, Selvaraju spent a lot of money on Karti’s engineering education. “My two brothers did not study much, so he would nudge me to study,” he says.

The eldest son Kavaskar, 35, is married and has taken to farming; the youngest Illayaraja, 19, is a school dropout and works for daily wages when he’s not helping on the farm.

Karti says he earns a salary of Rs 20,000 in Singapore – which is just about sufficient to pay his bills in that country. He lives with ten other employees in a room.

Last year, Selvaraju had to support Karti with a couple of lakh rupees to get a job and fly to Singapore. Where did the money come from? “He borrowed,” the son says nervously, his voice choking.

From paddy, which needs a lot of water but does not give huge returns, Selvaraju switched to sugarcane in 2012, since a lot of other farmers with irrigation facilities were shifting to that crop, Karti says. The problem that they didn’t see coming, though, stemmed from mismanagement at the sugar mill.

The sugar mill, run by the Tamil Nadu Sugar Corporation, has been facing financial problems, which led to delays and non-payment of cane dues to many farmers.

For two successive years, Selvaraju sold his sugarcane to the mill but got no money against it. The total money due to be paid to him by the mill is around Rs 8 lakh – non-payment to cane growers is now a big political issue in this part. It was their money and yet they could not access it, his son laments. “He would go with other farmers regularly to the mill to enquire about their payments and would return disillusioned,” Karti says.

No respite in groundwater

This year, when the rains failed, Selvaraju dived into his groundwater resources. Kollidam was dry as a desert; this was the first time in many years that it did not see water released from the upstream for even a day, Anaikudy villagers say.

Apparently the groundwater table too receded by several metres in this part and has now been labeled “critical” by the state’s groundwater development agency. There’s a reason for that.

For years, the staggered release of water from the upstream Karnataka into the Cauvery has badly affected the delta, the tail end of the basin. It has affected the drinking water supplies of the towns and severely hit the canal irrigation network.

Usually, the groundwater would be recharged automatically in this part as the Kollidam waters brought the Cauvery surplus and the north-east monsoon brought a good amount of rains.

But now that cycle was broken. When Selvaraju tried to access groundwater and his old borewell ran dry, he decided to gamble on a new one, like many others did.

The new one, his son says, didn’t yield any water even at 400 feet, forcing him to call off the digging. The reason is obvious: the state’s public works department has dug deep borewells right in the middle of rivers all over the delta, including the Kollidam, to siphon out water from beneath the riverbed and supply it to the big towns and cities, including Thanjavur. The villages are left dry.

Today’s Selvaraju’s farm has standing sugarcane crop on half his land. Given the lack of water, it’s not doing well. The rains are still four months away.

“My father sounded anxious and tired when I last spoke to him, just a day before his death,” Karti says.

Selvaraju would not be convinced, his son says, that things will be alright. “He kept telling me that the borewell on our farm had no water and that it was not a good sign that the river had fallen silent.”

Standing in his garden in Kabul, Baz Mohammad Kochi oversees the drilling of a new well more than 100 metres deep after his first water reservoir dried up. He is not alone.

A shortage of rain and snow, a booming population and wasteful consumption have drained the Afghan capital's water basin and sparked a race to the bottom as households and businesses bore deeper and deeper wells in search of the precious resource.

""The water level has dropped so much that it is now necessary to reach other underground basins 100 metres, even 120 metres"" deep, says well digger Mohammad Aman as his dilapidated machine pierces the ochre earth in Kochi's yard.

Every year 80 million cubic metres (2.8 billion cubic feet) of water are extracted from Kabul's aquifers—nearly double the natural recharge rate through precipitation, according to utility Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation.

As a result Kabul's water table has fallen at least 30 metres (100 feet) in recent years, says Asian Development Bank deputy country director Shanny Campbell.

Snow has fallen in the city this month but it is not nearly enough to solve the water shortage—in some areas the level has dropped 20 metres in the past year.

""The problem we have in Kabul is the massive increase in population, impact of climate change and overall less precipitation and snowfall,"" Campbell explains.

Only around 20 percent of Kabul is connected to the city's piped water system, leaving many residents to ensure their own supply by digging wells that are often shared by several neighbours.

Others buy water from private companies, or, like Mohammad Nazir, fill up jerry cans at mosques or more than 400 public taps scattered around the city.

Every year 80 million cubic metres (2.8 billion cubic feet) of water are extracted from Kabul's aquifers—nearly double the natural recharge rate through precipitation, according to utility Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation

""There is no point turning on the taps—there is no water here,"" says Nazir, 50, who lives on a hill where the ground is too hard to dig a well and the city's pipes do not reach.

""It's the worst year we've ever lived.""

Undrinkable

Water is not only scarce in Kabul, but most of it is undrinkable, according to the National Environmental Protection Agency.

Around 70 percent of the city's groundwater is contaminated by waste and chemicals from leaky household septic tanks and industrial plants that can cause diarrhoea or other illnesses if the water is not boiled or purified properly.

Efforts to increase connections to the municipal piped water network and improve sanitation systems are under way.

But progress is slow as authorities struggle to keep up with demand in one of the fastest growing cities in the world.

Kabul's population has more than doubled to around five million in the past 30 years, boosted by the arrival of people fleeing war and poverty.

It is expected to reach eight million by 2050, according to a report published in the Washington-based SAIS Review of International Affairs in 2017.

Kabul's population is expected to reach eight million by 2050, according to a report published in the Washington-based SAIS Review of International Affairs in 2017

Improving living standards for many households also means more people are showering and washing cars than ever before.

A lack of public awareness about water conservation and no restrictions on its usage means much of it is wasted.

While they try to work out how to replenish the city's subterranean reserves, authorities are using a television campaign and the influence of religious leaders to encourage households to save water.

""In our Friday sermons, we call on the faithful not to waste water,"" said Abdul Raouf, a member of the Ulema Council, the country's highest religious body.

As they wait for the first winter snow in the city, worshippers also pray ""for this drought to end as soon as possible"".

Even the Taliban are on board, issuing a statement to followers to ""pray for rain"".

Quick fix

Authorities are not waiting for divine intervention to fix Kabul's water problem.

With droughts, like the one affecting swathes of Afghanistan this year, expected to increase in severity and frequency as a result of climate change, a long-term solution is needed.

Around 70 percent of Kabul's water is contaminated by waste and chemicals from leaky household septic tanks and industrial plants, according to the National Environmental Protection Agency

Among the options being explored by the ADB are ""spreading basins""—large ponds that trap rainwater long enough for it to seep into the soil and recharge aquifers.

The ADB is also looking at using ""pumps to inject the water directly into"" the basins and the construction of a dam on the outskirts of Kabul.

""The answer is not in one technology but in a mixture,"" Campbell said.

""Kabul is under a situation of water stress so we're looking for a solution with lower impact, lower cost technology that could fix the problem quickly.""

That would be welcome news to Kochi, who cannot hide his relief as water gushes out his new well. He knows the borehole could dry up again soon.

""We have survived revolution and civil wars, the Taliban regime and suicide attacks, but this water shortage may force us to leave,"" Kochi says.

""There is no life without water.""

By Jared Ferrie

May 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Millions of Afghans face hunger after a drought decimated crops in the war-ravaged country, U.N. officials said on Tuesday, calling for an extra $115 million to help families buy food.

Two thirds of Afghanistan's 34 provinces have been hit by a lack of rain or snowfall since late last year, said a bulletin from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Some rivers and water points have totally dried up, and the last wheat harvest has been ""completely lost"", according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.

""Six months down the road, millions of people could be in a situation of untenable hunger without knowing where their next meal will come from,"" said Toby Lanzer, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan.

Already, the drought has forced 21,000 people to leave their homes and settle on the outskirts of the western city of Herat, said OCHA.

The U.N. hopes to distribute cash to enable families to buy food and try to prevent further migration.

""People prefer cash, which allows them to buy what they need most,"" he said. ""We prefer not to truck food across the country, also because doing so is expensive and can disrupt markets.""

The U.N. is revising its humanitarian appeal for 2018 because of the drought, and says it needs an extra $115 million to help 1.4 million of the hardest-hit people.

Only one quarter of the $430 million the U.N. requested for 2018 was funded as of May 23.

The drought has also hurt nomadic herders known as Kuchis, as pasturelands have dried up in some areas, including the northeastern provinces of Badakhshan and Kunduz.

""The animals are too weak to walk to their usual pastures in Badakhshan province and herders have to rent trucks to bring them there,"" OCHA quoted Abdul Majidi, head of the Kunduz agricultural department, as saying.

Prices for sheep have fallen by as much as 40 percent, but many Kuchis are selling them out of desperation, according to OCHA's report.

The Afghan government and its allies are fighting an array of militant groups, including the Taliban and the Islamic State, which has exacerbated the effects of the drought in some provinces.

""In Helmand, village elders reportedly need to obtain special approval from the armed groups controlling their districts to access markets in areas under government control,"" said the bulletin.

The cost of wheat shot up by 50 percent and produce prices quadrupled in Kandahar City when roads were temporarily closed in April due to fighting, it said.

1044,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,Climate risk profile: Mozambique - Fact Sheet - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/climate-risk-profile-mozambique-fact-sheet,"COUNTRY OVERVIEW

Mozambique’s vulnerability to climate change is a function of its location and geography: large areas of the country are exposed to tropical cyclones, droughts (every three to four years) and river/coastal storm surge flooding. This vulnerability is heightened by the country’s 2,470 km of coastline and socioeconomic fragility. More than 60 percent of the population lives in low-lying coastal areas, where intense storms from the Indian Ocean and sea level rise put infrastructure, coastal agriculture, key ecosystems and fisheries at risk. Although migration to urban areas is rising, two-thirds of the population still resides in rural areas with limited access to electricity, improved drinking water and sanitation. Forty-five percent of the population lives below the poverty line and 70 percent depends on climate-sensitive agricultural production for their food and livelihoods. Increased frequency and severity of intense storms, droughts and floods are likely to exacerbate these development challenges. For example, El Niño conditions in 2015–2016 caused the worst drought in 35 years, reducing food availability by 15 percent. Food insecurity caused by the drought worsened in 2017 with Cyclone Dineo, which damaged crops and destroyed infrastructure.

A swimming pool crashed into a car park at a beachfront condominium in southeastern Brazil last week. The shocking incident which happened in Vila Velha, Espírito Santo, was captured on a security camera. The 75-foot long pool suddenly collapsed and turned it into a free car wash.

The CCTV footage shows the pool surrounded by plants and flood lights. No people are visible in the area. The bottom of the pool suddenly collapses in a clean break. The video then transitions to the parking garage below the pool, with is suddenly flooded with water. No people are seen in the garage.

Watch the video here:

The building's 270 residents were evacuated, Brazilian online news portal G1 reported. No injuries were reported in the incident. The accident did not damage vehicles in the indoor parking lot.

Some tenants of the building across the street from Itaparica Beach reported a strong gas odour coming from the heated swimming pool.

Argo, the company that built the 90-unit building, put up displaced tenants in nearby hotels for no cost.

Espírito Santo officials and Vila Velha cleared residents to return to their apartments on Tuesday after engineers inspected the complex and found no structural damage.

The pool was closed for at least three months in 2020 due to a leak, newspaper Folha Vitoria reported.

In October last year, an 18-year-old boy named Kunal Mohite saved the lives of 75 residents from a two-storey residential building collapse in Dombivli, Mumbai.

196,Drought Sri Lanka,How Bidar beat back the drought - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/how-bidar-beat-back-the-drought/article18282462.ece,"As Karnataka reels under drought, an academic is helping restore indigenous systems that were Bidar’s water lifeline 600 years ago. Lalitha Sridhar reports

The vast flatlands outlying Bidar face the brunt of the sun as it bears down on a thinly populated terrain marked by few trees and sparse foliage. But then a salubrious drop in temperature accompanies the rough descent down the six-metre-wide mouth of a medieval aqueduct to the north-west of the city. Here, about 25 feet below ground, is cool and softly flowing water, clear as crystal till bare feet touch the floor of the trough and raise a dense cloud of red sediment.

Medicinal ‘chamkora’ fern cluster around the white kaolin (calcium) deposits where the waterline meets the unleavened laterite. The play of water and light streaks the rock face in subtly rich mineral colours: black basalt, pinkish bauxite, umber iron, ochre clay. Harmless water bugs (Aquarius remigis) that help keep the water potable flutter in disarray. Fifteen metres into the tunnel, a 63-feet-high shaft opens to the sky and lets a swathe of light cast vague shadows on the inky darkness further ahead, where the water is deep enough to drown a man.

Harnessing old wisdom

Apertures in the towering walls indicate crevices from which, nearly 600 years ago, wicker lamps may have offered light to labouring workers. Five years ago, when V. Govindankutty, who was employed with, and represented, the Indian Heritage Cities Network Foundation in his work in Bidar from November 2011 to July 2013, and later became assistant professor of geography at Palakkad’s little known Government College of Chittur, first saw a trickle of water here, he did not realise that he had stumbled on an ancient engineering marvel — a series of an estimated 57 linearly placed vents connecting a cavernous and often winding 2.58-km-long subterranean tunnel, hewed to transport water from a perennial mother well at the start of a fault line (a linear geological fissure).

The water that now flows in the Naubad karez (aqueduct) is the result of months of challenging research and meticulous restoration, not only of the aqueduct and its vents but also of bawdis and kalyanis (open wells and tanks that dot the landscape here), a part of Bidar’s highly evolved and networked indigenous water systems.

Recently, the Karnataka government sought to declare drought in 26 of its 30 districts, 16 of which are to the north of the State and have received deficit rainfall, including Bidar, the northernmost. As a Cabinet sub-committee on drought assesses the situation, the restorers in the city of Bidar, also the district headquarters, expect water will last in the karez for another two-three months at current levels of usage, and it is early days yet for a project with life-saving implications. About 117 acres of farmland are irrigated by it and nearby neighbourhoods now turn to the karez for their water supply. The Naubad karez is the first of the very few known karez systems in India to be documented scientifically and restored.

Now running on plenty

A semi-arid Bidar receives 60-100 cm of rainfall annually. Its terrain is uniquely composed of ‘duricrust’ honeycomb-structured laterite (hard but porous and capable of absorbing rain water when forested with the right vegetation), below which lies the impermeable basalt of the Deccan trap that does not allow what is collected to percolate away.

Since that first excursion, Govindankutty has marked 814 bawdis and kalyanis along the three karez systems he has mapped around Bidar — the most accessible Naubad karez; the six-km-long Shukla Tirth, which begins at the old Gornalli kere (a lake-like waterbody) to provide water by terracotta pipes for the Agrahara village; and the poorly understood 1.33-km-long Jamna Mori, likely a water distribution system from the Bidar fort’s Fateh Darwaza to the moat of the royal enclosure, now buried under rampant urbanisation.

Following restoration efforts, after a brief spurt of heavy rains in September 2015, the Naubad karez was operational again for the first time in centuries — a monitoring team recorded water pouring out of its mouth at 120 litres per minute. Though it was dry again by the end of February 2016, the now-inspired restorers used the months that followed to continue with de-silting.

Nature handed them an unexpected turning point. Following the overall deficit rainfall since 2012, in the summer of 2016, for the first time in living memory, most of Bidar’s bawdis and kalyanis ran dry. “When this happened, people took the karez and bawdis seriously and it was easier to generate awareness about them. In a way, the crisis became an opportunity,” says Vinay Malge, 35, a civil contractor who co-founded Bidar YUVAA (Youth United for Vigilance, Awareness and Action) with friends in 2011.

Bidar YUVAA activists like Malge, Sabish Dande, Dileep Kumar and others carried forward Govindankutty’s work on the ground, egging on the local authorities to undertake the de-silting and cleaning of wells as part of MGNREGA projects; litigating against the encroachment of watershed land; protesting the proliferation of indiscriminately deeper tube wells that have caused the water table to drop drastically, adversely impacting the karez’s mathematical reliance on gradients; planting over one lakh indigenous trees so that rainwater wouldn’t run off before it could be absorbed; and creating awareness to prevent the dumping of garbage, and open defecation, along the karez.

Then, in September 2016, it rained copiously, and the Naubad karez, several irrigation reservoirs and many restored kalyanis have not run dry since.

A man and his mission

To date, Govindankutty has mapped 28 vents of the Naubad karez, which also serve as wells that harvest rainwater, although the numbers remain changeable as work on the karez’s restoration continues. In the beginning, he had little to go by besides the presence of fig and jamun trees and certain shrubs as indicators of water nearby. Often alone, the 43-year-old academic has climbed down four-storey-deep vents tied to a rope, taken several bruising falls down bramble and boulders, and had close encounters with a variety of fauna. Cobras, vipers, dragonflies, baya weavers, babblers, langurs and fruit-eating bats are a part of the biodiversity the karez supports, he says. He was, on one occasion, chased by a pack of dogs, and keeps his torch and camouflage cap handy at all times by way of defence.

As he made fortnightly trips from Palakkad to Bidar, taking off on weekends and holidays with modest personal funds, Govindankutty worked with Google Earth images, handheld GPS and GPS-aided mobile apps, survey devices like the dumpy level and prismatic compass, to record coordinates and create the Karez Geographic Information System, which he intends to make public once his research is completed. “The passion with which he has thrown himself into the painstaking and risky survey of the entire terrain is exemplary,” says K.K. Muhammed, retired regional director of the Archaeological Survey of India and now project director with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) in Hyderabad.

The Naubad karez or surang bhawi (‘tunnel wells’) is a complex system, Govindankutty discovered, which works inversely underground to leverage gravity — that is, the plateau’s natural gradient ascends from the mouth to the mother well but the tunnel underneath has been cut to descend from the mother well to the mouth. “Initially, even I was surprised,” Govindankutty says. “How did they do it?”

The professor, who will soon submit his PhD thesis on ‘Historic landscape conservation’ to the Kerala University, recalls inching forward on his stomach over some sections of the tunnel, relying only on his understanding of Bidar’s geology. “I knew the roof wouldn’t collapse, only the walls might slide,” he laughs, his energy for tromping terrain he now understands encyclopaedically quite boundless.

Today, as they continue to work their way underground from the mouth to the mother well, his efforts and that of local volunteers, now assisted by government funds, have rendered 16 vents accessible (vent 14 is additionally a junction with a branch ‘gallery’ that originates from the Naubad tank near here).

The Bahmani bequest

A marvel of engineering, the qanat (Arabic for ‘conduit’) or karez (Persian for ‘smaller channels’) system of collecting, transporting, storing and distributing water in arid areas, with very little lost to evaporation, originated in ancient Iran. The first karezs in India were built in Bidar, likely with help of Persian engineers — the Bahmani Sultanate was the first medieval Muslim kingdom to have links with Persia.

Bidar was discovered because of water. Ahmad Shah Bahmani ‘Wali’ was on his way from Berar to Gulbarga when he chanced upon a bamboo grove (bamboo is bidru in Kannada; the art of Bidri metal work that originated here is also said to give the region its name). His platoon of parched soldiers asked a shepherd named Bomkandeshwar where they could find water. The lad pointed to a spring. Soldiers removed stones to discover what later became the mouth of the Shukla Tirth karez. The shepherd had the village and lake that’s still here named after him in perpetuity.

The Naubad karez is likely to have been constructed after his reign was fully established in AD 1427. It was meant to serve a naubad (for new abaadi or population), a settlement that was never completed, leaving the abandoned karez to fill with debris.

Apart from Naubad, there is also a 14-km karez (the longest in India) in Aurangabad that still serves parts of its municipal water network despite neglect. Huge pipelines bring water into the bafflingly cross-connected 12.5-km-long multi-level karez in Bijapur, which may defeat restorers if they ever get there. Reference to a karez system is found in hydrological studies by the Geological Survey of India in Hukkeri near Belagavi. There also exists a six-km-long karez, locally called the kundi bhandara (open well reservoir) in Madhya Pradesh’s Burhanpur, also dysfunctional, but the town once preferred to convey water down this aqueduct’s origin in an alluvial fan (a cone-shaped deposit of sediments) in the Satpura ranges than rely on the Tapti river by which it stands.

Support and challenges

Meanwhile, Govindankutty persuaded C. Kunjambu attan, a highly regarded 76-year-old water diviner from Kerala, to travel by flight for the first time in his life and share his native wisdom at a March 2015 seminar on ‘The Glory That Was Bidar’, inaugurated by the late A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who took a personal interest in the subject and conversed privately with restorers for half an hour. “There is water here,” the old man from Kasaragod said simply, after reading the landscape and its botany, and placing his hands on the earth.

The academic has found supporters in Bidar’s dynamic district collectors: Dr. P.C. Jaffer, Anurag Tewari, and Harsh Gupta, who first tasked him with looking for what they thought were escape tunnels, and from Dr. H.R. Mahadev, who took charge recently. He could also rely upon AKTC’s Muhammed.

Also Read Anurag Tewari: the water man of Bidar

An example of the challenges they face may be seen in the 1.5-km-long Kamthana embankment to the south-west of the city — a perfect oval in Google Maps — which falls on the old route between Bidar and Gulbarga. The breached embankment is seen with its moat in ruins, the adjoining forested areas barren, and the tank to which its water channels lead in shambles.

Other problems persist. A ring road proposed by the Bidar Urban Development Authority’s Master Plan, which connects to the SH15 Naubad-Hyderabad highway and bypasses Bidar town, bifurcates the second of two agricultural zones that used to be fed by the karez, endangering the system. Similarly, new roads connecting the ring road via the Siddheswar and Papanash temples to Bidar town pass through the surrounding grasslands, already under threat with the loss of indigenous tree species like neem, tamarind and jujube. Gliricidia, a water-consumptive ornamental species planted along the edges of the plateau for social forestry, also needs to be replaced with them.

Rapid urban development is causing the unique laterite plateau to erode. The area around the Nanak Jira, sacred to Sikhs, is heavily concretised, with the well here now cemented on all sides and the course of small springs leading to it altered beyond recognition. A railway line cuts through the catchment area of the Naubad embankment, which lies directly above geologic fractures or water movement channels called lineaments.

Well done, more to do

The water warriors continue undeterred. Malge says, “People’s behaviour is the most difficult challenge. We clean and de-silt, water returns and everyone benefits. But the minute we go forward, garbage is dumped again. All we can hope is that the sanctity of these waterbodies will be respected.”

They have plenty more to do. Last year, there wasn’t a drop of water in the 117-acre Vilaspur tank to the north-west of Bidar. De-silted completely, it is now a beautiful expanse of water welcoming migratory birds. The Jahaz ki Bawdi, a 114-feet-deep well in the old city that had 86 feet of silt in it, is also full of water after massive cleaning.

Official help is also at hand. The Department of Tourism is funding some of their restoration work, with an initial outlay of ₹3 crore, followed by an additional ₹5 crore. The Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation has identified the conservation of the Naubad karez system as one of 17 projects shortlisted for a pilot study. The Karnataka government’s Kere Sanjeevini (‘life-giving lakes’) scheme and Koti Vriksha Andolana (‘campaign for one crore trees’) are inspired by Bidar.

The antique land waits patiently. Cart tracks have left furrows on the plateau all the way to Bhalki, 24 km away, separated by disused step wells every kilometre or so, where parched wayfarers and draught animals must have quenched their thirst centuries ago. At an ancient and largely roofless farmhouse in the Naubad embankment, the walls are blocks of laterite so thick that the small homestead appears fortified. A family still lives in here, by a disused brick kiln and cowshed. They share their freshly plucked pulpy berushi mangoes with warm hospitality. The Naubad karez flowing beneath their land is a blessing — four vents lie within their property and they are happy to allow restorers access to them.

High above, the celebrated Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team, which takes off early every morning from the Bidar Air Force Station, flies daring practice sorties in the cloudless sky. Over 600 families of defence personnel rely on water pumped from one of Bidar’s many nameless bawdis near the old temple at Papanash. Somewhere between these aerial and subterranean realities is a third that is both fragile and threatened: though Karnataka is declaring drought, for now, Bidar and its surrounds have water.",2017-04-29 07:00:00+00:00,"['naubad', 'wells', 'vents', 'beat', 'water', 'govindankutty', 'drought', 'bidar', 'work', 'old', 'system', 'karez']",Sri Lanka,news article,English
181,Drought Sri Lanka,"Indian Farmers Protest, Seeking Drought Relief – The Diplomat - The Diplomat",https://thediplomat.com/2017/04/indian-farmers-protest-seeking-drought-relief/,"Advertisement

Fueled by one of the worst droughts in decades, farmers in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, tired of the lack of adequate compensation, severe losses to their livelihoods, and rising rates of suicide took to Delhi to protest. When the National Human Rights Council issued a notice to the state, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami released relief packages for drought hit farmers with compensation dependent upon whether their work was dependent on irrigation or seasonal rain. However, this proved to be inadequate for farmers who had staked or sold their gold or taken on loans with harsh terms, many of whom ultimately decided to fight for fairer compensation.

The protest has just crossed five weeks after having started on March 14 and is geared towards the goal of making the central government aware of their plight. Carrying skulls symbolizing their brethren who died or committed suicide, they demand a larger drought relief package of approximately $6 billion (similar to a loan waiver that was offered to farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh) and a better support price.

In Delhi, they escalated their protest symbolically at multiple stages, beginning with skulls and proceeding to hold rodents to their mouth or eat food off the tar road, mixed with mud, indicating that the government was forcing them to eat dirt as food. After being denied permission to meet any high officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, some stripped and escalated to a nude protest before being apprehended by the police. As they crossed a month, they began to sing funeral songs and symbolically cut marital threads to allude to the plight of the widows of the farmers who committed suicide. Stopping at nothing, they went onto eat grass, hold mock funerals, beat their chests in mourning, and even strip outside the President’s office.

Their tactics and persistence has certainly grabbed attention in certain circles. Other political leaders, including the opposition Indian National Congress’ Vice President Rahul Gandhi, have all met the protesters, and Gandhi in particular berated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not hearing out their plight. In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party held an emergency session and called for a state wide ‘bandh’ or protest on April 25 that will bring services to a halt, in solidarity with the farmers. In a manner similar to the opposition in New Delhi, the DMK has further used this as an opportunity to point to the inability of the state government to fulfill farmers’ demands. The Communist Party of India has also expressed solidarity and begun their own protests, declaring that they will not stop until the farmers have been compensated.

The central government has been placed in an extremely precarious position now as both the resolve and the support base of the farmers gets stronger. Recently, the protesters staged a scene where a man wearing a mask of Modi is shown to be flogging the protesters – alleging that by ignoring them, the prime minister was treating them in a manner tantamount to whipping.

The chances of the farmers gaining their entire demand of compensation remains to be seen as the protests carry on, but their chances of gaining an audience get better everyday.

256,FF-2012-000189-IDN,Alexander as Zulqarnain - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/467252/alexander-as-zulqarnain,"There is, in rural Mandi Bahauddin district, a few kilometres from Phalia town, a village marked as Helan in the Atlas of Pakistan. The ‘a’ is pronounced as in ‘father’ and the ending is nasal as it would be in French. The village is known for a tomb dating to the reign of Akbar the Great . In May 2000, I paused there, met a local ‘historian’ and learned that the word was a mispronunciation of Helen!Now, it was well known that Helen of Troy , said the man, was the wife of Alexander the Macedonian. When she died, Alexander ordered this tomb. Inside, sits an ornate sandstone sarcophagus radiant with flowing curvilinear forms and calligraphy that tells us that the tomb is the last resting place of some Ali Beg. But that did not matter to my new friend.Later, in nearby Mong, the village that takes its name from the Scythian King Maues (1century BCE), known as Moga in Punjabi, I got another educational boost. Seeing that I was on the trail of Alexander, a rather contrary sort of middle-aged man took me under his wing. He spoke of the Macedonian’s victory over Raja Paurava (Greek: Porus) with admirable pride and how folks named their sons after the Macedonian. I asked if folks ever named a son after Paurava, he being one of our own. Pat came an angry, “Kyon? O koi Musalman cee?” Islam being nearly a millennium in the future, Raja Paurava was certainly no Muslim. But then neither was Alexander. On another similar occasion, my interlocutor burst out with an incredulous half-question, half-statement, “Alexander was Hindu?”Interestingly, even semi-educated persons in Pakistan cannot imagine a religion like the Greeks had, with a large pantheon of mostly fun-loving gods. They are caught in a mental box with four names — Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and a very distant and vague Judaism. No other religion appears on their radar.This man in Mong was smarter, however. He countered with the statement that Alexander was mentioned in the Holy Quran. The king we so desperately want to turn into Alexander is the Quranic Zulqarnain whose name means ‘Two-Horned’. He travelled across the great expanse of the world, ruled over a vast kingdom and was responsible for locking away the dreaded nation of Gog and Magog behind a rubble wall steeped in molten lead. This king, we read, travelled to the rising and setting places of the sun. That is, his sway extended across much of the known world of his time.But scripture does not reveal anything beyond this short reference. Now, there were two famous world-conquering kings in history who wore horns on their helmets. Cyrus the Great (ruled BCE 549-529) of Persia and, 200 years later, Alexander of Macedonia. Indeed, the latter’s depiction on coinage with diadem and ram’s horns is very well known.Now, both were great conquerors, therefore, either could be Zulqarnain. But mark: Cyrus established a kingdom only marginally smaller than Alexander’s.This kingdom lasted 200 years until Alexander unravelled it and became master of it. Alexander’s kingdom was larger. His governors presided on the affairs of men from Thrace (Bulgaria) through the Scythian steppes on the northern shores of the Black Sea, to the banks of the Jaxartes (Syr) River (in Uzbekistan) and across the entire Persian Empire, Afghanistan, Punjab and Sindh to Babylon. But it was a short-lived empire, lasting just over a decade until Alexander’s death in 322 BCE.So, really, which king was it that scripture refers to as the ‘Two-Horned’? If greatness were a measure in terms of longevity of kingdom, I would vote Cyrus. However, Alexander who did indeed embody traits that could arguably be termed ‘great’ left behind a kingdom that did not last beyond his own lifetime.But we, in Pakistan, embrace him. We stretch the words of scripture to make Zulqarnain fit into Alexander’s shoes. We do this only because he, an outsider, defeated a king of Punjab who, unfortunately, was a Hindu. We disregard the fact that Raja Paurava (of whose greatness of character I have written earlier in this column) was a Hindu because he predated Islam.Published in The Express Tribune, November 18, 2012.",2012-11-17 08:00:00+00:00,"['alexander', 'king', 'zulqarnain', 'paurava', 'known', 'kingdom', 'scripture', 'tomb', 'great', 'village']",India,news article,English
317,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Hundreds of thousands face hunger in Kenya - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/hundreds-of-thousands-face-hunger-in-kenya/a-19345933,"More than 600,000 residents from West Pokot County are in urgent need of food aid after the region was hit by drought associated with the ongoing El Nino weather phenomena. The weather has dried up waterholes and rivers leading to widespread crop failure.

The Kenyan government had promised to release 50 million Kenya shillings ($5 million, 4.4 million euros) to be used to purchase food aid. Despite the pledge, the government is yet to release the funds forcing residents to move to other counties in search of food and water.

The drought started in February as many were preparing their farms for the planting season. In some areas there was insufficient rain which could not support vegetation. North and South Pokot are the worst hit areas. The areas have not seen a single drop of rain for months.

Local concerns

Residents have pleaded with the government to intervene. Residents fear for the worst if the government doesn't deliver on its promises. Joseph Korikumul is one of them. He said that the drought has not only affected people but also their animals. ""The people of this area continue to suffer as they can't even get milk and food to eat,"" said Korikumul said, adding that, ""our people are suffering a lot due to starvation.""

Another resident, John Kipkurit, said that his farm has never been productive even after he tilled in preparation for the planting season. ""People had plowed their farms since March, but now everything has dried up. As residents of this area we have a big problem,"" he said.

In 2011, Kenya faced one of the worst droughts in history of the country which saw the government distribute relief food to more than 1.7 million people in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

Schools affected

At least two primary schools were reported closed in the county due to food shortages. Children have to walk more than 10 kilometers in search of water instead of being in class.

Korikumul said that the students have no food in their homes or at school. ""If news spreads around that there is no food in schools, then the children are not eager to go to school,"" he said.

The deputy governor of West Pokot, Titus Lotee, is calling on the central government to step in and save the lives of the residents in his county. ""The national government had promised to give us funds to avert hunger in this region. Unfortunately we have yet to receive any money,"" Lotee said. Only 4,000 bags of maize have been distributed to those in the most affected areas by the county government, barely enough to feed them for a week.

The UN has warned that about 36 million people across southern and eastern Africa are facing hunger following the unusually strong El Nino rains coupled with record-high temperatures afterwards.",2016-06-21 07:00:00+00:00,"['thousands', 'hunger', 'face', 'county', 'areas', 'worst', 'school', 'kenya', 'residents', 'west', 'pokot', 'hundreds', 'food', 'drought', 'million']",India,news article,English
1648,FL-2021-000021-IND,"Explained: How to tackle a glacial burst, and how is India prepared - The Indian Express",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/uttarakhand-glacier-flash-flood-rishiganga-death-toll-7180258/,"A glacier break is suspected to have caused the flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli on Sunday. Last October, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which is headed by PM Narendra Modi, had issued detailed guidelines on how to reduce and deal with disasters caused by what is scientifically called Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs).

What are GLOFs and how vulnerable are the Himalayas?

When glaciers melt, the water in glacial lakes accumulates behind loose, natural “glacial/moraine dams” made of ice, sand, pebbles and ice residue. A GLOF refers to the flooding that occurs when the water dammed by a glacier or a moraine is released suddenly.

Unlike earthen dams, the weak structure of the moraine dam leads to the abrupt failure of the dam on top of the glacial lake, which holds large volume of water. A failure of the dam has the potential of releasing millions of cubic metres of water in a short period, causing catastrophic flooding downstream. Peak flows as high as 15,000 cubic metre per second have been recorded in such events.

According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes, which are the major cause of GLOFs. Since glaciers in the Himalayas are in a retreating phase, glacial lakes are growing and pose a potentially large risk to downstream infrastructure and life.

An “Inventory and Monitoring of Glacial Lakes / Water Bodies in the Himalayan Region of Indian River Basins”, sponsored by Climate Change Directorate, Central Water Commission, and done by National Remote Sensing Centre during 2011-15, found that there are 352, 283 and 1,393 glacial lakes and water bodies in the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra basins respectively.

How can the risk be reduced?

The NDMA guidelines say that risk reduction has to begin with identifying and mapping such lakes, taking structural measures to prevent their sudden breach, and establishing mechanism to save lives and property in times of a breach.

According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes. According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes.

Potentially dangerous lakes can be identified based on field observations, records of past events, geomorphologic and geotechnical characteristics of the lake/dam and surroundings, and other physical conditions.

NDMA has recommended use of Synthetic-Aperture Radar imagery to automatically detect changes in water bodies, including new lake formations, during the monsoon months. It has said methods and protocols could also be developed to allow remote monitoring of lake bodies from space.

To manage lakes structurally, the NDMA recommends reducing the volume of water with methods such as controlled breaching, pumping or siphoning out water, and making a tunnel through the moraine barrier or under an ice dam.

A landslide occurred along the Phuktal (tributary to Zanskar river) on December 31, 2014 in Kargil district of Ladakh, leading to a potential flood situation on May 7, 2015. The NDMA created an Expert Task Force which, along with the Army, used explosives to channel water from the river using controlled blasting and manual excavation of debris.

How well is India prepared?

While some work on identification of such lakes has been done by CWC, other aspects are still a work in progress: a robust early warning system, and a broad framework for infrastructure development, construction and excavation in vulnerable zones.

“In contrast to other countries, there are no uniform codes for excavation, construction and grading codes in India. Restricting constructions and development in GLOF/LLOF prone areas is a very efficient means to reduce risks at no cost,” the NDMA guidelines say.

The guidelines say construction of any habitation should be prohibited in the high hazard zone. “Existing buildings are to be relocated to a safer nearby region and all the resources for the relocation have to be managed by Central/State governments. New infrastructures in the medium hazard zone have to be accompanied by specific protection measures.”

The guidelines emphasise the importance of land use planning: “There are no widely accepted procedures or regulation in India for land use planning in the GLOF/LLOF prone areas. Such regulations need to be developed… There should be monitoring systems prior to, during, and after construction of infrastructure and settlements in the downstream area.”

Are there early warning systems in place?

The number of implemented and operational GLOF EWS is still very small, even at the global scale. In the Himalayan region, there are at three reported instances (two in Nepal and one in China) of implementation of sensor- and monitoring-based technical systems for GLOF early warning.

India, though, has a remarkable history of successful warnings in relation to Landslide Lake Outburst Floods (LLOFs), dating back to the 19th century. In 1894, a landslide in Gohna, Uttarakhand dammed the main river. On July 5 that year, the engineer in charge estimated the lake would overflow the dam in mid-August, which eventually happened.

Despite the devastating impact of the flood, including washing away of most buildings along the river and severe destruction in Srinagar, no victims were reported, thanks to the precise prediction and the early warning to the population. This was made possible by the installation of a telephone line between the lake and the downstream towns of Chamoli, Srinagar etc.

Rescue operations continued well into the night on Monday as personnel of the ITBP, NDRF and Army worked to locate around 170 people, mostly labourers working at two power projects, who are still reported missing.

What are the guidelines for rescue?

Apart from pressing specialised forces such as NDRF, ITBP and the Army, NDMA has emphasised the need for trained local manpower.

“Experience has shown that over 80 percent of search and rescue is carried out by the local community before the intervention of the state machinery and specialised search and rescue teams. Thus, trained and equipped teams consisting of local people must be set up in GLOF and LLOF prone areas,” NDMA has said. These local teams, it has said, will also assist in planning and setting up emergency shelters, distributing relief packages, identifying missing people, and addressing the needs for food, healthcare, water supply etc.

It has also called for a comprehensive alarm systems. “Besides classical alarming infrastructure consisting of acoustic alarms by sirens, modern communication technology using cell and smart phones can complement or even replace traditional alarming infrastructure,” NDMA has said.

It has asked for provision of heavy earthmoving and search and rescue equipment, as well as motor launches, country boats, inflatable rubber boats, life jackets etc. Acknowledging that a disaster spot in the Himalayas can at times be inaccessible to earthmovers, NDMA has recommended “innovative methods using locally available natural resources”. “It is important to innovate and design lighter machinery, which are more suitable to be carried in the mountains in a disassembled form,” it has said, suggesting these parts can be carried in a helicopter.

For emergency medical response, NDMA has called for Quick Reaction Medical Teams, mobile field hospitals, Accident Relief Medical Vans, and heli-ambulances in areas inaccessible by roads. The guidelines also call for psychological counselling of victims, apart from dissemination of accurate information through press conferences and mass media.",2021-02-15 08:00:00+00:00,"['itbp', 'lakes', 'river', 'guidelines', 'explained', 'prepared', 'india', 'water', 'glacial', 'lake', 'tackle', 'burst', 'ndma', 'uttarakhand', 'rescue']",India,news article,English
1053,DR-2016-000142-MOZ,2016 Strategic Response Plan: Mozambique - Mozambique - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/2016-strategic-response-plan-mozambique,"Summary

Mozambique is experiencing its most severe drought in more than 30 years. The drought is affecting approximately 1.5 million people in seven provinces in the Southern and Central regions of the country. Due to the seriousness of the situation, the Government extended the institutional red alert for the most drought-affected provinces of Tete, Sofala, Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, Zambezia and Maputo.

The revised strategic response plan is targeting about 1.2 million people affected by drought with food security and other interventions in the seven provinces affected until the end of March 2017. The plan also includes a contingency for 190,000 persons that may be affected by floods and cyclones during the same period.

The HCT developed the SRP in April 2016 to support the Government in responding the current drought. The plan was reviewed in November 2016 and has three strategic objectives, namely:

Provide immediate life-saving and life-sustaining assistance to the most vulnerable members of the populations affected by droughts in the form of food assistance and agricultural inputs, the availability of clean water and nutrition supplements.

Support the restoration of livelihoods of the drought-affected population through Early Recovery and resilience-building activities

To promote continued access to education services and ensure coordination and mainstreaming of protection initiatives in drought response interventions.

In terms of funding, the total cost to implement the current plan is estimated at US$ 211 million. The drought emergency response is valued at US$ 179 million. A contingency amount of US$ 32 million has been budgeted for the possible floods/cyclones emergency response. The total funding available for the drought response is 121 million US$, leaving a gap of approximately US$ 58 million. The emergency response will ensure that the most vulnerable members of those affected by drought and other extreme weather phenomena are prioritized in the delivery of assistance.

Efforts will be made to ensure that farmers are provided with seeds and other agricultural inputs, to ensure that they are able to plant their crops when the rains arrive and reap an abundant harvest in March of 2017. Furthermore, food assistance is planned to be provided to the most affected population in the seven provinces.

The protection cluster will provide advisory support to governement and humanitarian actors so that the response is gender-sensitive. They will also advocate for an appropriate response for targeting the most vulnerable and excluded.

The nutrition cluster will engage in active screening and case management of malnourished cases (both children and pregnant and lactating women) at the community level, and support infant and young child feeding in emergencies.

The education cluster will provide support to school feeding in prioritised areas, temporary learning spaces and teaching and learning materials for children and teachers affected by drought, flood, cyclones and/or military conflict. The cluster will further coordinate preparedness interventions and assess the current response capacity to respond to possible emergencies.

The WASH cluster will work to improve the access of potable water of households affected by drought through (i) water trucking where there were no other response options, (ii) drilling new boreholes where waters tables have dropped significantly, (iii) distribution of chlorine water treatment product (certeza) and (iv) rehabilitation/upgrading of existing community water points.",2016-12-31 08:00:00+00:00,"['mozambique', 'response', 'plan', 'affected', 'support', 'drought', 'ensure', 'million', 'strategic', 'cluster', '2016', 'vulnerable', 'water']",Mozambique,news article,English

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, this past Saturday began the first in a series of airlifts to western Afghanistan bringing thousands of tents for people displaced by a mix of conflict and an ongoing severe drought.

Together the drought and ongoing conflict have seen over quarter of a million Afghans being displaced in this region of the country since April.

Currently, some 220,000 families are living in makeshift shelters in the western provinces of Herat, Badghis and Ghor. And, with winter approaching, in conditions that are increasingly desperate. Already we are seeing an increase in child deaths.

UNHCR’s airlift will comprise 12 flights in total, bringing 15,100 family size tents – with the aim of easing the plight of almost half the displaced population. The tents are being loaded in Pakistan’s Lahore and being shipped in as close as possible to the affected populations via the airport at Herat. There, ground crews have been handing them over to our partners for delivery.

The tents are part of a larger aid delivery being organized by the Afghan Government and its partners to Herat and Badghis. With many displaced having settled on private land and facing risk of eviction, UNHCR is also supporting the Government’s efforts to make land available.

1993,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Qatar LNG Plans To Flood World Market  gCaptain - gcaptain.com - gcaptain.com,https://gcaptain.com/qatar-lng-world-market-exports/,"By Anna Shiryaevskaya (Bloomberg) The worlds top exporter of liquefied natural gas is ramping up production dramatically and undercutting competitors in a bid to squeeze them out the market.

Qatar is dropping prices and pushing ahead with a $29 billion project to boost its exports of the fuel by more than 50%, stymieing the prospects of new plants elsewhere. Its also established a trading team to compete in the nascent spot market and pushing into Asia more aggressively, according to people familiar with the matter.

The strategy marks a shift for Qatar, which has barely raised production in the past five years and traditionally prioritized prices over market share. Increased competition, especially from the U.S. and Australia, has forced the Persian Gulf state to become more nimble and attract buyers in Asia, a hot spot for gas demand.

The global transition to renewable energy is adding to the countrys sense of urgency. While LNG was until recently touted as a bridge from coal and oil to the likes of solar and wind power, its falling out of favor with some governments as they step up efforts to slow climate change.

Qatars expansion plan is so huge that there are questions on the need for other supply options, said Julien Hoarau, head of EnergyScan, the analytics unit of the French utility Engie SA. Its still the number one, but the U.S. has never been so close, so Qatar needed to move if it wanted to keep its leading position.

The U.S. came close to overtaking Qatars monthly exports for the first time in April, while Australia has been neck-in-neck with the Middle Eastern nation for the last year, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. As Gulf Coast projects develop, the U.S. is slated to briefly become the worlds top supplier by 2024, before Qatar regains that status later in the decade, according to BloombergNEF.

Several factors are playing into Qatars hands. China, one of the fastest growing LNG markets, has been reluctant to import more from the U.S. or Australia due to trade and geopolitical tensions.

But Qatars main advantage is that it has the worlds lowest production costs thanks to an abundance of easy-to-extract gas, most of it contained in the giant North Field that extends into Iran.

Bonds Coming

Qatars state energy company, which may soon sell up to $10 billion of bonds to fund the gas expansion, said the project will be viable even with oil at $20 a barrel, 70% less than current levels. LNG contracts are typically linked to oil.

Thats enabling Qatar Petroleum to set pricing below what other exporters can manage, according to traders. The firm has sold LNG in recent months at around 10% of Brent crude prices, including to China and Pakistan, whereas it used to set the level at 15%.

Nobody can compete with Qatari costs, said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies. They can do whatever they like and everybody will have to respond the way they can. And, especially when the market is in surplus and prices are low, that will impact the competitions profits.

QP executives have jetted across Asia over the past few months to ink export deals. Their efforts led in March to a 10-year contract with Beijing-based Sinopec, signed at 10%-10.19% of Brent.

Qatars Ministry of Energy and QP didnt respond to requests for comment.

A few years ago, demand for LNG was projected to rise steeply over the coming decades. Gas emits less carbon dioxide than most other fossil fuels when its burned, while renewable-energy projects were still too expensive to power electricity grids, factories and transport on a mass scale.

But solar and wind technology is improving faster than expected, helped in part by massive government green-spending programs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

Were Not Afraid

Even as Qatar seeks to make the most of its assets, there are obstacles to it reaching total domination. Many buyers want a diverse group of suppliers. Russias Yamal LNG project and the planned Arctic LNG 2 plant, led by Novatek PJSC, are among those that will remain competitive as Qatar ramps up exports, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.

The biggest U.S. LNG exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc., said its unperturbed by Qatars moves. Some importers are attracted by American firms offering more flexible delivery terms and pricing thats not tied to oil, which has soared almost 30% this year.

Were not afraid, Chenieres Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin told investors this month. Were part of a sort of diversification of the supply and contracting structure along with Qatar Petroleum and our friends at Novatek.

Yet U.S. projects are among those most likely to struggle. At least 10, five of them in Texas and four in Louisiana, probably wont secure enough financing to be completed, according to analysis from BloombergNEF.

Feedstock costs are part of the problem. American companies have to buy gas at around $2.50 per million British thermal units, way above Qatars wellhead prices of $0.30 or lower.

New suppliers in the U.S. need spot LNG prices to be at least $7.80 per million Btu in Asia and $6.80 in Europe, said David Thomas, an independent adviser and former head of LNG at Vitol, the worlds largest independent oil trader. For comparison, Asian rates have averaged about $6.80 over the last five years. The economics for producers in Australia and Africa are similar, Thomas said.

The lack of new supply from other countries will benefit Qatar, Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi, who is also chief executive officer of QP, said in an interview with Bloomberg in February. Our expansion is very timely, he said.

The Qatari strategy appears to be maintaining its global market share and also maximizing sales, before the gas market starts to shrink, OIESs Stern said. It is a competitive and strategic rush. They recognize LNG demand will eventually decline as the world moves forward in the energy transition.

238,FF-2012-000189-IDN,South Sudan: UNHCR warns that hepatitis E risk is growing - UNHCR,https://www.unhcr.org/509cedcd9.html,"With funding depleted for our operations in South Sudan, UNHCR is warning today that capacity to contain an outbreak of hepatitis E among the refugee population is increasingly stretched. The risks will grow if, as currently anticipated, we see fresh inflows of refugees from South Kordofan and Blue Nile states in neighbouring Sudan.

Due to insecurity and worsening humanitarian conditions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, we expect thousands of new refugees to cross in the next weeks, as soon as roads become passable after the rainy season.

UNHCR and partners (Solidarités International, Goal, Oxfam, IOM, IMC, Medair and MSF together with the national health authorities) are already fighting an outbreak of Hepatitis E in Upper Nile and Unity states, two regions where the disease is endemic and where 175,000 Sudanese refugees are settled.

We have seen 1,050 cases of Hepatitis E in the refugee camps, a virus contracted and spread through consuming contaminated food and water. The disease damages the liver and can be fatal. To date, 26 refugees have died in camps in Upper Nile. This is 10 more deaths since mid-September.

The risk of infection is high in densely populated settings such as refugee camps. This is further exacerbated in the rainy season due to flooding and poor sanitation. Women and small children are the most vulnerable.

Early diagnosis is also crucial for the survival of patients. We are working with the US Centers for Disease Control which has sent six staff to test water and blood samples and conduct house-to-house interviews on hygiene practices.

To counter the spread of the disease among the 175,000 Sudanese refugees already in South Sudan, we are promoting better hygiene practices through hundreds of trained community workers. In all camps this community outreach exercise includes active case finding. We have also been working to improve the supply of clean water in the camps, as well as upgrade latrine stances, and provide more hand washing-stations and soap.

These measures have helped to slow the spread of the disease. However, we are struggling to meet the minimum humanitarian standards such as the provision of 15 to 20 litres of safe drinking water per refugee per day or building enough latrines so that each unit is shared by no more than 20 refugees.

The south Sudan operation is seriously underfunded. UNHCR needs a minimum of US$20 million until the end of the year to keep up basic lifesaving activities. Of our revised appeal for $186 million, only 40 per cent has been received so far. International NGOs also need additional funding beyond that amount to ensure that all activities can be carried out as needed.

COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government, on Friday, for the first time, successfully tested artificial rain in a drought-hit area to provide clean water for hundreds of families.

The Power and Energy Ministry, in a statement, said the Ceylon Electricity Board together with the Sri Lanka Air Force conducted the project, which caused rainfall for 45 minutes in the catchment areas of the Maussakelle Reservoir, in the Central Province.

A Sri Lanka Air Force helicopter was used to spray chemicals on the clouds, 8,000 feet above the reservoir, resulting in 45 minutes of rainfall.

""Observing the success of the pilot project which commenced today, Power and Energy Minister Ravi Karunanayake has instructed relevant authorities to take necessary measures to create artificial rains in the next few days until the dry weather exists in the country,"" the ministry said.

The pilot project was launched following assistance from a special team who had arrived in Sri Lanka from Thailand.

The ministry said the aim of the project is to create rains during the drought seasons.

The team’s algorithm adjusts 40 different attributes in photos that the researchers determined are connected to our perception of weather. The resulting software can easily alter a lush green landscape to make it appear covered in snow or subjected to drought.

“Programs like Photoshop are really powerful, but you basically need to be an artist to use them. We want anybody to be able to manipulate photographs as easily as you’d manipulate text.” said James Hays, Manning Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown.

To identify the attributes that enable us to identify weather in photos, the scientists commissioned Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing engine to rate photos based on perceptual and subjective qualities. Does a certain photo show a sunset or a sunrise? Is it gloomy or clear? You can explore an interactive version of the team’s data set at their project website, or use weather attributes to search the catalog of images that went into the development of the algorithm.

· Between December 2020 and late April 2021, most parts of Somalia experienced moderate to severe drought as a result of below-average Deyr season rainfall from October to December 2020, warmer-than-normal temperatures during the January to March 2021 Jilaal season and a delayed, poor start and performance of 2021 Gu (March/April to June) season rainfall. Further rainfall is expected through mid-May, covering many parts of the country. However, cumulative rainfall amounts are likely to remain below average in many parts of central and southern Somalia. Moreover continuation of the Gu rains in late May through June is uncertain. Accordingly, the 2021 Gu season cereal production in Somalia is expected to be 20-40 percent below average.

· Pasture, browse and water availability continued to deteriorate/or deplete in most of northern and central Somalia and large parts of southern Somalia. Extreme water shortages, widespread reliance on water trucking, and high water prices have been reported in most pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihood zones since January. Most livestock are concentrated near water points with limited migration options. Cases of abortion and livestock death among small ruminants have occurred due to insufficient feed, water, and drought-induced disease in several regions in northern and central Somalia.

· Due to the extended impact of the drought between late December 2020 and late April 2021, the food security situation in most rural livelihoods of northern and central Somalia has deteriorated. Due to limited herd size, lack of saleable animals, lack of access to milk, increased expenditures and high debt levels, most poor pastoral households in northern and central regions face food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between April and September 2021.

· The food security situation in southern Somalia has also continued to deteriorate since the beginning of 2021, driven by the negative impacts of below average 2020 Deyr season main and off-season harvests, a harsh Jilaal that evolved into drought conditions, the delayed, poor start of 2021 Gu season rainfall, and insecurity on agricultural employment opportunities, crop development, and livestock production. Accordingly, most livelihood zones of southern Somalia are currently classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2). However, a rising share of poor households in these livelihood zones face food consumption gaps, and several areas are projected to be classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between July and September 2021.

· Most of the IDPs in the main settlements and the urban poor are currently facing food consumption gaps due to limited income-generating activities and rising staple food prices that have reduced household purchasing power. As a result, they have been classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between April and June 2021. Given rising food prices and reduced income and employment opportunities, food security outcomes are likely to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) among IDPs in the main settlements and among poor urban households between July and September 2021.

· Approximately 2.73 million to 2.83 million people across Somalia are expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes between April and September 2021, reflecting the deteriorating food security situation in the country.

· Food assistance reached an average of 1.6 million people per month between January and April 2021. Humanitarian assistance is preventing further deterioration of food security outcomes at the household level in many areas. However, given the scale of need, current level of food assistance is inadequate to prevent widespread Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. Given the worsening food security situation across Somalia, assistance must be scaled up and sustained through the end of the year.",2021-05-17 19:43:41+00:00,"['water', 'season', 'jiaal', 'security', 'ipc', 'food', 'nutrition', 'phase', 'poor', 'warning', 'gu', 'issued', 'impact', 'quarterly', 'crisis', '2021', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

""I am honored to be making my Studio debut with this poignant, urgent play about the importance of a diverse community coming together to reflect on the history of injustice in our country while sparking a new dialogue about the hope and change that we can inspire together,"" said Douglas. ""I believe wholeheartedly in the power of theatre, and plays like Until the Flood specifically, to catalyze conversations that can spur civic change and empathy and am excited to share this fervent call to action with DC audiences.""

Dael Orlandersmith is one of the stalwarts of solo performance in the United States,"" said Studio Artistic Director David Muse. ""Her plays are vivid and deeply humane, both intensely personal and broadly relatable. With Until the Flood, we welcome her back to Studio with a timely story of a community in the aftermath of a shooting that changed the conversation about racial justice and police brutality.""

568,Drought Sri Lanka,Resolving long felt water scarcity in Anuradhapura - Sri Lanka - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/resolving-long-felt-water-scarcity-anuradhapura,"Anuradhapura is the largest district in the country with a population of around 893,000 across 717,900 hectares. There were nearly 3,000 major, medium and small-scale tanks and irrigation works in ancient Sri Lanka dating from the reign of King Pandukabhaya in 300 BC.The government has given priority to provide potable drinking water to the people. Around 1,500 tanks in the Anuradhapura district are in a state of dilapidation, filled with sediment. The tanks have been contracting due to sediment disposal and thus, water capacity is dwindling. The people in the district suffered from the acute shortage of both drinking and irrigational water during the last two years due to the prolonged drought.

The government spent around Rs. 3,000 million to extend drought relief facilities such as dry food rations for the victimised families. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), in collaboration with the National Community Water Supply Department and the Sri Lanka Navy, is engaged in remedying the problem of acute shortage of drinking water by installing reverse osmosis filtering devices in the dry zone which includes the North Central Province as well. It is learnt that the government spent Rs. 109,153 million in 2018 for the provision of potable drinking water. Between 2015 and 2018, eighteen new water supply projects were commissioned, while 440,220 new water connections were given to the people.

Anuradhapura-North water project - Phase I

Three mega water supply schemes are emerging in the Anuradhapura district. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Chinese government are providing financial and technological assistance for these water projects. Under the Anuradhapura-North mega water project - Phase I, Mihinthale - Mahakanadarawa tank which holds a water capacity of 35,000 acre feet has been selected as the main water source. The tank would release 6,700 cubic metres of water per day on the basis of 2,000 acre feet annually. Under the proposed water project, Rs. 300 million is to be spent for the modernisation of the tank and the irrigation canal system as a prerequisite to the water project.

The construction work of Phase I of the Anuradhapura-North water project is due to be completed before the end of 2020.

The construction work of the water project is now in progress. It has been estimated that a population of around 75,000 in 30 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions in the Medawachchiya, Rambewa and Mihinthale Divisional Secretariat (DS) Divisions which are considered as kidney disease-prone areas will benefit from the emerging Anuradhapura-North water project Phase I.

A water purification plant with a capacity of treating 9,400 cubic metre water per day is coming up adjoining to the Mahakanadarawa tank bund. Its capacity of water intake is 39,600 cubic metres. There are three ground reservoirs in Rambewa (1,500 cubic metres), Medawachchiya (1,000 cubic metres) and Pihimbiyagollewa (250 cubic metres), in addition to the four main water towers put up in Isinbassagala, Rambewa, Ethakada and Pihimbiyagollewa which together hold a water capacity of 4,000 cubic metres.

The main transmission pipeline is 89 kilometres long. The distribution sub-pipeline is 340 kilometres in length. The uPVC sub-distribution main which is 3,400 kilometres long has been completed. It has been designed to feed the Mahakanadarawa water source with an additional 56,750 acre feet of water from the Moragahakanda reservoir through the Upper Elahera and the NCP canal via the Manankattiya and Eruwewa tanks within the next five years.

Anuradhapura-North water project - Phase II

The JICA extends financial support for the proposed Anuradhapura-North water supply project Phase II. The remaining areas of Anuradhapura-North will receive water through the Anuradhapura-North water supply project Phase II. The Yan Oya reservoir in the Horowpathana DS Division will supply water for this project.

The main target of the Phase II is to ensure the supply of safe pipe borne drinking water to the population of around 193,319 in the DS divisions - Padaviya, Horowpathana, Kahatagasdigiliya and Kebithigollewa in the Anuradhapura district, covering 119 GN divisions. Under this scheme, Kallikulam and Vedivaiththakalu GN divisions in the Vavuniya district will also be partially covered, in addition to the 119 GN divisions.

The project is partly funded by the JICA with the Sri Lankan government funding the balance. The consultancy contract for design and procurement commenced on May 1, 2018. The detailed design and procurement are expected to be finished in February 2020 and thereafter, the implementation will follow immediately. A loan of JPY 23,137,000,000 has been granted for the project.

In the meantime, the construction work of the Thambuththegama water project in the Mahaweli H Area is to be started shortly. This project will cater to around 14,000 people in 42 GN divisions in the Thambuththegama, Galnewa and Thalawa DS Divisions. Here, the water source is the Rajangane reservoir (85,000 acre feet) and the intake of water per day would be 42,000 cubic metres.

The water treatment plant is capable of treating 18,000 cubic metres of water per day and the project consists of three towers with 1,500 cubic metres water capacity in each. A transmission pipeline extends to 52 kilometres, while the main distribution line is 135 kilometres in length. The capacity of raw water transmission is 27,000 cubic metres a day. It is learnt that submissions of preliminary design are in progress and construction work is scheduled to be completed by June 2021. However, farmers who come under the Rajangane reservoir project have vehemently objected to the daily water intake in fear that such a move would badly affect their cultivations and at present, the NWSDB in collaboration with irrigation authorities is trying to convince them of the benefits of the water project and explain to them that the water intake would not affect their crops.

Yan Oya reservoir project

Apart from these major water projects, the Anuradhapura Yan Oya reservoir project is nearing completion at a cost of Rs. 39,000 million. The reservoir’s water capacity is 149,000 acre feet. The project is to be completed shortly once the construction of the left and the right bank canals is over.

The Padaviya area has been suffering from an acute shortage of water since the Padaviya reservoir (85,000 acre feet) depends on rainfall as it has no permanent water source to feed it. The reservoir will be provided adequate water through the 20-kilometre long right bank canal. Also, the construction work of lower Malwathu Oya reservoir will commence soon.The reservoir which emerges in the proximity of historic Thanthirimale holds a water capacity of 169,000 acre feet and costs Rs. 15,000 million.",2019-06-10 07:00:00+00:00,"['scarcity', 'metres', 'supply', 'felt', 'cubic', 'lanka', 'water', 'sri', 'phase', 'capacity', 'long', 'feet', 'project', 'reservoir', 'divisions', 'anuradhapura', 'resolving']",Sri Lanka,news article,English

486,DR-2021-000054-SOM,Horn of Africa facing fresh food shortage - The East African,https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/horn-of-africa-facing-fresh-food-shortage-3399002,"By MARY WAMBUI More by this Author

The Horn of Africa region is staring at food shortages after the delayed start of the long rains in some countries and below-average rainfall in others.

The UN and the government of Somalia have jointly declared drought in the country after officials determined that 80 percent of Somalia had received little rainfall. Usually, much of the Horn considers March to May as a planting season.

However, projections by the Famine Early Warnings Systems Network and the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and Red Crescent Societies indicate that the situation is likely to get worse as we get into May down to September if the weather situation does not change.

“In eastern Africa, worse outcomes are expected through May 2021 across much of the region (North East Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia — including the restive Tigray region) attributed to conflict and displacement, long term macroeconomic challenges, the economic impacts of Covid-19, multiple weather shocks and the desert locust upsurge,” the IFRC Food Insecurity and Hunger for Africa bulletin says.

A situational report by the Federal Government of Somalia and humanitarian partners said the country is experiencing moderate to severe drought and warned that the population there was on the “brink of human catastrophe.”

Somalia’s Humanitarian Response Plan requires $1.09 billion to assist about four million people, and more than three million who are in acute need.

In Somalia, drought is almost routine, appearing once in every two years. Since 1990, it has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards including 12 droughts and 19 floods.

This is three times the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990.

In Kenya, Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture Peter Munya announced on April 14 that the country will not be facing an acute maize shortage at least until later in the year, saying “We will have a surplus of at least 11.8 million bags by the end of May.”

An assessment by the Kenya Food Security Steering Group in February puts the population at risk at over 1.4 million people who are in need of urgent life-saving support.

IFRC notes that in South Sudan, 60 per cent of the population (7.2 million people) are expected to face acute food insecurity between April and July.

“This includes 2.4 million in emergency situations and 108,000 people in catastrophic situations,” the federation states.

Ethiopia, just like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan and Somalia is facing one of its worst locust outbreaks in 25 years rendering crop production, food security and millions of lives at the dire risk of starvation.

Tigray region is particularly in an “extremely grave” quoting remarks made by the High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi who alongside a high ranking team of UN officials toured the region in February to assess the humanitarian situation on the ground.

“People need all possible forms of support; food items, non-food items, medicine, water, shelter and access to banks and telecommunication systems,” Grandi told journalists in Addis Ababa.

He added that though the government of Ethiopia had reported on some progress being made in improving the security situation in the region, isolated incidents are still taking place resulting in looting, various kinds of violence including rape and the unfortunate loss of six humanitarian workers.

On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed the need for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to end the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights crisis in the country including the growing “risk of famine” in Tigray region.

This year, drought conditions are expected to increase displacement and have a lasting impact on livelihoods and food security outcomes with at least 3.4 million people projected to be affected by drought conditions 380,000 are expected to be displaced by the end of this year.

“The cost of inaction is far too dire and the time to take action is now. Urgent and immediate collective action, including scaling-up of response and funding, is needed now to mitigate a full-scale disaster,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator Adam Abdelmoula.",2021-05-13 07:00:00+00:00,"['region', 'million', 'including', 'facing', 'shortage', 'africa', 'food', 'security', 'situation', 'drought', 'expected', 'fresh', 'humanitarian', 'horn', 'somalia']",Somalia,news article,English

The National Agricultural Research Institute of Mozambique (IIAM) is developing a number of improved seeds to help farmers, including the drought-tolerant Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) varieties. The WEMA project is a cooperative effort coordinated by the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) and involving public sector scientists in South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.

Though the research is still in its early stages in Mozambique, scientists and other stakeholders are upbeat WEMA will make vast difference in the lives of farmers. “The idea is to bring technology that will improve the production and productivity of these small farmers,” [Samuel Camilo, head of the Chokwe Research Station of the National Agricultural Research Institute (IIAM) of Mozambique] explained. “What we are trying to do is to test crops or varieties that are tolerant to drought stress.

586,Drought Sri Lanka,8 Innovative Drought Solutions That We Can Count On - Interesting Engineering,https://interestingengineering.com/8-innovative-drought-solutions-that-we-can-count-on,"A drought happens when a region receives less than average rainfall. Unlike the simplicity of this definition, the actual scenario is devastating.

Droughts don’t just affect the plants or livestock of a region, but they also pose a great threat to human lives. It is regarded as a natural disaster considering the damage it does to the entire ecosystem.

We have seen examples of how droughts can create great economic instabilities, owing to the lessened production of resources. In the past 40 years, no natural disaster has affected more people than droughts.

RELATED: 6 MAJOR RIVERS FACING DROUGHT-LIKE SITUATIONS FROM OVERUSE

Climate change has been a major factor in the creation of droughts in several parts of the world. As the earth is heating up, many regions of the world are experiencing less precipitation and droughts are becoming more common than ever before.

However, we humans have the ability to think and use our skills to engineer solutions, and in this article, we will go through some of these methods.

1. Desalination of water

Even though more than 70% of the earth’s surface is covered with water, only 0.003% of it is fresh water. In many places of the world, annual rainfall is the only way to replenish the freshwater sources.

But what if we could desalinate water? Then we have oceans to help us get fresh water.

But it is easier said than done. Desalination of water is pretty resource intensive. First, the water needs to be boiled, converted to steam and then condensed.

This requires a significant amount of fossil fuels to produce heat. But hope is still at hand as the developments in the field has made filters made up of graphene that can desalinate water with nothing more than hydrostatic pressure.

2. Rainwater harvesting

Rainwater harvesting has seen major growth in recent years and this is something everyone should adopt. With rainwater harvesting, homes can store the water they get from rain and then use it when they need it in dry conditions.

In urban areas, only 15% of rainwater enters the ground while in rural areas 50% of rainwater is absorbed into the ground. Rainwater harvesting provides both urban and rural areas with an efficient option to store rainwater and then reuse it in times of drought.

If a house has a primary water source, then rainwater harvesting provides them with an auxiliary option that they can use when water is not available. Rainwater harvesting is a great way to combat drought and is now encouraged among farmers and herders to provide their agriculture with water in times of drought.

3. Drip irrigation

Drip irrigation hopes to achieve optimum water delivery for plants and optimum moisture in the soil. The advantage of such a system is that it does not result in water wastage.

Nowadays, many companies have come forward providing the market with cost-effective and intuitive drip irrigation systems.

Technologically advanced farms are moving towards IoT inspired drip irrigation systems that can operate without human intervention. The highly targeted nature of drip irrigation ensures that each plant gets the right amount of water delivered right on its roots.

4. Harvesting water from the air

Air as we know it contains many elements, and one among it is moisture. If we could build something efficient to harvest that moisture and condense it, we could harvest water from the air.

And this is what researchers from MIT have done!

This solar powered device uses a large surface area of the pores in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to catch water vapor and pass it between two temperatures zones to condense it. A field test conducted in Arizona was a success and now the team hopes to scale up the system so that it can produce many liters of water within a short period of time.

The two major advantages of this system are that it can harvest water without the use of electricity and the ability to produce water in desert climates.

5. Crop engineering

We can build new mechanisms outside of the plants to keep them watered and safe from drought, but we could also genetically engineer them to be resilient to conditions where the water content in the soil is very low.

Food production is a crucial part of keeping the population alive. However, droughts can affect the productivity and tip the balance of food available to the masses.

Crop engineering hopes to tweak the genetics of existing crops to help them increase their yield and provide them with better resistance to drought.

A research project from Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE) has successfully improved corps in the way they use water, up to 25% more efficiently.

Researches have been done by various organizations around the world in efforts to engineer crops that can withstand the harshness of droughts.

6. Solar pumps

The most common method that we use to water crops or provide water to livestock is by pumping it out of the earth. However, pumps do consume electricity, which in turn, consumes more fossil fuels.

Solar pumps are gaining popularity because they do not use up electricity from the mains to pump water for irrigation. The governments around the world are realizing the potential of solar pumps and some have even started granting subsidies for farmers to install them cost-effectively.

7. Recycling organic waste

One of the best ways to improve water retention capabilities of soil is to add organic matter into it. Organic material has been found to increase the water retention capabilities of the soil.

Nowadays, many farmers use organic wastes from supermarkets to mix with the soil so that the crops can thrive in it without needing frequent water. As the temperatures rise, the soil starts to lose its water faster and this is a viable way to reduce organic wastes from shops and markets and also improve crop yields.

8. Planting more trees

This might sound like old-age advice, but planting tree is the best way to reduce damage from drought, improve the quality of the environment and increase the success of precipitation.

Many countries have started their efforts by turning arid lands into forested by planting trees and saplings.

379,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"More Afghans displaced by drought than conflict, U.N. says - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-drought-idUSKCN1LR0UZ,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A total of 275,000 people have been displaced by drought in western Afghanistan - 52,000 more than the number uprooted by conflict this year - with over two million threatened by the effects of water shortages, the United Nations said.

Reports from the U.N. and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow following crop failures in some areas and livestock dying for the want of anything to eat.

Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.

In a regular update, the U.N. humanitarian office reported that 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in Qala-e-Naw city in Badghis province in the week to Sept. 9.

A second U.N. report, with data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month. It estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.

In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.

The U.N. cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International that 99 percent of people in Badghis said their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.

“The assessment also indicates that most farmers lost last season’s harvest and nearly all of them lack seeds for new planting season,” the U.N. report said, noting reports that about 40 per cent of livestock has been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder.

The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a U.S. funded food security monitoring service, said in a report on Aug. 31 that the number of Afghans in a food “crisis” was atypically high.

“Crisis” is step three on a five step scale, where four is “emergency” and five is “catastrophe” and possible famine.

In Badghis and Faryab provinces, emergency outcomes are expected to emerge in January, FEWS NET said.

“Normally during this time period, food security outcomes begin to seasonally improve in much of the country, but due to drought and severe reduction in wheat production, reduced labor opportunities, and continued conflict more households face Crisis outcomes than normal,” it said.",2018-09-11 07:00:00+00:00,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'food', 'step', 'badghis', 'drought', 'million', 'worse', 'seeds', 'conflict', 'report', 'aid', 'outcomes']",Afghanistan,news article,English

The Barcelona forward was dismissed towards the end of the first half of Saturday's third-place play-off in Sao Paulo against Chile following a confrontation with midfielder Gary Medel, who was also shown a red card.

Messi appeared to have been hard done by, with Medel appearing to push his head towards the Argentina playmaker as they squared up, chest to chest.

Image: Messi was dismissed towards the end of the first half

The Argentina captain suggested he had been singled out following his comments over the ""crazy"" officiating in the wake of their 2-0 semi-final defeat by hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte.

""We don't need to be part of the corruption that we've suffered at this tournament,"" Messi said, as quoted by Spanish media outlet AS.

""Medel is always right at the limit. With a yellow that would have been the end of it for both of us, but well, maybe what I said recently had an impact.

""What's important is that the team finished well in the tournament. Maybe this was ordered and I ended up suffering because of what I said.""

When asked about his thoughts on Sunday's final, Messi said: ""Hopefully the referees and the VAR won't influence things and they let Peru compete, but I think that's unlikely.""

Head coach Lionel Scaloni was also left perplexed by some of the decisions.

""Either the criteria is bad, or they don't agree. It seems to me that they are not yet clear about the VAR system,"" he said at a press conference.

On the red card for his captain, Scaloni said: ""I still don't understand what Messi did to be dismissed.""

CONMEBOL level ""disrespect"" claim in response

The South American football confederation, Conmebol, said questioning the integrity of the Copa America is ""unacceptable"" and that a ""fundamental pillar of fair play is to accept the results with loyalty and respect"".

Although it does not mention Messi by name, the statement said: ""The same goes for refereeing decisions, which are human and will always be improvable.

""It is unacceptable that as a result of incidents typical in competitions, involving 12 teams, all on equal terms, unfounded accusations have been launched that lack the truth and question the integrity of the Copa America.

""These accusations represent a lack of respect for the competition, all the participating players and the hundreds of professionals of CONMEBOL, an institution that since 2016 has been working tirelessly to make transparent, professionalise and develop South American football.""
