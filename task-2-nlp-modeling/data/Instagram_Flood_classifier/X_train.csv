385,"🌊Flash Flood!

Las inundaciones relámpago o “Flash flood” (como se conocen en muchos países incluso de habla no inglesa) son inundaciones que ocurren poco después de una lluvia muy intensa en la cuenca de un río, rambla o torrente, lo cual significa que el gran aumento de caudal tiene efecto casi inmediatamente después de esa lluvia muy intensa.

Este fenómeno ha ocurrido esta tarde en Palacios sobre las 15:00h cuando tras una intensa tormenta de rayos, granizo y lluvia se han desbordado alcantarillas y se han levantado las tapas de las arquetas en muchos sitios del pueblo. 

Tan pronto como ha ocurrido la descarga de lluvia, se han cubierto varias calles de agua y a los pocos minutos ha vuelto a bajar el nivel e incluso ha terminado el día soleado de 18:00h de la tarde hasta la puesta de Sol sobre las 22:00 de la noche.

Llevamos una semana de sol y tormentas de verano bastante curiosa.

Las sorprendentes fotografías son de David Munguía (davidmunguia7 ) ¡Muchas gracias por hacerlas porque al poco ya no quedaba agua! 🤗

Incessant rain results in multiple landslides & flash floods in districts of Manang & Sindhupalchowk. 

Seven bodies were recovered today by the Nepali Army from Sindhupalchwok. Rescue & search operations continue for dozens missing in the affected areas. 

As the second wave of #COVID_19 continue to hit the rural areas, the early monsoon flash floods have added to the distress.

497,"Just after a heavy thunderstorm in Zion national park.

It was a normal, warm an sunny September day. Suddenly darker clouds started to form and within a short time a heavy thunderstorm came down on us. Luckily we had already fled to the car since the water masses that came down were immense. 
Since the dry desert soil can't take up much water, waterfalls formed all over the flanks of the Zion Valley. Even the streets transformed into streams. It was definitely an experience and we were even rewarded with a double rainbow at the end. 
Anyway, this image was taken about 1-2 hours after. This normally is a small calm creek that you can easily walk through.

539,"Over the past few days, rainfall in different parts of the park has resulted in flashfloods in several drainages including Terlingua and Tornillo Creek. 

And it appears we could be in for more! The National Weather Service is forecasting a decent chance of thunderstorms for the coming week. 
This photo was taken at the bridge that crosses Tornillo Creek on the road to Rio Grande Village. This normally dry wash was roaring with water after only 1 inch of rainfall. 

Dirt roads, as well as paved roads that cross low drainages, can become impassable after seemingly insignificant amounts of rain. Narrow canyons can quickly flood with water and trap unsuspecting hikers. When visiting the park this time of year, it is important to pay attention to the weather and be prepared to change your plans if storms are in the area. 
Just because it's not raining on your head doesn't mean it isn't raining somewhere upstream from you!

540,"*sound down!*
Mesmerizing, isn’t it? But very dangerous. This amount of water can easily knock someone off their feet, or float a car off the road. It only takes 6” of flowing water to sweep a car off the pavement.

HQ Staffer Jamie Verzwyvelt took this slo-motion video after the storm at Devil’s Waterhole

The park received around 2 inches of rain in about an hour!

Many low-lying sections of trails may be underwater, and the rocks are very slippery when wet, so today may be more of a relax-at-camp day, than exploring the hiking trails.

International research team have concluded that increases in extreme rainfall and associated flooding are projected to continue as global temperatures continue to rise. Efforts to limit warming to +1.5C will help limit changes in extreme rainfall, though some societal adaptations will still be required.

They found that in small and in urban catchments in many parts of the world extreme rainfall has increased the chance of floods occurring and their magnitude, severely impacting local populations and infrastructure. In larger, rural catchments floods depend on many different factors and flooding is less directly linked with extreme rainfall events.

The study shows that human activity has an impact on increases in extreme daily rainfall, increasing the likelihood of some significant events.

The findings show that the risk of flash flooding on urban areas has likely increased in recent decades, due to the expanding impermeable landscape increasing surface runoff, and increased extreme rainfall, while increases are projected to continue

newsroomgy

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) is re-emphasizing the responsibility of Neighbourhood Democratic Councils, Community Development Councils, Village Councils and Regional Democratic Councils in conducting assessments and reporting and providing support to residents affected by floods and other natural hazards.

Continuous flooding in communities across Guyana has reinforced the need for these bodies to utilise the training and plans provided by the CDC over the years.

The CDC, with support from the UNDP and IDB was able to improve the National Disaster Risk Management System (DRM) which has the Regional Disaster Risk Management Systems as critical components. This allowed each region to develop its own DRM system in keeping with the wider national mechanism. Plans and systems have been developed and implemented in all ten administrative regions.

You don't know how bad it is going to get and yet you are already watching houses crack and fall around you. Life isn't ever easy in Haiti made only harder in the last year or so. Once the water levels begin to drop houses will need to be rebuilt, medical care will need to be given and the damage to crops will need to be assessed. They already have so little. Yet what they have is taken. We who have so much can help to change this.

During a telephone interview with the News Room on Thursday, Regional Chairman, Bryan Allicock, said that the water level has not subsided but would fluctuate; the flooding is also exacerbated by the water flowing from the Amazon River in Brazil and the recent heavy rainfall.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts. Some re-strengthening is expected by late today, and #Claudette is expected to become a #tropicalstorm again on Monday over eastern #NorthCarolina. Further strengthening is possible over the western #AtlanticOcean through early Tuesday, then become a post-#tropicalcyclone by late Tuesday.

Claudette is expected to produce additional #rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches across #Alabama, the #FloridaPanhandle, northern and central #Georgia, and Upstate #SouthCarolina through the morning hours. As the system tracks north and east, bands of #heavyrain will occur across portions of central and southern Georgia, central and coastal South Carolina into eastern North Carolina through Monday morning resulting in rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Considerable flash, urban and small stream #flooding impacts, as well as new and renewed minor to isolated moderate river flooding are possible across these areas. 

The combination of #stormsurge and the #tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.

1295,"More than 96,000 hectares of agricultural land has been inundated in eastern India due to a powerful storm this week, a year after a super cyclone ravaged the coastal region.

Cyclone Yaas swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday, triggering storm surges that broke through embankments in West Bengal state, mainly hitting the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans delta that stretches into neighbouring Bangladesh.

The storm has left more than 150,000 people homeless in eastern India and Bangladesh.
With climate change pushing up sea surface temperatures, the cyclonic storms that barrel in from the Bay of Bengal have become more aggressive and frequent, particularly in the last decade, according to researchers.

300 homes had to be evacuated overnight in the province of Canterbury in the country's South Island as this area seems to be the worst hit.

Authorities declared a state of emergency after some places received as much as 40 centimetres (16 inches) of rain over the weekend and on May 31.

The military helped evacuate more than 50 people including several who were airlifted to safety by helicopter.

1326,"One hundred years ago today, one of the most tragic natural disasters to strike Colorado occurred in Pueblo when massive floods destroyed much of the town.

On Friday, June 3rd, 1921, a cloud burst brought torrential rain that swept down the Arkansas River damaging much of the town. The next day more rain came with an even bigger surge that put parts of Pueblo under 17 feet of water. By Sunday, the dam and levee on Beaver Creek, near Florence, burst causing a third surge of water through the town.

Official deaths were counted in the 100-200 person range, but it is estimated that 1500 people perished, as many disappeared, likely swept away and buried by the flood waters and mud. 

One of the hardest hit areas was near the Pueblo Union Station, where the railyards were left in a tangled mess. At the time of one of the surges, a few trains were loaded with passengers as the cars were swept downstream. There are debates in the newspapers from the time, if passengers were able to escape or not. And, if they escaped the car, were they just swept downstream to their deaths. 

Compounding the flood waters, several fires broke out. A lumber yard caught fire, and burning wood was swept downstream which caused fires to many other buildings and homes. The fire department could not help due to the height of the flood.

A year later, it was estimated the floods caused over $20 million in damages ($300 million in todays dollars). A few newspapers compared the destruction of Pueblo to the destruction of San Francisco from the earthquake of 1906.

Rivers on the southern and western plains overflowed, inundating low-lying areas and forcing thousands into relief centers. Illegal filling of low-lying lands reserved for stormwater retention is said to have made the flooding worse.

Sri Lanka ranked 6th among the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2018, in the Global Climate Risk Index. This index analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.)

Each year, the storms seem to get worse, but each year we seem to forget. When rivers run over, swollen by deluges of rain and flash floods affect hundreds of communities - what is our contingency and mitigation plan?

✍🏽 When will ambitious climate policies be drafted? 

⏳  And when will we start holding relevant authorities accountable for their inaction and lack of planning?"

1421,"Have you heard about the Gossamer effect? It’s a survival instinct used by many ground living spiders in response to floods and intense rainfall.

After the recent rain and storms around Victoria, millions of spiders have spun their webs over large parts of Gippsland along the South Gippsland Highway.

The phenomenon looks amazing and scary at the same time. The webs will most likely blow away in the wind but I would hate to be anywhere near there right now.

Grasslands at Gippsland, Victoria in Australia, are covered with cobwebs after severe floods hit the area. The nets are spun by the sheet web spiders who couldn't live on the ground anymore and moved to the higher areas after flooding. The phenomenon is known as ballooning and is very common after flooding, according to ecologists.

It is often women and adolescent girls who share the responsibilities, liabilities, bundles of stress across the three phases of floods - pre, during and post. The multiple roles played and shared by both are simply inconceivable. They are the experts, educators, managers and survivors of a disastrous phenomenon on an annual basis. Come July, and the northern part of Bihar will witness flooding across topologies. Hence, the perfect definition and example of #courage

In the words of Abdullah,

""The direction of the monsoon has changed – it now advances west instead of north across the country. In the northwest, the monsoon failed entirely in 2006, causing severe drought, and 2007 saw a tornado occur months out of season.""

In short, LPWAN stands for low-power, wide-area network.

It is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long-range communication at a low bit rate among connected objects, such as sensors -- just like ours!

This was a memorable day for 8 year old Lucas and mum Kayla from Moree, who was fitted with his first hearing aids through HAPEE and the Tamworth Hearing Centre in New South Wales. Lucas is happier at school and can hear his teacher better than ever. Some of the other students have even said they wished they had hearing aids just like Lucas!

To any young people that are going to be fitted with hearing aids and are feeling a bit scared, Lucas says ""It's not that scary and the hearing aids make everything better to hear."" It only took Lucas 10 minutes to learn how to put his hearing aids on himself, and without a mirror – thanks for being a hearing superstar, Lucas!"

With the recent price increase of cryptocurrencies, scammers are always looking to do a quick buck, and they have been successful in Spain. One of the biggest scams reported is the one associated with a company named Algorithms Group, which scammed more than 280 million euros from 300+ investors.

The brain behind this scam is a man called Javier Biosca, who acted as a broker buying and selling cryptocurrencies and offering weekly interests of 25% per investment. However, the business went sour quickly and Biosca disappeared with the money of investors. Emilia Zaballos, the lawyer that is representing private investors, states the scam could have affected 4,000 people.

🌻We picked wild flowers and Rach placed them in a beautiful display with Dolly, wrapped in her favourite blankets. One of which an old dressing gown she loved to snuggle on. We took paw prints. Trial and error to get this right. It came right. 

🌈Of course with Mercury in Retrograde and satnav sending us to the completely wrong place. Signal blackout. Floods. Diversions. Asda trucks blocking the road. It was as if she was making out last journey together one of adventure and more time together. 

Losing 2 of my family within 2 weeks is not easy. 

💜My home is full of empty bowls and empty beds. It feels as though someone has stopped the story telling before the ending was chosen, and we are left with an emptiness of being unknown within. To add further stress the delivery of her supplements today. 

Time. 
Love.
Grieving.
Peace.

A shit load of tissues. Buckets of tea. 
And our friends. 

✨Herbert was a shocking loss. Dolly in her age and health is not so shocking but still so painful. I’ve been carrying, holding, nursing, grooming and hand feeding her for weeks. There is a hole. And I will not fill it for the sake of it but hold that space in love. In memory.

In gratitude and honour.

President Dr Irfaan Ali on Wednesday announced that the Civil Defence Commission (CDC) has advised that the flood situation across the country is now a Level 2 Disaster.

The Head of State made this disclosure as he addressed residents of Chesney New Housing Scheme during the second day of his outreach activities in regions Five and Six.

“The CDC advised this morning that the disaster is a Level 2 Disaster so that we can now move the situation to the international community to get international support.”

492,"My partner Pat and I went for a walk last evening, in our shorts, sandals and tshirts. Out of no where it started pouring - HEAVY. Like flash flood, hurricane-esque heavy. ⁣
⁣
At first we were like “Ahhh how do we get out of this?” We considered hiding underneath a tree 🌳😅 but instead decided to keeping walking and just embrace it. ⁣
⁣
As soon as we accepted the situation, it became a party. We couldn’t stop laughing. The sky was pink and misty, and there was a bright rainbow that looked more like a mystical laser beam (Can you peep it in this picture?). I danced and splashed in the water like a kid. ⁣
⁣
From inside my house, I know I would’ve been like “Wow, good thing I’m not out in this”. But being in the midst of the storm, totally embracing the situation, I was happier than I could’ve ever been looking through my window. 🌧⁣
⁣
This is a reminder that on the other side of uncomfy feelings, we can find joy and freedom. Unconditional acceptance of the moment allows us to drop judgment and be fully present. If I ran to “take cover” and protect myself, I would’ve never had this magical moment with my partner!⁣
⁣
Life is for dancing, & for doing things that make your heart sing. What’s one situation that you could bring a little more acceptance into, in order to feel joy? ✨⁣"

Our experts proved that the mudslides were actually caused by a recent wildfire deforesting the surrounding hills - meaning the damage was covered after all. Our work allowed Casa Dorinda to receive the settlement they deserved.

570,"100 years ago today there was a flood in my hometown of Pueblo, CO. It destroyed the town and you can still see high water marks on some of the buildings still standing today.

My first report in 3rd grade was all about the Pueblo flood of 1921. I remember researching and reading through some picture books at the library. One of the books said that after the flood people began to use motorized vehicles and horses were no longer used. 

I took that to mean that horses went extinct...

So yesterday and today my Dad reminded me of this monumental occasion 🤣🤣🤣🤣

They are NOT re-flooding the streets and horses can still be found 🤣

313,"World day to combat desertification and drought. 

Here in the UK we might not be facing a desert but with the combination of an increased population and climate change water companies throughout the UK are predicting a deficit of water in the coming 25 years.*

Below are some water saving suggestions. 

1. If you are lucky enough to have a garden, don’t use the sprinkler, half and hour of sprinkler use is equivalent to the water use of an average family of 4 in a day. 

2. Reducing your shower time by one minute will save 10 litres of water per wash. 

3. Running a tap can use 6 litres of water a minute - turn it off if you are not using it. 

4. If you have a dual flush loo, using the smaller flush were you can will save 2 litres per flush

5. Change to using water saving products such as a shampoo bar !

* Thames water predicts a deficit of 350 million lites of water a day by 2045 if no action is taken.

Discuss the risks vs cost with your agent. Make sure you have an agent you know, like & trust!"

1170,"A few weeks ago I had the honour of speaking at the Warrington Speaks Out On Climate event, where I spoke about flooding and the impacts of the climate crisis on the youth. Both things that are incredibly important, especially with the recent flooding we have faced here in the North. I also spoke about privilege and how the government and politicians need to take action. At the end of the event we had two Warrington MP's speak and unsurprisingly they were both disappointing. One said many words without really offering anything other than empty promises and the other made the crisis the responsibility of the general public to fix. I am a strong believer in individual action but me walking more is not going to solve the crisis. The Government taking strong and immediate action could. For reasons I spoke about in my speech I have a level of privilege when it comes to the climate crisis and climate action and therefore I feel I have a duty to take action. But at the same time, I am a teenage student that should not have to spend time writing speeches and organising and attending protests and events to highlight the importance of and demand climate action. The evidence has been there for years, the science has been there for years, the means to solve it has been there for years, but sadly so has our incompetent Governments. I've said it before and I will continue to say it until the people of this planet and this country get what we deserve. We need and deserve climate action. Young people deserve a future. World leaders must do better.

Thank you so much to ceewarrington for having me speak!

The year 2020 witnessed the Amphan storm which resulted in major losses in agriculture as well as fisheries and yet again this year's Yass has lead to further losses including devastation of multiple homes in most of the southern districts of Bengal.

These cyclonic storms are but common in these areas , people here experience these almost every year like Aila (2009),Bulbul (2019),etc.

The affects of such storms bring about major changes in the macroenvironments of marine organisms including fishes and thus are directly or indirectly related to their behavioral issues most importantly breeding & mobility .

Climatological studies state the increasing number of storms is due to rising water temperatures that also affect the fish health. It also tends to intensify the cyclonic storms thus increasing risks for the lives of peeople in these regions.

During a typical season, you can expect sudden down pours, wicked lightning,  and a cooler temperature to come visit the courthouse! Last year we had one of the driest seasons on record with only 1.62 inches. So you tell us, yay or nay for monsoon kicking off?

294,"Finally, Something Positive For The Wildlife In The NW U.S! 

Many species have been under attack, literally, in western State's like Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. But Washington is stepping up and trying to protect their wildlife! Two Spokane-city lawmakers are advocating for a statewide ban on wildlife feeding to help protect the black bears in the State. 

Most of Washington state is currently under a drought advisory, with March and April being the fourth driest period on record for the state since 1895. Kile Westerman, a wildlife conflict specialist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said, they believe as a result from this, the food source available to the bears is ""less than ideal"" which means the bears have to go searching farther and are getting into more urban areas. While feeding bears is illegal, feeding deer and other wildlife is allowed in most of Washington. But bears will be bears, and when food is scarce they are opportunistic. As we know, this puts a target on the bears.

Councilwomen Lori Kinnear and Candace Mumm are planning to add a statewide wildlife feeding ban to the city's Washington State Legislative wish list. When the Legislature starts its 2022 session, Spokane's representative will advocate for some sort of wildlife feeding ban. This will eliminate many areas of concern, including human-bear conflict, the spread of chronic waste disease and the habituation of wild animals.

Every year 5th June is celebrated as World Environment day, which emphasizes the importance of environment conservation. This year's theme for world environment day is ""Ecosystem Restoration"". It can be achieved in many ways like protecting rare species & animals, planting trees, cleaning the rivers, controlling the pollution, and so on.
We all know the importance of the environment in our life. In the last few centuries, the rapid increase in pollution and the decline in ecosystem and biodiversity have disturbed the balance of nature and led to disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and epidemics. Let's stop harming nature and make planet Earth a healthier, greener, and happier place to live.

291,"NEWS RELEASE: Wax proves key to protecting crops from #drought and #frost
usask researchers used the CLS to show that cuticular wax—a waxy layer that covers exterior surfaces of plants, much like human skin—provides a barrier against low temperatures and dehydration.
The ultimate goal of the research is to provide plant breeders with information that enables them to more efficiently select superior #genetic lines and develop more resilient #crops as environmental conditions get more unpredictable, according to Dr. Karen Tanino agbiousask.
The team used our #MidIR beamline to study plant leaves to the depth of two microns (two millionths of a meter), which provided information on the quantity and quality of the surface wax. In a recently published paper, the team argues that the best way to keep #plants from freezing is by selecting waxy varieties. 

This research was funded by nserc_crsng, skgov, and #SaskWheat.

Image: Using infrared thermography, the team could visualize heat stress in the plants.

379,"The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought is observed by United Nations and celebrated each year on 17 June. Its purpose is to raise awareness of the presence of desertification and drought, highlighting methods of preventing desertification and recovering from drought. Each year's global celebration has a unique, novel emphasis that had not been developed previously.This day was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on January 30, 1995, after the day when United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is drafted. This year's theme is ""Restoration, land and recovery. We build back better with healthy land."" Salanization and desertification of land is happening in India like in Punjab due to over use of water as the excess water tends to bring out the natural salts in the soil to come out to form a layer of salt which prevents the plants grow this making the land barren. Desertification also happens due to excessive deforestation which reduces the humus of the soil and thus leads to decreased fertility of the soil. Agro forestry is the best solution to counter desertification and to protect quality of the soil.

793,"Today in Labor History May 31, 1889: The Johnstown Flood. 2,209 people died when a dam holding back a private resort lake burst upstream from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. It was the deadliest U.S. disaster to date. Bodies were found as far away as Cincinnati. It caused $17 million of damage (about $490 million in 2020 dollars).

Wealthy industrialists, like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick owned and patronized the resort. They had built cottages and a clubhouse and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive and private mountain retreat. They had also lowered the dam to build a road across it and installed a fish screen in the spillway that tended to trap debris. Investigators believe these alterations contributed to the disaster. Yet none of the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club were found guilty of any crimes. Furthermore, survivors repeatedly lost court cases in their attempts to recover damages due to the club members’ wealth and expensive legal team. However, public outrage did prompt changes in American law leading to one of strict liability in future cases.

Communities are affected by severe floods that alter their daily lives, livelihoods and property.""

Over the last year North Korea’s main agricultural has been badly affected by extreme weather conditions.Hurricane,drought & flood caused massive grain destruction,disrupting the whole agriculture system.
The closing down of borders during the pandemic was also one of the major factors’. The prevention of exports & imports of food items,fertilisers,agriculture & machinery goods led to scarcity & shortages.
According to World Food Programme & North Korea the population is starving to death. Around 3.5 million died in four years time due to economic & environmental disaster -series of droughts, cyclones ,tropical storms, famine & lack of international support from the traditional allies, specifically Russia.

Sunday, June 6, 2021

• Current water levels are down from where they were at this time of the year in 2020, 2019 or even 2018, but are still well above average.

• There is a risk of flooding and shoreline damage along the shorelines of Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair

• Sustained wind speeds above moderate can create waves that cause flooding, erosion, and shoreline damage.

• Risk of erosion and damage to shoreline protection works, including erosion along the high bluffs.

and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.""-Hebrews 9:9-17

330,"The government of #Chile and the National Geographic Society are going to new heights in a search for answers about the 11-year #drought plaguing the central part of the country. With the Ministry of #Agriculture declaring emergencies in over 50 municipalities, the toll is clear, yet the meteorological factors behind the megadrought remain shrouded in mystery. 

So with a little help from luxury watchmaker rolex, insidenatgeo teamed up with Chile’s Ministry of Public Works on a mission to install a weather station on the highest mountain in the #Andes: the dormant Tupungato Volcano. 

Based on their experience launching similar projects on Mount Everest, the team knew the #weather station had to be durable enough to withstand high winds, but light enough to be carried up the mountain and assembled on site. Deep snow and pandemic protocols presented logistical challenges, but the team pulled it off.

Now it’s all about collecting #data—getting near-real-time reads on temperature, humidity, moisture, barometric pressure and solar radiation. As it’s collected, data will be transmitted to monitoring facilities, with researchers and Chilean officials aiming to collect data over multiple seasons to understand how glaciers and the snow in water towers like Tupungato respond to #climatechange. And that info, in turn, will help improve forecasting models.

The ultimate goal? “Support and elevate solutions that can help restore balance to our ecosystems,” said Nicole Alexiev, vice president, #science and #innovation, National Geographic Society.

317,"Look up this week’s episode of HBO’s Bill Maher show.  This segment was on the state of water in California, big ag, and almonds!  Almond farming takes 80% of the potable water in California, and supplies about the same percentage of the world’s almond supply. However, almonds ARE grown in other places that HAVE adequate rainfall.

Residents are getting restrictions while almond farming mega corporations, along with Nestle and Coke are stealing the water that is owned by the residents of California, putting it in plastic bottles and selling it back to the residents at an incredible profit. 

Look how much water it takes to grow a pound of strawberries as compared to a pound of almonds.

California is burning while almond growers are continuing to get rich, rape the land, and use tons of pesticides in the process.

Maher says if Coal miners are being forced to retrain into other jobs that won’t kill people, so can almond farmers be. 

I agree. 

I haven’t bought almonds in years, but I admit to buying almond butter whenever I see it on sale.  It is anti-inflammatory, and a main ingredient in some of my best selling fermented snacks, but I will no longer buy it from California.  There are other things that are anti-inflammatory and don’t take such a heavy toll on the the ecosystem.

KNOW BETTER. DO BETTER.

1199,"This month marks the ten-year anniversary of the 2011 Las Conchas Fire, which burned 156,000 acres of the Jemez Mountains. At the time, Las Conchas was the largest fire in New Mexico’s recorded history. 

Here in New Mexico—and across the West—wildfire season is getting longer. Wildfires, bigger. And these trends will continue in our warming world. Between 1970 and 2020, New Mexico’s average annual temperature has risen by 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit—and forecasts show we’re in for more and more warming into the future. 

But wildfires aren’t the only problem spurred by rising temperatures and drought, which have even more impacts on our forests, including insect infestations. 

On this month’s episode of Our Land, we look at how climate change is altering New Mexico’s forests. And what the future holds. 

Guests: 
Laura McCarthy, New Mexico State Forester 
Daniel Denipah, Forestry Director, Pueblo of Santa Clara 
Chad Brown, Forest Development & Restoration Manager, Pueblo of Santa Clara 
Lindsey Quam, Deputy Director of Forests, New Mexico Forestry Division

726,"After #Warpaint filled our ears in 2010 with their acclaimed debut The Fool, they were been honing their sound on the road before escaping to The Joshua Tree to record their 2014 eponymous second, co-produced by the band and #Flood (PJ Harvey, New Order, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds) and mixed by Flood and #NigelGodrich. Artist and director #ChrisCunningham also worked closely with the band to create artwork for the album, as well as a forthcoming documentary - nutsack monster was not included.
Alongside single Love Is To Die, Warpaint bring beefed up electronics to their tracks to sculpt their woozy #shoegaze into something sinisterly sexy. ""I don't know if this is TMI or something,"" Wayman told the Guide, ""but if you really fall into music while you're playing, it's the same space as when you are with a lover. You can see guitar players in the way that they're playing that they're in some ecstatic moment and it could equally be a sexual moment where they're alone with someone. So if I were to actually put it all into a pot and think about it, playing music can take you closer to that same kind of state of ecstacy as an orgasm. Sometimes that can be very alarming if you're onstage."""

This horror stories of people who survived and the hardships dey faced made me indulge into the disaster studies and following year I enrolled for PG program in Disaster Management. 

Disasters dont impact people for a short time, but its the long lasting effects which actually cripple the society at large. Let's pledge to make this world a better place, let's equip ourselves wd basics of disaster & emergency preparedness, let's make a safe & resilient world !

285,"Dangerously hot temperatures gripping parts of the Western U.S. will continue to smash records as the week comes to a close.

🔥 A large dome of high pressure in the upper atmosphere has developed over the West.
Beneath the dome, sinking air is causing temperatures to soar well over 100 degrees in many areas.
Heat alerts have been issued by the National Weather Service for various time periods this week, from parts of the Southwest into the Great Basin and California.

🚩 Records have already been broken in this heat wave and more are likely to fall in the days ahead, from the Central Rockies into the Desert Southwest and California.
Salt Lake City tied its all-time record high for any day of the year yesterday when it hit 107 degrees.
That followed daily record highs on Sunday (102 degrees) and Monday (103 degrees).
Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Sacramento are some of the cities that could set at least daily record highs through late this week.

⚠️ Outdoor activities should be limited in these areas because of the possibility of heat-related illnesses.
The core of the heat will be most persistent in the Southwest, but it will also affect parts of the Great Basin and Rockies.
It will spread into California's central valley for the end of the week.
Wildfire concerns will also be elevated this week because of the hot temperatures in combination with long-term drought conditions in place across a large part of the West.

He decided to do a dedication for the victims of Hurricane Matthew. After seeing my picture on the news he finished and entered it into scholastic yesterday. He spent all night searching for me on the Internet and found me this morning to inform me of what he did. I think this is super dope painting but that's just me. 🙌🏾 Best of luck to you Nick - ImSoFIRST
