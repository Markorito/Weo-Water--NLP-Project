Areas of Helambu & Melamchi in central Nepal's Sindhupalchok District has been inundated by flash floods and multiple landslides. 

Thousands of families have been displaced, search for the missing continues,

“You got water receding and soon as that happens, the rainfall and situation is bad again. You had heavy rainfall over the last 42-hours and then this morning so the water is building up there.

But in the first pic, you can see wayyyy down there where the dock is—that’s where the water line typically is. 😳 As far as I know, everyone around us is safe, and stuff can be replaced, so we’re taking it in stride and viewing it as an educational experience and part of the journey!

1386,"It is certainly tempting to grab an all-purpose cleaner and a roll of paper towels when you spot mold in your home or office. You must resist this temptation! Skip the DIY cleaning attempt and lean on the experts for a thorough and safe mold removal.

Here are four examples of why you shouldn't handle mold removal yourself: 
1. You might not properly assess the damage
2. Mold might return.
3. It's expensive to remove by yourself.
4. You put your health at risk.

Instead, of going the DIY route, when you need a mold remediation service, we are just a call away at (925) 299-1323. We have a team of professionals who will take care of it and ensure the problem doesn't return!

1247,"“It’s just stuff & you can’t take it with you.” - Me 

At the end of March, we basically had a flood upstairs that overflowed into the downstairs. 

Last weekend, the ceiling in the kitchen revealed a leak from the other bathroom upstairs. 

Yesterday, I filed a third insurance claim because my roof has severe damage and needs to be replaced. 

Over the last 4 years, as I’ve remodeled, invested, and made this house my dream home, I’ve told myself over and over again, “It’s just stuff & you can’t take it with you.” My goal has been to keep my heart appropriately detached from these earthy things. I asked myself, “Lauren, what if you lost it all? What if you had to sell it all? What if…” 

By God’s grace, I think I’ve endured enough suffering at this point in life to know my priorities. Therefore, when all of this went down, I lost my junk for a short bit like any normal human would, but I quickly went back to that place in my heart & mind I’d carefully kept about my home. 

My plants are happily placed in my #wetroom , the dog is at the trainer’s, the kids are with their dad, and I packed allll of my necessities into my van. 

They’ll be repairing everything over the next 2-3 weeks, and, though I may grow weary of it all, I’m sure, for now, I’m open-handed, light-hearted, and peace-minded. Praise Jesus. 

Also, happy Father’s Day to my amazing dad who was my first-responder the night it all began. He’s also the person who’s taught me to have less stuff and live more life. I love him for that and more! 💙💙💙"

143,"Day 708: World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. Global warming doesn't just affect the coldest parts of the planet, but some of the hottest and driest ones as well.
.
Desertification and land degradation, caused primarily from mining, urbanization, and agriculture, are only worsened by global warming. Especially in dryland areas where agriculture or other land uses are hard on the soil, the ground quickly snowballs to a desert-like state. If plants aren't able to keep the soil together, the soil can degrade further, allowing even less plant life to take hold.
.
It's a slippery situation that could end up affecting hundreds of millions of people. Currently, there are 2 billion people that live in dryland areas that could eventually be at risk of being displaced by desertification. But even by the end of this next decade, 50 million people around the world could be displaced by desertification.
.
Just like with the Paris Climate Agreement, the Convention to Combat Desertification involves 122 countries that have committed to keeping soil arable and managing freshwater supplies. One initiative, the Great Green Wall, aims to restore over 380,000 square miles of African soil by 2030. Another initiative in the Gobi Desert includes planting trees in northern China to stop the desert's spread.

365,"DOZENS OF ORLAND WELLS HAVE ALREADY DRIED UP

It is almost June, but dozens of wells in Orland are already dried up, leaving many without water.💦

ORLAND, Calif. - Many across Orland are asking one thing: where’s the water?
For one long-time farming family, they haven’t seen water levels this low in years.

👉“Our tank is empty,” Staci Buttermore said. “Absolutely done. We are now hauling water.”
But they are not alone.
Dozens in the area are experiencing the same problem: little to no water.
And many of them are afraid to even turn on their pumps, worrying they might burn them out.
As a result, many people are grabbing water from others, but they don’t know when that will run out either.
This means no water for showers, no water to drink, but most importantly, no water for the animals and the crop.
Besides being in a drought, Action News Now asked the Buttermore family about why they think this happened this year.📰
“It just really caught up with us,” Kassidi Buttermore explained. “We didn’t have anything in the reservoirs, and we haven’t had good recharge for the ground water for each individual piece of property. It was a perfect storm in a way.”😳
And farmers are just hoping to bring more attention to a bigger issue.
“I hope people don’t just think everybody is out for their own pocketbook,” Staci said. “People need to come to the table like adults. We need to have people tell both sides of the story but this state needs storage. I think there are ways parties can come together and keep our state sustainable and hopefully not a dust bowl.”
Well companies are saying they can’t come out to drill for months, leaving many not knowing when they will get water again.
🚜Farmers were also saying they are worried the lower levels of water will drive the cost of food up and bring employment in the agriculture industry down.

Locals and climate experts believe global warming is responsible, as the mild weather melts the sea ice which once protected the shores of Oktyabrskiy from strong autumn and winter storms.

माता भूमि: पुत्रोsहं पृथिव्या: (अथर्ववेद)
""KalpVriksha"" ~ or #treeoflife has a philosophical concept in Mithila Art form. It gives life to all the animals, birds , reptiles & plants. It is deeply rooted into the earth(soil) and thus supports the life benith. 
With the advent of massive urbanization we are just cutting trees for the sake of skyscrapers and industries. Our earth is left with tall buildings, advanced technology but without life !! We have gifted our earth with the gift of #Deforestation & adverse effects of #globalwarming ! 
Regular #Floods , the affected marine life & excessive heat  are some of the consequences. .
My Canvas Painting #Vipalava depicts Under water life, animal - plant kingdom ,  Modern World, infrastructure & its consequences.
Its  a #contemporary Mithila Painting where I have tried to depict the complete idea in the #FolkArt form !!

In fact flows are lower now than they were in 2014 when the river disconnected in the fall and left migrating Chinook suffering from elevated levels of disease. This is why we asked the Humboldt County Supervisors last week to take immediate action and pass an emergency ordinance which would allow them to curtail groundwater pumping to preserve surface flows.

The upper Arroyo Seco in Pasadena was beautiful with little graffiti and zero homeless camps. As soon as you get into LA County it becomes a big mess with homeless camps on both sides at various locations. We saw lots of wood-burning fires at these homeless camps along our route. It literally looks like good old-fashioned camping.

5,"Did you know that people with Down syndrome tend to have itty bitty passages in their bodies?

For example, Finn has teeny tiny ear canals, so tiny that no doctor has ever been able to see inside! Because his ear canals are so small, he uses a BAHA (bone-anchored hearing aid) to help the sound travel to his inner ear so he can hear normally.

Finn has teeny tiny tear ducts, so tiny that even after surgery in December, they are still not draining his tears properly. This is why you often see tears in his eyes or running down his cheeks even when he's not crying.

Finny will be getting surgery at the end of July because of these itty bitty passages. He'll be getting stints in his tear ducts to help his eyes drain properly. He'll also have a doctor look into his ears while he's sedated. They'll be checking for fluid and to make sure there is nothing structural obstructing his hearing. We're also hoping to get some scar tissue removed from his g-tube site. Thankfully, Finn does great during surgery and we have no doubt he will again.

[Image description: A toddler boy with tan skin, dark curly hair, and Down syndrome sits on an exam table in a doctor's office. His hands are up in the air excitedly. He is wearing a lime green tie-dye t-shirt, khaki shorts, dark blue tennis shoes, and a blue BAHA.]"

This will prevent road water from spilling into your yard. Have a battery backup in case the power goes out. Also, it is good to install a sump pump in your basement and crawlspace.
