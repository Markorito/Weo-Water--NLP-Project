385,flood,"üåäFlash Flood!

Las inundaciones rel√°mpago o ‚ÄúFlash flood‚Äù (como se conocen en muchos pa√≠ses incluso de habla no inglesa) son inundaciones que ocurren poco despu√©s de una lluvia muy intensa en la cuenca de un r√≠o, rambla o torrente, lo cual significa que el gran aumento de caudal tiene efecto casi inmediatamente despu√©s de esa lluvia muy intensa.

Este fen√≥meno ha ocurrido esta tarde en Palacios sobre las 15:00h cuando tras una intensa tormenta de rayos, granizo y lluvia se han desbordado alcantarillas y se han levantado las tapas de las arquetas en muchos sitios del pueblo. 

Tan pronto como ha ocurrido la descarga de lluvia, se han cubierto varias calles de agua y a los pocos minutos ha vuelto a bajar el nivel e incluso ha terminado el d√≠a soleado de 18:00h de la tarde hasta la puesta de Sol sobre las 22:00 de la noche.

Llevamos una semana de sol y tormentas de verano bastante curiosa.

Las sorprendentes fotograf√≠as son de David Mungu√≠a (davidmunguia7 ) ¬°Muchas gracias por hacerlas porque al poco ya no quedaba agua! ü§ó

539,flood,"Over the past few days, rainfall in different parts of the park has resulted in flashfloods in several drainages including Terlingua and Tornillo Creek. 

And it appears we could be in for more! The National Weather Service is forecasting a decent chance of thunderstorms for the coming week. 
This photo was taken at the bridge that crosses Tornillo Creek on the road to Rio Grande Village. This normally dry wash was roaring with water after only 1 inch of rainfall. 

Dirt roads, as well as paved roads that cross low drainages, can become impassable after seemingly insignificant amounts of rain. Narrow canyons can quickly flood with water and trap unsuspecting hikers. When visiting the park this time of year, it is important to pay attention to the weather and be prepared to change your plans if storms are in the area. 
Just because it's not raining on your head doesn't mean it isn't raining somewhere upstream from you!

540,flood,"*sound down!*
Mesmerizing, isn‚Äôt it? But very dangerous. This amount of water can easily knock someone off their feet, or float a car off the road. It only takes 6‚Äù of flowing water to sweep a car off the pavement.

HQ Staffer Jamie Verzwyvelt took this slo-motion video after the storm at Devil‚Äôs Waterhole

The park received around 2 inches of rain in about an hour!

Many low-lying sections of trails may be underwater, and the rocks are very slippery when wet, so today may be more of a relax-at-camp day, than exploring the hiking trails.

612,flood,"The amount of moisture picked up by monsoon winds has grown as the ocean's surface has warmed owing to climate change. As a result, climate models predict higher rainfall and thus increasing the risk of flooding. 

As published on the 8th of January, Pahang was hit by monsoon rains where at least six people have died and nearly 50,000 evacuated.

International research team have concluded that increases in¬†extreme rainfall¬†and associated flooding are projected to continue as¬†global temperatures¬†continue to rise. Efforts to limit warming to +1.5C will help limit changes in extreme rainfall, though some societal adaptations will still be required.

They found that in small and in urban catchments in many parts of the world extreme rainfall has increased the chance of floods occurring and their magnitude, severely impacting local populations and infrastructure. In larger, rural catchments floods depend on many different factors and flooding is less directly linked with¬†extreme rainfall events.

The study shows that human activity has an impact on increases in extreme daily rainfall, increasing the likelihood of some significant events.

The findings show that the risk of flash flooding on¬†urban areas¬†has likely increased in recent decades, due to the expanding impermeable landscape increasing surface runoff, and increased extreme rainfall, while increases are projected to continue

""The direction of the monsoon has changed ‚Äì it now advances west instead of north across the country. In the northwest, the monsoon failed entirely in 2006, causing severe drought, and 2007 saw a tornado occur months out of season.""

The #weather department has predicted moderate rain or thundershowers in the country's financial capital and surrounding suburbs, with the possibility of heavy, or very heavy, rain, in some places.

Mumbai's #Colaba observatory recorded 77 mm of rain in a 24-hour period ending 8.30 am. Around 60 mm of rain was recorded in #Santacruz in the same period.

newsroomgy

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) is re-emphasizing the responsibility of Neighbourhood Democratic Councils, Community Development Councils, Village Councils and Regional Democratic Councils in conducting assessments and reporting and providing support to residents affected by floods and other natural hazards.

Continuous flooding in communities across Guyana has reinforced the need for these bodies to utilise the training and plans provided by the CDC over the years.

The CDC, with support from the UNDP and IDB was able to improve the National Disaster Risk Management System (DRM) which has the Regional Disaster Risk Management Systems as critical components. This allowed each region to develop its own DRM system in keeping with the wider national mechanism. Plans and systems have been developed and implemented in all ten administrative regions.

1120,flood,"I remember waking up to flooding in 5th Section, Haiti in 2019. The waters were still rising. It's a scary and very sad situation to be in. You don't know how bad it is going to get and yet you are already watching houses crack and fall around you. Life isn't ever easy in Haiti made only harder in the last year or so. Once the water levels begin to drop houses will need to be rebuilt, medical care will need to be given and the damage to crops will need to be assessed. They already have so little. Yet what they have is taken. We who have so much can help to change this.

Many people have been forced to evacuate their homes and businesses, due to rising water levels and wild species. For example, large Anacondas are found in people's homes and public spaces just outside of Georgetown, Guyana.

The globalpaintforcharity is currently working in partnership with the US Army and other humanitarian organizations to deploy disaster assistance to the victims in #Guyana, #Venezuela, #Honduras, El #Salvador and #Guatemala. 

We hope to soon have additional information, on how best to support the victims in the region. But help is needed, this is a great opportunity to show your support and contributions.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts. Some re-strengthening is expected by late today, and #Claudette is expected to become a #tropicalstorm again on Monday over eastern #NorthCarolina. Further strengthening is possible over the western #AtlanticOcean through early Tuesday, then become a post-#tropicalcyclone by late Tuesday.

Claudette is expected to produce additional #rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches across #Alabama, the #FloridaPanhandle, northern and central #Georgia, and Upstate #SouthCarolina through the morning hours. As the system tracks north and east, bands of #heavyrain will occur across portions of central and southern Georgia, central and coastal South Carolina into eastern North Carolina through Monday morning resulting in rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Considerable flash, urban and small stream #flooding impacts, as well as new and renewed minor to isolated moderate river flooding are possible across these areas. 

The combination of #stormsurge and the #tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.

1295,flood,"More than 96,000 hectares of agricultural land has been inundated in eastern India due to a powerful storm this week, a year after a super cyclone ravaged the coastal region.

Cyclone Yaas swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday, triggering storm surges that broke through embankments in West Bengal state, mainly hitting the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans delta that stretches into neighbouring Bangladesh.

The storm has left more than 150,000 people homeless in eastern India and Bangladesh.
With climate change pushing up sea surface temperatures, the cyclonic storms that barrel in from the Bay of Bengal have become more aggressive and frequent, particularly in the last decade, according to researchers.

Authorities declared a state of emergency after some places received as much as 40 centimetres (16 inches) of rain over the weekend and on May 31.

The military helped evacuate more than 50 people including several who were airlifted to safety by helicopter.

1326,flood,"One hundred years ago today, one of the most tragic natural disasters to strike Colorado occurred in Pueblo when massive floods destroyed much of the town.

On Friday, June 3rd, 1921, a cloud burst brought torrential rain that swept down the Arkansas River damaging much of the town. The next day more rain came with an even bigger surge that put parts of Pueblo under 17 feet of water. By Sunday, the dam and levee on Beaver Creek, near Florence, burst causing a third surge of water through the town.

Official deaths were counted in the 100-200 person range, but it is estimated that 1500 people perished, as many disappeared, likely swept away and buried by the flood waters and mud. 

One of the hardest hit areas was near the Pueblo Union Station, where the railyards were left in a tangled mess. At the time of one of the surges, a few trains were loaded with passengers as the cars were swept downstream. There are debates in the newspapers from the time, if passengers were able to escape or not. And, if they escaped the car, were they just swept downstream to their deaths. 

Compounding the flood waters, several fires broke out. A lumber yard caught fire, and burning wood was swept downstream which caused fires to many other buildings and homes. The fire department could not help due to the height of the flood.

A year later, it was estimated the floods caused over $20 million in damages ($300 million in todays dollars). A few newspapers compared the destruction of Pueblo to the destruction of San Francisco from the earthquake of 1906.

Rivers on the southern and western plains overflowed, inundating low-lying areas and forcing thousands into relief centers. Illegal filling of low-lying lands reserved for stormwater retention is said to have made the flooding worse.

Sri Lanka ranked 6th among the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2018, in the Global Climate Risk Index. This index analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.)

Each year, the storms seem to get worse, but each year we seem to forget. When rivers run over, swollen by deluges of rain and flash floods affect hundreds of communities - what is our contingency and mitigation plan?

Grasslands at Gippsland, Victoria in Australia, are covered with cobwebs after severe floods hit the area. The nets are spun by the sheet web spiders who couldn't live on the ground anymore and moved to the higher areas after flooding. The phenomenon is known as ballooning and is very common after flooding, according to ecologists.

It is often women and adolescent girls who share the responsibilities, liabilities, bundles of stress across the three phases of floods - pre, during and post. The multiple roles played and shared by both are simply inconceivable. They are the experts, educators, managers and survivors of a disastrous phenomenon on an annual basis.

In the words of Abdullah,

""The direction of the monsoon has changed ‚Äì it now advances west instead of north across the country. In the northwest, the monsoon failed entirely in 2006, causing severe drought, and 2007 saw a tornado occur months out of season.""

You may have heard the term LPWAN before, and you may be wondering: what is LPWAN, and what is its role in IoT?
In short, LPWAN stands for low-power, wide-area network.

It is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long-range communication at a low bit rate among connected objects, such as sensors -- just like ours!

To any young people that are going to be fitted with hearing aids and are feeling a bit scared, Lucas says ""It's not that scary and the hearing aids make everything better to hear.""

Here are four examples of why you shouldn't handle mold removal yourself: 
1. You might not properly assess the damage
2. Mold might return.
3. It's expensive to remove by yourself.
4. You put your health at risk.

Instead, of going the DIY route, when you need a mold remediation service, we are just a call away at (925) 299-1323. We have a team of professionals who will take care of it and ensure the problem doesn't return!

With the recent price increase of cryptocurrencies, scammers are always looking to do a quick buck, and they have been successful in Spain. One of the biggest scams reported is the one associated with a company named Algorithms Group, which scammed more than 280 million euros from 300+ investors.

The brain behind this scam is a man called Javier Biosca, who acted as a broker buying and selling cryptocurrencies and offering weekly interests of 25% per investment. However, the business went sour quickly and Biosca disappeared with the money of investors. Emilia Zaballos, the lawyer that is representing private investors, states the scam could have affected 4,000 people.

Showers are impacting northwestern Denver and portions of the central plains, as well as the southern part of the western slope. Temperatures are in the 40s and 50s for the plains, with 30s/40s for the mountains and 50s/60s for the western slope. Showers will increase for south-central Colorado over the next few hours, with some embedded thunderstorms capable of small hail and torrential rainfall. With these showers and thunderstorms comes a burn scar flood risk, and a flash flood watch has been issued for the Sangre de Cristo and Wet mountains until 10 PM tonight.

492,none,"My partner Pat and I went for a walk last evening, in our shorts, sandals and tshirts. Out of no where it started pouring - HEAVY. Like flash flood, hurricane-esque heavy. ‚Å£
‚Å£
At first we were like ‚ÄúAhhh how do we get out of this?‚Äù We considered hiding underneath a tree üå≥üòÖ but instead decided to keeping walking and just embrace it. ‚Å£
‚Å£
As soon as we accepted the situation, it became a party. We couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. The sky was pink and misty, and there was a bright rainbow that looked more like a mystical laser beam (Can you peep it in this picture?). I danced and splashed in the water like a kid. ‚Å£
‚Å£
From inside my house, I know I would‚Äôve been like ‚ÄúWow, good thing I‚Äôm not out in this‚Äù. But being in the midst of the storm, totally embracing the situation, I was happier than I could‚Äôve ever been looking through my window. üåß‚Å£
‚Å£
This is a reminder that on the other side of uncomfy feelings, we can find joy and freedom. Unconditional acceptance of the moment allows us to drop judgment and be fully present. If I ran to ‚Äútake cover‚Äù and protect myself, I would‚Äôve never had this magical moment with my partner!‚Å£
‚Å£
Life is for dancing, & for doing things that make your heart sing. What‚Äôs one situation that you could bring a little more acceptance into, in order to feel joy? ‚ú®‚Å£"

Sometimes we find ourselves outside of our ideal. Our situations be it spiritual, emotional, or physical don‚Äôt measure up to what we once thought was necessary for growth. But, like the cactus, our lives have purpose even when the ground we stand in is lacking some important things.

1247,none,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just stuff & you can‚Äôt take it with you.‚Äù - Me 

At the end of March, we basically had a flood upstairs that overflowed into the downstairs. 

Last weekend, the ceiling in the kitchen revealed a leak from the other bathroom upstairs. 

Yesterday, I filed a third insurance claim because my roof has severe damage and needs to be replaced. 

Over the last 4 years, as I‚Äôve remodeled, invested, and made this house my dream home, I‚Äôve told myself over and over again, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just stuff & you can‚Äôt take it with you.‚Äù My goal has been to keep my heart appropriately detached from these earthy things. I asked myself, ‚ÄúLauren, what if you lost it all? What if you had to sell it all? What if‚Ä¶‚Äù 

By God‚Äôs grace, I think I‚Äôve endured enough suffering at this point in life to know my priorities. Therefore, when all of this went down, I lost my junk for a short bit like any normal human would, but I quickly went back to that place in my heart & mind I‚Äôd carefully kept about my home. 

My plants are happily placed in my #wetroom , the dog is at the trainer‚Äôs, the kids are with their dad, and I packed allll of my necessities into my van. 

They‚Äôll be repairing everything over the next 2-3 weeks, and, though I may grow weary of it all, I‚Äôm sure, for now, I‚Äôm open-handed, light-hearted, and peace-minded. Praise Jesus. 

Also, happy Father‚Äôs Day to my amazing dad who was my first-responder the night it all began. He‚Äôs also the person who‚Äôs taught me to have less stuff and live more life. I love him for that and more! üíôüíôüíô"

Here in the UK we might not be facing a desert but with the combination of an increased population and climate change water companies throughout the UK are predicting a deficit of water in the coming 25 years.*

Below are some water saving suggestions. 

1. If you are lucky enough to have a garden, don‚Äôt use the sprinkler, half and hour of sprinkler use is equivalent to the water use of an average family of 4 in a day. 

2. Reducing your shower time by one minute will save 10 litres of water per wash. 

3. Running a tap can use 6 litres of water a minute - turn it off if you are not using it. 

4. If you have a dual flush loo, using the smaller flush were you can will save 2 litres per flush

5. Change to using water saving products such as a shampoo bar !

* Thames water predicts a deficit of 350 million lites of water a day by 2045 if no action is taken.

143,none,"Day 708: World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. Global warming doesn't just affect the coldest parts of the planet, but some of the hottest and driest ones as well.
.
Desertification and land degradation, caused primarily from mining, urbanization, and agriculture, are only worsened by global warming. Especially in dryland areas where agriculture or other land uses are hard on the soil, the ground quickly snowballs to a desert-like state. If plants aren't able to keep the soil together, the soil can degrade further, allowing even less plant life to take hold.
.
It's a slippery situation that could end up affecting hundreds of millions of people. Currently, there are 2 billion people that live in dryland areas that could eventually be at risk of being displaced by desertification. But even by the end of this next decade, 50 million people around the world could be displaced by desertification.
.
Just like with the Paris Climate Agreement, the Convention to Combat Desertification involves 122 countries that have committed to keeping soil arable and managing freshwater supplies. One initiative, the Great Green Wall, aims to restore over 380,000 square miles of African soil by 2030. Another initiative in the Gobi Desert includes planting trees in northern China to stop the desert's spread.

1170,none,"A few weeks ago I had the honour of speaking at the Warrington Speaks Out On Climate event, where I spoke about flooding and the impacts of the climate crisis on the youth. Both things that are incredibly important, especially with the recent flooding we have faced here in the North. I also spoke about privilege and how the government and politicians need to take action. At the end of the event we had two Warrington MP's speak and unsurprisingly they were both disappointing. One said many words without really offering anything other than empty promises and the other made the crisis the responsibility of the general public to fix. I am a strong believer in individual action but me walking more is not going to solve the crisis. The Government taking strong and immediate action could. For reasons I spoke about in my speech I have a level of privilege when it comes to the climate crisis and climate action and therefore I feel I have a duty to take action. But at the same time, I am a teenage student that should not have to spend time writing speeches and organising and attending protests and events to highlight the importance of and demand climate action. The evidence has been there for years, the science has been there for years, the means to solve it has been there for years, but sadly so has our incompetent Governments. I've said it before and I will continue to say it until the people of this planet and this country get what we deserve. We need and deserve climate action. Young people deserve a future. World leaders must do better.

Thank you so much to ceewarrington for having me speak!

oh and mrandycarter and charlotte2153  please take proper climate action please and thank you

The year 2020 witnessed the Amphan storm which resulted in major losses in agriculture as well as fisheries and yet again this year's Yass has lead to further losses including devastation of multiple homes in most of the southern districts of Bengal.

These cyclonic storms are but common in these areas , people here experience these almost every year like Aila (2009),Bulbul (2019),etc.

The affects of such storms bring about major changes in the macroenvironments of marine organisms including fishes and thus are directly or indirectly related to their behavioral issues most importantly breeding & mobility .

Climatological studies state the increasing number of storms is due to rising water temperatures that also affect the fish health. It also tends to intensify the cyclonic storms thus increasing risks for the lives of peeople in these regions.

It is almost June, but dozens of wells in Orland are already dried up, leaving many without water.üí¶

ORLAND, Calif.¬†- Many across Orland are asking one thing: where‚Äôs the water?
For one long-time farming family, they haven‚Äôt seen water levels this low in years.

üëâ‚ÄúOur tank is empty,‚Äù Staci Buttermore said. ‚ÄúAbsolutely done. We are now hauling water.‚Äù
But they are not alone.
Dozens in the area are experiencing the same problem: little to no water.
And many of them are afraid to even turn on their pumps, worrying they might burn them out.
As a result, many people are grabbing water from others, but they don‚Äôt know when that will run out either.
This means no water for showers, no water to drink, but most importantly, no water for the animals and the crop.
Besides being in a drought, Action News Now asked the Buttermore family about why they think this happened this year.üì∞
‚ÄúIt just really caught up with us,‚Äù Kassidi Buttermore explained. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have anything in the reservoirs, and we haven‚Äôt had good recharge for the ground water for each individual piece of property. It was a perfect storm in a way.‚Äùüò≥
And farmers are just hoping to bring more attention to a bigger issue.
‚ÄúI hope people don‚Äôt just think everybody is out for their own pocketbook,‚Äù Staci said. ‚ÄúPeople need to come to the table like adults. We need to have people tell both sides of the story but this state needs storage. I think there are ways parties can come together and keep our state sustainable and hopefully not a dust bowl.‚Äù
Well companies are saying they can‚Äôt come out to drill for months, leaving many not knowing when they will get water again.
üöúFarmers were also saying they are worried the lower levels of water will drive the cost of food up and bring employment in the agriculture industry down.

Many species have been under attack, literally, in western State's like Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. But Washington is stepping up and trying to protect their wildlife! Two Spokane-city lawmakers are advocating for a statewide ban on wildlife feeding to help protect the black bears in the State. 

Most of Washington state is currently under a drought advisory, with March and April being the fourth driest period on record for the state since 1895. Kile Westerman, a wildlife conflict specialist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said, they believe as a result from this, the food source available to the bears is ""less than ideal"" which means the bears have to go searching farther and are getting into more urban areas. While feeding bears is illegal, feeding deer and other wildlife is allowed in most of Washington. But bears will be bears, and when food is scarce they are opportunistic. As we know, this puts a target on the bears.

Councilwomen Lori Kinnear and Candace Mumm are planning to add a statewide wildlife feeding ban to the city's Washington State Legislative wish list. When the Legislature starts its 2022 session, Spokane's representative will advocate for some sort of wildlife feeding ban. This will eliminate many areas of concern, including human-bear conflict, the spread of chronic waste disease and the habituation of wild animals.

Every year 5th June is celebrated as World Environment day, which emphasizes the importance of environment conservation. This year's theme for world environment day is ""Ecosystem Restoration"". It can be achieved in many ways like protecting rare species & animals, planting trees, cleaning the rivers, controlling the pollution, and so on.
We all know the importance of the environment in our life. In the last few centuries, the rapid increase in pollution and the decline in ecosystem and biodiversity have disturbed the balance of nature and led to disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and epidemics. Let's stop harming nature and make planet Earth a healthier, greener, and happier place to live.

usask researchers used the CLS to show that cuticular wax‚Äîa waxy layer that covers exterior surfaces of plants, much like human skin‚Äîprovides a barrier against low temperatures and dehydration.
The ultimate goal of the research is to provide plant breeders with information that enables them to more efficiently select superior #genetic lines and develop more resilient #crops as environmental conditions get more unpredictable, according to Dr. Karen Tanino agbiousask.
The team used our #MidIR beamline to study plant leaves to the depth of two microns (two millionths of a meter), which provided information on the quantity and quality of the surface wax. In a recently published paper, the team argues that the best way to keep #plants from freezing is by selecting waxy varieties. 

This research was funded by nserc_crsng, skgov, and #SaskWheat.

379,none,"The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought is observed by United Nations and celebrated each year on 17 June. Its purpose is to raise awareness of the presence of desertification and drought, highlighting methods of preventing desertification and recovering from drought. Each year's global celebration has a unique, novel emphasis that had not been developed previously.This day was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on January 30, 1995, after the day when United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is drafted. This year's theme is ""Restoration, land and recovery. We build back better with healthy land."" Salanization and desertification of land is happening in India like in Punjab due to over use of water as the excess water tends to bring out the natural salts in the soil to come out to form a layer of salt which prevents the plants grow this making the land barren. Desertification also happens due to excessive deforestation which reduces the humus of the soil and thus leads to decreased fertility of the soil. Agro forestry is the best solution to counter desertification and to protect quality of the soil.

793,none,"Today in Labor History May 31, 1889: The Johnstown Flood. 2,209 people died when a dam holding back a private resort lake burst upstream from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. It was the deadliest U.S. disaster to date. Bodies were found as far away as Cincinnati. It caused $17 million of damage (about $490 million in 2020 dollars).

Wealthy industrialists, like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick owned and patronized the resort. They had built cottages and a clubhouse and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive and private mountain retreat. They had also lowered the dam to build a road across it and installed a fish screen in the spillway that tended to trap debris. Investigators believe these alterations contributed to the disaster. Yet none of the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club were found guilty of any crimes. Furthermore, survivors repeatedly lost court cases in their attempts to recover damages due to the club members‚Äô wealth and expensive legal team. However, public outrage did prompt changes in American law leading to one of strict liability in future cases.

Standing Message - Lake Erie & Lake St. Clair - High Static Water Level

Sunday, June 6, 2021

‚Ä¢ Current water levels are down from where they were at this time of the year in 2020, 2019 or even 2018, but are still well above average.

‚Ä¢ There is a risk of flooding and shoreline damage along the shorelines of Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair

‚Ä¢ Sustained wind speeds above moderate can create waves that cause flooding, erosion, and shoreline damage.

‚Ä¢ Risk of erosion and damage to shoreline protection works, including erosion along the high bluffs.

""KalpVriksha"" ~ or #treeoflife has a philosophical concept in Mithila Art form. It gives life to all the animals, birds , reptiles & plants. It is deeply rooted into the earth(soil) and thus supports the life benith. 
With the advent of massive urbanization we are just cutting trees for the sake of skyscrapers and industries. Our earth is left with tall buildings, advanced technology but without life !! We have gifted our earth with the gift of #Deforestation & adverse effects of #globalwarming ! 
Regular #Floods , the affected marine life & excessive heat  are some of the consequences. .
My Canvas Painting #Vipalava depicts Under water life, animal - plant kingdom ,  Modern World, infrastructure & its consequences.
Its  a #contemporary Mithila Painting where I have tried to depict the complete idea in the #FolkArt form !!

And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.""-Hebrews 9:9-17

330,none,"The government of #Chile and the National Geographic Society are going to new heights in a search for answers about the 11-year #drought plaguing the central part of the country. With the Ministry of #Agriculture declaring emergencies in over 50 municipalities, the toll is clear, yet the meteorological factors behind the megadrought remain shrouded in mystery. 

So with a little help from luxury watchmaker rolex, insidenatgeo teamed up with Chile‚Äôs Ministry of Public Works on a mission to install a weather station on the highest mountain in the #Andes: the dormant Tupungato Volcano. 

Based on their experience launching similar projects on Mount Everest, the team knew the #weather station had to be durable enough to withstand high winds, but light enough to be carried up the mountain and assembled on site. Deep snow and pandemic protocols presented logistical challenges, but the team pulled it off.

Now it‚Äôs all about collecting #data‚Äîgetting near-real-time reads on temperature, humidity, moisture, barometric pressure and solar radiation. As it‚Äôs collected, data will be transmitted to monitoring facilities, with researchers and Chilean officials aiming to collect data over multiple seasons to understand how glaciers and the snow in water towers like Tupungato respond to #climatechange. And that info, in turn, will help improve forecasting models.

The ultimate goal? ‚ÄúSupport and elevate solutions that can help restore balance to our ecosystems,‚Äù said Nicole Alexiev, vice president, #science and #innovation, National Geographic Society.

In fact flows are lower now than they were in 2014 when the river disconnected in the fall and left migrating Chinook suffering from elevated levels of disease. This is why we asked the Humboldt County Supervisors last week to take immediate action and pass an emergency ordinance which would allow them to curtail groundwater pumping to preserve surface flows.

317,none,"Look up this week‚Äôs episode of HBO‚Äôs Bill Maher show.  This segment was on the state of water in California, big ag, and almonds!  Almond farming takes 80% of the potable water in California, and supplies about the same percentage of the world‚Äôs almond supply. However, almonds ARE grown in other places that HAVE adequate rainfall.

Residents are getting restrictions while almond farming mega corporations, along with Nestle and Coke are stealing the water that is owned by the residents of California, putting it in plastic bottles and selling it back to the residents at an incredible profit. 

Look how much water it takes to grow a pound of strawberries as compared to a pound of almonds.

California is burning while almond growers are continuing to get rich, rape the land, and use tons of pesticides in the process.

Maher says if Coal miners are being forced to retrain into other jobs that won‚Äôt kill people, so can almond farmers be. 

I agree. 

I haven‚Äôt bought almonds in years, but I admit to buying almond butter whenever I see it on sale.  It is anti-inflammatory, and a main ingredient in some of my best selling fermented snacks, but I will no longer buy it from California.  There are other things that are anti-inflammatory and don‚Äôt take such a heavy toll on the the ecosystem.

KNOW BETTER. DO BETTER.

The upper Arroyo Seco in Pasadena was beautiful with little graffiti and zero homeless camps. As soon as you get into LA County it becomes a big mess with homeless camps on both sides at various locations. We saw lots of wood-burning fires at these homeless camps along our route. It literally looks like good old-fashioned camping. 

Some dude yelled at me and Joe as we were passing by and said give me your bike. We just kept going. Didnt want to have break him off some and dish him out some broken bones lol.

Although it may not seem like much even a few inches of water can cause serious damage; resulting in thousands of dollars in repair and restoration costs. Homeowners insurance does not cover floods.

5,none,"Did you know that people with Down syndrome tend to have itty bitty passages in their bodies?

For example, Finn has teeny tiny ear canals, so tiny that no doctor has ever been able to see inside! Because his ear canals are so small, he uses a BAHA (bone-anchored hearing aid) to help the sound travel to his inner ear so he can hear normally.

Finn has teeny tiny tear ducts, so tiny that even after surgery in December, they are still not draining his tears properly. This is why you often see tears in his eyes or running down his cheeks even when he's not crying.

Finny will be getting surgery at the end of July because of these itty bitty passages. He'll be getting stints in his tear ducts to help his eyes drain properly. He'll also have a doctor look into his ears while he's sedated. They'll be checking for fluid and to make sure there is nothing structural obstructing his hearing. We're also hoping to get some scar tissue removed from his g-tube site. Thankfully, Finn does great during surgery and we have no doubt he will again.

[Image description: A toddler boy with tan skin, dark curly hair, and Down syndrome sits on an exam table in a doctor's office. His hands are up in the air excitedly. He is wearing a lime green tie-dye t-shirt, khaki shorts, dark blue tennis shoes, and a blue BAHA.]"

Here in New Mexico‚Äîand across the West‚Äîwildfire season is getting longer. Wildfires, bigger. And these trends will continue in our warming world. Between 1970 and 2020, New Mexico‚Äôs average annual temperature has risen by 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit‚Äîand forecasts show we‚Äôre in for more and more warming into the future. 

But wildfires aren‚Äôt the only problem spurred by rising temperatures and drought, which have even more impacts on our forests, including insect infestations. 

On this month‚Äôs episode of Our Land, we look at how climate change is altering New Mexico‚Äôs forests. And what the future holds. 

Guests: 
Laura McCarthy, New Mexico State Forester 
Daniel Denipah, Forestry Director, Pueblo of Santa Clara

726,none,"After #Warpaint filled our ears in 2010 with their acclaimed debut The Fool, they were been honing their sound on the road before escaping to The Joshua Tree to record their 2014 eponymous second, co-produced by the band and #Flood (PJ Harvey, New Order, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds) and mixed by Flood and #NigelGodrich. Artist and director #ChrisCunningham also worked closely with the band to create artwork for the album, as well as a forthcoming documentary - nutsack monster was not included.
Alongside single Love Is To Die, Warpaint bring beefed up electronics to their tracks to sculpt their woozy #shoegaze into something sinisterly sexy. ""I don't know if this is TMI or something,"" Wayman told the Guide, ""but if you really fall into music while you're playing, it's the same space as when you are with a lover. You can see guitar players in the way that they're playing that they're in some ecstatic moment and it could equally be a sexual moment where they're alone with someone. So if I were to actually put it all into a pot and think about it, playing music can take you closer to that same kind of state of ecstacy as an orgasm. Sometimes that can be very alarming if you're onstage."""

1194,none,"These simple tips can help you prevent heavy rain and flooding from damaging your property. To begin with, make sure that all drains near your home are free of debris. This will prevent road water from spilling into your yard. Have a battery backup in case the power goes out. Also, it is good to install a sump pump in your basement and crawlspace.

285,none,"Dangerously hot temperatures gripping parts of the Western U.S. will continue to smash records as the week comes to a close.

üî• A large dome of high pressure in the upper atmosphere¬†has developed over the West.
Beneath the dome, sinking air is causing temperatures to soar well over 100 degrees in many areas.
Heat alerts have been issued by the National Weather Service for various time periods this week, from parts of the Southwest into the Great Basin and California.

üö© Records have already been broken in this heat wave and more are likely to fall in the days ahead, from the Central Rockies into the Desert Southwest and California.
Salt Lake City tied its all-time record high for any day of the year yesterday when it hit 107 degrees.
That followed daily record highs on Sunday (102 degrees) and Monday (103 degrees).
Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Sacramento are some of the cities that could set at least daily record highs through late this week.

‚ö†Ô∏è Outdoor activities should be limited in these areas because of the possibility of heat-related illnesses.
The core of the heat will be most persistent in the Southwest, but it will also affect parts of the Great Basin and Rockies.
It will spread into California's central valley for the end of the week.
Wildfire concerns will also be elevated this week because of the hot temperatures in combination with long-term drought conditions in place across a large part of the West.
