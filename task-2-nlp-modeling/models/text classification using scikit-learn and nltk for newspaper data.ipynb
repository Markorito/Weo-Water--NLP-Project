The lack of rain, which is also affecting neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, and political instability have tipped Somalia into a food crisis that could persist, even as drought conditions abate.\\n\\nImage courtesy United Nations A malnourished child waits for emergency medical assistance from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), an active regional peacekeeping mission operated by the African Union with the approval of the United Nations. Somalia is the country worst affected by a severe drought that has ravaged large swaths of the Horn of Africa, leaving an estimated 11 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\\n\\nVulnerability to diseases is also of grave concern â according to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR, hundreds of Somali children are dying from a combination of acute malnutrition and measles.\\n\\nMore than half of Somaliaâs population is now suffering from lack of food as famine spreads to the Bay region of the country, where food production has fallen 82 percent, according to Voice of America. The famine â officially declared in July â is due in part to a La NiÃ±a-induced drought that first hit the Horn of Africa in 2010 and has continued into 2011.\\n\\nThe El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon consisting of El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a cycles, and, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), although ENSO is naturally occurring, a warming climate may contribute to an increase in the frequency and intensity of El NiÃ±o cycles. This cycle is being classified as a moderate-to-strong La NiÃ±a, following 2009âs especially intense El NiÃ±o year.\\n\\nLa NiÃ±a is characterized by colder-than-normal water surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, causing heavy rains in Australia, Southeast Asia, and South America, while causing drought conditions in eastern Africa.\\n\\nWhile drought still prevails in the region, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has reported that there should be near normal rainfall in the Horn of Africa by the end of this year. Though there is still the possibility of another La NiÃ±a, it is expected to be weaker than the current cycle. Either way â whether next year there is no La NiÃ±a, or just a weakened one â drought conditions will likely ease in the coming months, according to Voice of America.\\n\\nThe weakening of the drought, however, does not necessarily spell the end of the famine.\\n\\nFood â if it becomes available â is difficult to distribute, and this is the challenge facing aid organizations, which have not lacked supplies as much as the means to get those supplies to people in need. Additionally, Somalia is still in a state of conflict, which will have a great influence on the future of its food supplies. The countryâs government, though internationally recognized, is weak and opposed by a number of groups, including the Islamist al-Shabaab, which controls much of the country that has been hit hardest by the famine, the Guardian reported.\\n\\nThe political instability â and resulting inefficiency â also contributed to creating the crisis in the first place, WMO climate expert Rupa Kumar Kolli told Voice of America. Kolli said that meteorologists predicted the drought well in advance and warned policy makers in the affected countries, but they got little response because weather and climate information is often not taken seriously.\\n\\nâFamines are man-made, whereas droughts are natural parts of the system,â Kolli said.\\n\\nGovernment policies encouraging agricultural practices that better utilize water resources will be key to future food security in the Horn of Africaâs arid regions. According to Jeff Hill, director for policy at USAid, this means investing in pastoral livestock farmers, the Guardian reported.\\n\\nâLivestock provides more food security than growing crops in many arid and semi-arid areas,â Hill said.\\n\\nUnlike crops, livestock can be moved to water during the dry seasonâ but, currently, farmers often cannot move their herds freely, sometimes due to cultural and international borders, as was the case earlier this year in a dispute between two ethnic groups on either side of the Ethiopia-Kenya border. If they were allowed to follow the water, rural farmers could become more resistant to drought and famine.\\n\\nSources: Guardian; Voice of America\\n\\nA news correspondent for Circle of Blue based out of Hawaii.

       "      <th>The blistering heat experienced by the United States during August, as well as the June through August months, marks the second warmest summer on record, according to scientists at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, N.C. The persistent heat, combined with below-average precipitation across the southern U.S. during August and the three summer months, continued a record-breaking drought across the region.\\n\\nThe average U.S. temperature in August was 75.7 degrees F, which is 3.0 degrees above the long-term (1901-2000) average, while the summertime temperature was 74.5 degrees F, which is 2.4 degrees above average. The warmest August on record for the contiguous United States was 75.8 degrees F in 1983, while its warmest summer on record at 74.6 degrees F occurred in 1936. Precipitation across the nation during August averaged 2.31 inches, 0.29 inches below the long-term average. The nationwide summer precipitation was 1.0 inch below average.\\n\\nThis monthly analysis, based on records dating back to 1895, is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides.\\n\\nU.S. climate highlights -- August\\n\\nExcessive heat in six states -- Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana -- resulted in their warmest August on record. This year ranked in the top ten warmest August for five other states: Florida (3rd), Georgia (4th), Utah (5th), Wyoming (8th), and South Carolina (9th).The Southwest and South also had their warmest August on record.\\n\\nOnly nine of the lower 48 states experienced August temperatures near average, and no state had August average temperatures below average.\\n\\nWetter-than-normal conditions were widespread across the Northeastern United States, which had its second wettest August, as well as parts of the Northern Plains and California. Drier-than-normal conditions reigned across the interior West, the Midwest, and the South.\\n\\nHurricane Irene made landfall near Cape Lookout, N.C. as a Category 1 storm on August 27, marking the first hurricane landfall in the U.S. since Hurricane Ike in September 2008. Irene made a second landfall in New Jersey as a hurricane on August 28, marking only the second recorded hurricane landfall in that state.\\n\\nIrene contributed to New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire having their wettest August on record. Meanwhile, Massachusetts (2nd), Connecticut (2nd), Delaware (3rd), Maine (3rd), Maryland (5th), Pennsylvania (5th), and Rhode Island (9th) had a top 10 wet August.\\n\\nSeveral major U.S. cities broke all-time monthly rainfall amounts during August. New York City (Central Park) measured 18.95 inches of rain, exceeding the previous record of 16.85 inches in 1882. In Philadelphia, 19.31 inches of rain was observed, besting the previous monthly record of 13.07 inches in September 1999.\\n\\nLouisiana (3rd), Tennessee (4th), Texas (5th), Mississippi (6th), Georgia, (6th), Illinois (8th), Washington (9th), and Alabama (9th) had precipitation totals among their top ten driest on record.\\n\\nDespite record rainfall in parts of the country, drought covered about one-third of the contiguous United States, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index indicated that parts of Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas are experiencing drought of greater intensity, but not yet duration, than those of the 1930s and 1950s. Drought intensity refers to the rate at which surface and ground water is lost, due to a combination of several factors, including evaporation and lack of precipitation.\\n\\nAn analysis of Texas statewide tree-ring records dating back to 1550 indicates that the summer 2011 drought in Texas is matched by only one summer (1789), indicating that the summer 2011 drought appears to be unusual even in the context of the multi-century tree-ring record.\\n\\nU.S. climate highlights -- Summer\\n\\nTexas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Louisiana had their warmest (June-August) summers on record. Average summer temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma, at 86.8 degrees F and 86.5 degrees F, respectively, exceeded the previous seasonal statewide average temperature record for any state during any season. The previous warmest summer statewide average temperature was in Oklahoma, during 1934 at 85.2 degrees F.\\n\\nFifteen states had a summer average temperature ranking among their top ten warmest. West of the Rockies, a persistent trough brought below-average temperatures to the Pacific Northwest, where Washington and Oregon were the only states across the lower 48 to have below-average summer temperatures.\\n\\nTexas had its driest summer on record, with a statewide average of 2.44 inches of rain. This is 5.29 inches below the long-term average, and 1.04 inches less than the previous driest summer in 1956. New Mexico had its second driest summer and Oklahoma its third driest summer. New Jersey and California had their wettest summers on record with 22.50 inches and 1.93 inches, respectively.\\n\\nThe U.S. Climate Extremes Index, a measure of the percent area of the country experiencing extreme climate conditions, was nearly four times the average value was during summer 2011. This is the third largest summer value of the record, which dates to 1910. The major drivers were extremes in warm minimum and maximum temperatures and in the wet and dry tails of the Palmer Drought Severity Index.\\n\\nBased on NOAA's Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index, the contiguous U.S. temperature-related energy demand was 22.3 percent above average during summer. This is the largest such value during the index's period of record, which dates to 1895.\\n\\nOther U.S. climate highlights\\n\\nDuring the six-month period (March-August), much-above-average temperatures dominated the southern and eastern United States. New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, all experienced their warmest March-August on record. Cooler-than-average temperatures dominated the West and Northwest.\\n\\nFor the year-to-date period, the average statewide temperature for Texas was 69.9 degrees F, the warmest such period on record for the state. This bests the previous record for the year-to-date period of 69.8 degrees F in 2000.</th>\n",

       "      <th>(CNN) -- The summer of 2011 was the second hottest on record for the United States, and the hottest in 75 years, government weather experts said Thursday.\\n\\nLouisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas experienced their warmest summers ever, with several states seeing an average of more than 86 degrees, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\\n\\nFor meteorological purposes, summer consists of the months of June, July and August.\\n\\nAt least 22 people died as a result of the heat wave that swept the nation earlier this summer, according to the National Weather Service.\\n\\nFor 15 states, the average temperature ranked among their top 10 warmest, while overall, 46 of the lower 48 states saw average to above-average temperatures. Oregon and Washington were the only exceptions.\\n\\nTexas had the distinction of experiencing the warmest summer on record of any state in America, with an average of 86.8 degrees. Dallas residents sweltered for 40 consecutive days of grueling 100-plus degree temperatures. Oklahoma, at 86.5, also topped the previous record, of 85.2 degrees, set in Oklahoma in 1934, amid what became known as the Dust Bowl.\\n\\nFor the month of August, Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas had their warmest in recorded history, while regionally, the Southwest and South also had their warmest August ever. Only nine of the lower 48 states saw August temperatures near their average readings, while none experienced below-average temperatures.\\n\\nTemperature-related energy demands soared more than 22% above the norm this summer, the largest increase since record-keeping of energy demands began more than a century ago, NOAA said.\\n\\nThe persistently warm temperatures for the months of June through August, combined with below-average precipitation, also contributed to a record-breaking drought across the southern part of the United States. Texas was subjected to its driest summer ever, with a statewide average of only 2.44 inches of rain -- 5.29 inches below the long-term average, and more than an inch less than the previous driest summer in 1956.\\n\\nNeighboring Southwestern states New Mexico and Oklahoma were also drought-stricken, experiencing their second- and third-driest summers respectively. Conversely, New Jersey and California had their wettest summers ever.\\n\\nMeteorologists are predicting no immediate end in sight to the heat or drought afflicting the Southern states. NOAA announced Thursday that la nina, a naturally occurring climate phenomenon located over the tropical Pacific Ocean, is expected to strengthen and affect global weather patterns. Scientists attribute the extreme weather around the globe during the first half of 2011 to the weather event, and predict that the drought currently overtaking the states of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma is likely to persist.\\n\\nThe extremely dry plains are a tinderbox for Texas; nearly 180 wildfires have been reported across the state in the past seven days, the Texas Forest Service Texas said. A large wildfire blazing outside Austin has destroyed nearly 1,400 homes and is not near containment.</th>\n",

FILE PHOTO | NMG\\n\\nBy LEOPOLD OBI\\n\\nMore by this Author Summary Those who called the semi-permanent structures home would have loved to continue living there, but apocalyptic floods made their choice for them.\\n\\nThe floods which began in early 2020 displaced more than 200,000 people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania- the three East African countries.\\n\\nExperts now warn that the flood is unlikely to be a one-off occurrence.\\n\\nBuildings that once stood defiantly along Chuowe Beach in Homabay on the shores of Lake Victoria now seem set to surrender to the unlikely fate of never being inhabited again after spending months strapped under water.\\n\\nThose who called the semi-permanent structures home would have loved to continue living there, but apocalyptic floods made their choice for them.\\n\\nThe floods which began in early 2020 displaced more than 200,000 people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania- the three East African countries relying on the continentÃ¢??s largest fresh water lake. Lake Victoria Basin Commission says the water body rose to a new record level of 13.42 metre Ã¢?? marginally higher than the 13.41 metre mark recorded in 1964.\\n\\nBefore the floods, Willis Omulo, his family and scores of locals around his tiny village in Karachuonyo North were living quite a normal life. They tilled their farms and went fishing. Others also harvested sand, indiscriminately.\\n\\nIn 2018, while covering sand harvesting incidents that was turning the village into ruins, Omulo Ã¢?? an environmental activist at Aluora Makare CBO Ã¢?? happily took us around.\\n\\nAt the time he was living in a one bedroom house built of iron sheets, from the wall to the roof. The structure, he says, could resist flash floods common in the area during heavy rains.\\n\\nSubmerged farms\\n\\nLast week we returned to the village to follow up on sand harvesting, and asked Omulo who has been advocating for tree planting in the village to take us to his tree farm.\\n\\nThe father of one pensively looked into the far distance before calling an old man to hand him a boat paddle. He then steered the canoe into the water after which we all jumped in to head to the farm.\\n\\nÃ¢??The farm no longer exists anymore. It was submerged,Ã¢?Â he offered, Ã¢??I donÃ¢??t have a home either and for the last 12 months my family is being hosted at a nearby dispensary.Ã¢?Â\\n\\nAs we silently paddled the wooden boat to what used to be his home, OmuloÃ¢??s frustration as a young family man looked palpable even behind the dark glass he wore.\\n\\nAlice Kiche, mother of eight, explained the night when floods came. Everyone was comfortably asleep and nothing out of the ordinary was anticipated. Then suddenly, the lake swelled before furiously tearing its ways into nearby homes and farms.\\n\\nÃ¢??The flash floods were so fast and strong we only managed to rescue our children and a few belongings but everything else was lost,Ã¢?Â the widow said.\\n\\nHer two-bedroom bricked house was marooned and destroyed by the floods.\\n\\nÃ¢??We sought refuge in a classroom at a nearby school. But moved out when schools reopened,Ã¢?Â she explained, adding that all her plots were swallowed by the lake.\\n\\nThe villagers thought the floods would disappear in a week or two. But more than a year later Kiche, her children including three daughters-in-law remain without a permanent place to call home.\\n\\nExperts now warn that the flood is unlikely to be a one-off occurrence.\\n\\nThe high water levels in the lake will be more frequent in the future due to heavy rainfalls, Dr Lydia Olaka, a geoscientist at the University of Nairobi warned Ã¢?? barely giving the region time to recover from one crisis, before another hits\\n\\nBefore the tragic floods, the beach was a lively spot, a fish landing bay and a convenient market for dealers like Kiche. Yet now it has been submerged by waist-high waters, sinking all the business in the process.\\n\\nHungry and homeless\\n\\nItÃ¢??s not just those that rely on the lake for their livelihoods that have been affected. Like Kiche, Elijah NgÃ¢??ongÃ¢??o, 54, has spent seven months living in his neighbourÃ¢??s kitchen.\\n\\nTowards the end of 2019 as farmers in prepared for planting during the October-December short rains, NgÃ¢??ongÃ¢??o and his fellow villagers also prepared their farms. All went well until extreme rainfall came, flooded and swept the farms away, leaving them hungry and homeless.\\n\\nÃ¢??We are living in very desperate conditions. IÃ¢??m a farmer who doesnÃ¢??t like living at the mercy of others. But IÃ¢??ve become helpless after floods drowned all my harvest,Ã¢?Â he said.\\n\\nApart from the heavy rains, which are forcing a back flow of the lake, wanton sand harvesting is partly to blame with the rapid expansion of the lake.\\n\\nWith the top sandy soil heavily harvested, the layer left behind is close to the water table which easily recharges during heavy rains, adding to the deluge, the villagers observed.\\n\\nBesides the floods, the village also do not have electricity.\\n\\nÃ¢??Sand harvesters left electric poles standing dangerously, some have since collapsed, therefore Kenya Power disconnected the entire village,Ã¢?Â said William Amuom, a resident adding that some locals now use the power lines to hang their cloths.\\n\\nBecause of the swelling lake, wild animals such as hippos have not only moved to live closer to the people but are also terrorising them days on end.\\n\\nThe flood victims said the government promised them building materials, but over 12 months later they were still holding on.\\n\\nDr Olaka explained that the rains in the region were unusually heavy and due to the Indian Ocean Dipole Ã¢?? a weather phenomenon caused by differences in sea surface temperatures between the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean.\\n\\nApart from property destructions, there are concerns that floods have also increased the spread of pollution, and potential for disease.\\n\\nProf Richard Muga, health chief executive officer in Homabay, said the area was lucky to have escaped a public health crisis amid the floods and Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThe lakeÃ¢??s backwash flooded toilets, which posed a deadly risk to the communities who lack piped water. Prof Muga said the county had to spend millions of shillings distributing water treatment tablets to avert water borne diseases.\\n\\nSo far, the national government has provided little help beyond advising residents to move, said Omulo.\\n\\nÃ¢??The government keeps telling us to move to higher grounds, yet they are not telling us where on the higher grounds they have reserved land for us,Ã¢?Â he said.</th>\n",

       "      <th>This story originally appeared in EOS.org and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story.\\n\\nIn much of the world, climate change is altering regional growing conditions and making them more unpredictable. Farmers are finding it harder to consistently grow enough food to meet increasing demand. Securing the worldÃ¢??s food supply for the future, experts assert, requires us to tally the good and the bad in the current agricultural structure, including the infrastructure and technology in food distribution systems.\\n\\nSmall farms, which account for about 90 percent of the worldÃ¢??s 570 million farms, are particularly vulnerable to changes in seasonal climate. Land tended by families for generations suddenly may become nonarable. A change in the timing or intensity of yearly rainy seasons or the El NiÃÂ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), for example, could bring rains or drought that wipe out a familyÃ¢??s crops.\\n\\nIn early May, the Nzoia River burst its banks. The floods that resulted in western Kenya capped off particularly heavy long rains that killed 237 people and adversely affected more than 800,000. Floods and landslides destroyed homes, schools, roads, bridges and more than 8,000 acres of Kenyan farmland.\\n\\nKenyaÃ¢??s March-May rainy season (the long rains, as opposed to the short rains of October-December) provides vital moisture to the countryÃ¢??s croplands Ã¢?? indeed, maize production was at least 10 percent above average in 2020 Ã¢?? but most Kenyans continue to face some level of food insecurity. In the past few years especially, climate change has caused a geographical shift in which areas receive rain and which suffer drought.\\n\\n\"Normally, we know where the flood areas are, but the rains the past few years have been unprecedented,\" said Ruth K. OniangÃ¢??o, founder of the Rural Outreach Africa Program and a 2017 Africa Food Prize Laureate. \"We have rain falling in areas that never used to have rain. I used to write all the time about famines and drought Ã¢?Â¦ but right now is something different. We can say, Ã¢??OK, climate variability, it changes every year.Ã¢?? No. This is different right now.\"\\n\\nThe differences extend beyond Africa. Farmers in Iran, for example, share similar problems anticipating cycles of drought and floods despite being separated from their Kenyan counterparts by more than 4,350 miles. \"The recent harsh droughts and heavy floods in the [Middle East] region ruined a major part of food resources,\" explained Mohanna Zarei, a water resources engineer at the University of Kurdistan in Sanandaj, Iran. Sporadic precipitation cycles not only reduce crop yields but also can lead to secondary impacts that worsen food security, such as the wildfires that have ravaged the western United States, Australia, Brazil and elsewhere.\\n\\nFinancial and social inequality compound climate-related food security issues. Many of the worldÃ¢??s smallholder farmers are poor and food insecure; even one lost season can push them from struggling to failing. \"Climate change plays a key role as a catalyzer\" in amplifying preexisting resource problems and \"will influence the quality and quantity of food we produce and our ability to distribute it equitably,\" Zarei said.\\n\\n\"ItÃ¢??s not quite as simple as moving into less climate-affected areas. It remains an issue of climate and socioeconomic and technological development,\" said Weston Anderson, a hydroclimatologist at the International Research Institute (IRI) for Climate and Society at Columbia University. Understanding how agricultural practices and policies need to change along with the warming climate and then sowing the seeds of that change could be the difference between farmers thriving where they are or migrating to greener pastures.\\n\\nStressing the climate system\\n\\nA regionÃ¢??s agricultural stability depends on reliable, natural climate variations to bring seasonal shifts in weather. Large-scale climate modes such as ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole govern a regionÃ¢??s temperature, precipitation and storm activity for months at a time. Climate modes also causally connect distant regions, something increasingly important as agricultural trade has become more global: A climate shift in one food-growing region also can affect crops half a world away.\\n\\nMaize farmers around the world felt the impacts of climate teleconnections during one of the strongest El NiÃÂ±os of the past 150 years. The 1983 El NiÃÂ±o coincided with the largest global synchronous failure of maize crops in modern record, and recent research has shown that ENSO played a major role in causing that failure.\\n\\nOften you see climate change acting on top of this climate variability and exacerbating stresses that are already existing in our food system.\\n\\n\"The El NiÃÂ±o-Southern Oscillation, because it organizes global weather and global precipitation, provides structure on the risk of global agriculture by rearranging where we get more drought and less drought in the year,\" Anderson explained. \"ItÃ¢??s not necessarily creating more drought over the entire year, but it might be arranging those droughts in a way that disproportionately affects some of our crop growing regions.\"\\n\\nAndersonÃ¢??s team found that ENSO is the only mode of climate variability that can affect maize, wheat and soybean crop production on a global scale. Other large-scale climate modes have more localized influence on certain crop yields. The tropical Atlantic variability, for instance, influences maize production in western Africa and wheat and soy production in southeastern South America simultaneously, but the North Atlantic Oscillation affects only wheat production in northern Africa and Europe.\\n\\n\"Climate will largely continue to affect our food system through climate variability,\" Anderson said. \"Often you see climate change acting on top of this climate variability and exacerbating stresses that are already existing in our food system.\" For example, he said, a regional crop might withstand a normal ENSO-related drought but could fail if climate change-induced drought worsens, too.\\n\\nDown in the dirt\\n\\nMoreover, climate change also affects what goes on beneath EarthÃ¢??s surface. To sustain an agricultural system with consistent, high and high-quality yield, \"you need the soil system to first and foremost be able to support plants,Ã¢?Â said Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, a soil biogeochemist at the University of California, Merced. \"Plants need physical support from the soil, and they also need nutrients and water to be available in the right forms and in the right time when plants need them.\"\\n\\nAccording to a 2015 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about one-third of the worldÃ¢??s soil is moderately to highly degraded, and the conditions causing that degradation are, overall, getting worse. Unsustainable agricultural practices cause some decline in soil health, and some is caused by climate change, Berhe said. \"Hot temperatures, for example, are associated with rapid loss of organic matter from soil. This is a major issue, as organic matter is the major storehouse of food and energy for microbes in soil that are key for regulating nutrient availability.\"\\n\\nMoreover, \"the episodic high-intensity rainfall, wet periods and droughts, the going back and forth between extremes, could also lead to conditions where soils are actually eroding at a fast rate, especially under intense precipitation events,\" Berhe added. \"ThatÃ¢??s a major concern.\" Altered rainfall patterns also can unbalance a soilÃ¢??s oxygen availability, acidity, salinity and water-holding capacity and can hinder the formation of new soil.\\n\\n\"Climate change reshapes the relationships among crops, pests, pathogens and weeds,\" Zarei said. \"And it intensifies several trends, including declines in pollinating insects, increasing water scarcity, increasing ground-level ozone concentrations and fishery declines. Climate change [has] posed pressures on availability of water resources for agriculture by shifting precipitation patterns, earlier seasonal snowmelt and intrusion of saltwater into coastal aquifers.\"\\n\\nIt is true that some areas of the world are becoming more arable in the face of climate change, especially the Arctic. The warming planet pushes the agricultural frontier poleward and into carbon-rich areas of thawed permafrost and peatland. \"The climate envelope moving means that certain areas are now able to support different types of habitats,Ã¢?Â Berhe said. \"But I think itÃ¢??s a little hard to call that improving soil health because of the way we got there.\"\\n\\nThe health of the soil beneath vegetation, called relative soil health, is a fundamental aspect of food security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, roughly one third of the worldÃ¢??s soils are moderately degraded (pink) or in worse condition (red and burgundy). Regions that maintain good (green) or only slightly degraded (yellow) soils are, for the most part, uncultivated. // Image courtesy of FAO.\\n\\n\"A northward shift in where we grow foods commercially is one of the most likely new agricultural frontiers,\" said Merritt Turetsky. \"The cost of imported foods in the Arctic can be exorbitant.\" Turetsky is an ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and a science adviser for Eos. \"Could an increase in commercial or local food production at high latitudes solve this problem of high food prices? Maybe, but it is likely to introduce some complex challenges for northern regions and the people who depend on those lands.\"\\n\\nDeclining soil health around the world also encourages governments to cultivate untouched ecosystems, which can worsen environmental problems in the long run. For example, \"we know that drainage of tropical peatlands for palm oil production has released large amounts of stored peat carbon to the atmosphere,\" Turetsky continued. \"As a society, we must protect our northern peatlands and carbon-rich soils from drainage and cultivation.\"\\n\\nShort-term fixes make long-term problems\\n\\nWhen it comes to humanityÃ¢??s role in the decline in soil health and the growing unpredictability in crop yield, some aspects are out of farmersÃ¢?? hands: rapid urbanization; inefficient infrastructures; unstable political relations; war. Problems such as widespread poverty, hunger, government corruption, gender inequality and lack of education multiply food security issues around the globe.\\n\\nHowever, some ways in which farmers mitigate agricultural uncertainty, which may raise short-term yields, actually worsen growing conditions in the long run. The landsÃ¢?? \"ability to provide the food, feed and fiber that we were getting from them is getting compromised,\" Berhe said. \"And so the only way to keep the lands productive, then, is to keep pumping them full of supplements in the form of fertilizers, in the form of irrigation water, in the form of tilling them even more destructively\" than we do now.\\n\\nWhen crop yields go down, farmers try to expand into new land. \"But sometimes extending into other areas means that people are now working on marginal lands that we know are susceptible to degradation,\" Berhe explained. Marginal lands often already have poor soil or are prone to erosion. \"That could play out in very disastrous ways when people move away from their home or expand their production systems,\" Berhe added.\\n\\nToo, lands might be marginal because they are wet, Turetsky added, and wetlands and seasonally flooded lands tend to store more carbon than more productive lands do. \"This means that extending agricultural practices can release more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere as those new soils are disturbed,\" she said.\\n\\nMany growers believe that increasing the amount of fertilizer is synonymous with good yield.\\n\\nThe use of fertilizer also can cause significant long-term environmental damage. \"The issue of fertilizer is a central concern in the Senegal River valley,\" said Mor Ndiaye, an agricultural engineer and soil scientist who works with smallholder rice farmers in the valley. Ndiaye works at SAED, an organization that promotes sustainable agriculture in Saint-Louis, Senegal.\\n\\n\"As the use of fertilizer in agriculture has become more and more essential, however, the quality of the soil is not very often taken into account when it comes to the purchase of fertilizer by farmers [and] producers,\" Ndiaye said. \"Many growers believe that increasing the amount of fertilizer is synonymous with good yield.\"\\n\\nHowever, \"adding nitrogen fertilizers into agricultural areas is one of the most important causes of nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere and the one that we have the hardest time taming,\" Berhe said. Nitrous oxide is the third most prevalent greenhouse gas. Ã¢??ItÃ¢??s a pretty vicious cycle.\"\\n\\nA lack of data also crops up as a problem when trying to secure agricultural production. Remote sensing data via satellite can provide environmental information such as temperature, moisture and plant cover, but it has data gaps. \"Often, remote sensing can get us 90 percent of the way there,\" said Matthew Cooper, an environmental geographer at the Harvard Data Science Initiative in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"You do need a lot of ground data to validate the remote sensing variables. Measuring the actual rainfall on the ground or measuring actual crop yields on the ground will always be more accurate than what youÃ¢??re trying to estimate from space.\"\\n\\nMoreover, smallholder farmers are more likely to thrive if they can analyze soil samples before buying and cultivating new land, but those data \"are sometimes difficult to obtain given the often exorbitant cost,\" Ndiaye said.\\n\\nAnd satellites canÃ¢??t collect data on \"things related to food systems around trade and access\" such as market prices, Cooper said. However, many governments lack resources for on-the-ground data collection initiatives as they tackle more immediate concerns, or as they attempt to mask the extent of environmental problems, for example, as has happened with deforestation in Brazil.\\n\\nCultivating a food secure future\\n\\nThe agricultural market has become irreversibly global, and with most nations far behind on climate goals, the impact of climate change on farmers is unlikely to abate. What can geoscientists do to support more sustainable agriculture in current food-growing regions and maintain soil health in new growing areas?\\n\\nIn some of the most food-insecure regions of the world, itÃ¢??s difficult to pinpoint what actions are needed because food security research simply doesnÃ¢??t cover those areas. According to a recent study that text-mined more than 16,000 abstracts from the food security literature, some of the most food-insecure regions of the world have very little presence in food security research, whereas some regions with high food security are overrepresented. \"Researchers tend to cluster in the countries where youÃ¢??re not at risk of a sudden civil war or there are already established research institutions or where people have already built full careers,\" said Cooper, lead researcher on the study. In more unstable areas, \"local policymakers there are pretty well informed of the local situation but Ã¢?Â¦ it seems like places outside the Anglosphere are less visible to the global community.\"\\n\\nAreas addressed in the current body of food security literature are not evenly spread across the globe. Some regions are overrepresented despite having high food security (bright green), whereas many food-insecure areas are underrepresented (bright pink) and need more attention. Regions with low food security that are well represented by current research practices (gray) likely have preexisting infrastructure to support academic research, like in eastern and western Africa.// Image Courtesy of Cooper et al.\\n\\nImproving data access is key. Even without on-the-ground data networks, \"we can tell a ton of stuff, especially about anything environmental, from remote sensing,\" Cooper said. \"You can get indices of vegetation health, precipitation, rainfall, droughts.\" But that information needs to make its way to farmers in a way they can use.\\n\\nWork such as NdiayeÃ¢??s helps connect smallholder farmers in developing agricultural areas with high-level data products such as digital soil maps. Access to that information has helped rice farmers in the Senegal River valley strengthen the capacity of their agricultural sector and establish trade partnerships between farmers, suppliers and buyers.\\n\\nMost experts agree that water availability will continue to be a bottleneck in expanding current agricultural areas and establishing new ones. \"Irrigation uses 66 percent of annual water withdrawals and is the single largest human use of water,\" Zarei said. But in some areas of the world, including some Middle Eastern countries, she explained, water resources are being used as political leverage rather than as a common resource to support regional stability.\\n\\nMoreover, the past 70 years or so have seen \"something like a 200 percent increase in irrigated agriculture area,\" Anderson said. \"And around 50 percent of that is not sustainable in the sense that weÃ¢??re drawing irrigation water unsustainably from either surface water or groundwater.\"\\n\\nIrrigated cultivation of rice paddies, seen here, accounts for roughly 70 percent of SenegalÃ¢??s total annual rice production. Developing sustainable irrigation infrastructure has governed much of the agricultural growth in recent decades and will continue to play a key role in our future food security// Image courtesy of Africa Rice Center\\n\\nCities such as Aqaba, Jordan; Bangkok, Thailand; Kampala, Uganda; Lima, Peru; and Manila, Philippines, have shifted to more sustainable water usage \"by reusing their wastewater and using this recycled water in the energy sector, food industry, agricultural irrigation, water sector [and] transitioning to a circular economy,\" Zarei said.\\n\\nLooking back at agricultural production since 1950, Anderson added, much of agricultureÃ¢??s geographic shift is tied directly to improvements in irrigation such as where rice is grown in China. \"When weÃ¢??re thinking about the future and future responses to climate change and the possibility of moving things out of these hotter regions,\" Anderson explained, \"it really remains intertwined with our ability to sustainably use water and to build irrigation infrastructure in a way that is conducive to growing these crops where we have the available land and nutrients.\"\\n\\nVulnerable beyond climate\\n\\nLast yearÃ¢??s East African floods may have boosted crop yields and eased food security concerns for people in rural areas, but the relief is temporary. \"Climate impacts are triggers, not the main drivers\" pushing smallholder farmers into poverty and insecurity, ÃÂngel G. MuÃÂ±oz said. Securing the worldÃ¢??s future food supply is as much about equity and economic stability as it is about sustainable agriculture, he said.\\n\\nConsider, for example, factors driving the recent caravan of thousands of people from Central America, and Guatemala in particular, toward the United States. \"What we have found Ã¢?Â¦ for the human migration that we saw in recent years from Guatemala is that itÃ¢??s related to a multiyear drought that occurred between 2015 and 2017,\" explained MuÃÂ±oz, a climate scientist at IRI. Smallholder farmers on the brink of poverty faced year after year of poor harvest, lost income and political instability that finally forced them to migrate northward in search of a way to support their families.\\n\\n\"What we have found is that, actually, although there is a clear climate signal,\" he said, referring to the drought, \"we do not see a very important climate change signal in this particular migrationÃ¢?Â¦. Socioeconomic factors and understanding the local vulnerability of the population are far more important than actually thinking in terms of only one stressor,\" such as climate change, driving farmers to new areas.\\n\\nNot all countries or regions face the same socioeconomic problems as Guatemala, but that example highlights the need for climate-smart agricultural policies to consider vulnerabilities beyond climate and account for socioeconomic context. \"That makes it a difficult problem to approach,\" Anderson said. \"Because itÃ¢??s certainly not something that can be solved entirely by scientists, or entirely through climate forecast-related approaches, or entirely in a policy sphere. You need all of these components, and so a lot of the work really is getting the right people talking to each other.\"\\n\\nThe particulars of those components, OniangÃ¢??o said, greatly depend on the country, but each vulnerability makes any agricultural adaptation solution that much more difficult to accomplish. In many U.N.-designated developing economies, girls and women are severely undereducated and underrepresented in the workforce. In some countries, government corruption prevents monetary aid from reaching farmers in need. Most countries, however, are missing the mark at organizing a migration of agricultural areas and supporting the farmers needed to make it work, she said.\\n\\nIt needs to be national policy, but implemented locally, and keeping vulnerable people in mind so that we donÃ¢??t push them to the edge.\\n\\n\"Even when new policies come up, or new trade practices come up, or when the world order changes Ã¢?? even if itÃ¢??s supposed to be in a positive way, it doesnÃ¢??t affect smallholder farmers positively,\" she said. \"I see increasing vulnerability because we have not been able to address the poverty issue, low income and hunger for many of the people I have been working with.\\n\\n\"The people themselves say, Ã¢??We have to move. We have to move from here.Ã¢?? But someone must organize them to move. It needs to be national policy, but implemented locally, and keeping vulnerable people in mind so that we donÃ¢??t push them to the edge.\"\\n\\nIn the end, the paths leading toward a climate-smart global agriculture already may be well-worn by generations of farmers. \"Indigenous communities in the north who rely on country foods that they harvest or hunt tend to be the most food-secure communities,\" Turetsky said. \"This is because these communities and traditions value the health of the boreal forest or the Arctic tundra. Any changes in local or commercial food production that do not uphold this value of the land or water may interfere with cultural traditions and practices. We must take the lessons learned from historical and existing food producing regions and ensure that we donÃ¢??t repeat the same mistakes.\"</th>\n",

       "      <th>HIGHLIGHTS\\n\\nÃ¢?Â¢ More than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS).\\n\\nÃ¢?Â¢ At least 120 people have reportedly died, including 72 people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County in north-western Kenya, according to the Government.\\n\\nÃ¢?Â¢ Infrastructure of undetermined value, including roads and bridges, have been damaged, hampering effective humanitarian response efforts in affected areas\\n\\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\\n\\nMost parts of the country continue to experience above average rainfall since the onset of the 2019 short rains (October Ã¢?? December). While the rainsÃ¢?? driven by the strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)Ã¢??might result in improved pasture conditions in arid and semi-arid lands, especially Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, and Wajir counties, as well as recharge of surface water pans and dams, including in Masinga, Kiambere and Turkwell dams, there are also reports of overspread damage, loss of lives and livelihoods due to heavy storms. Flash and riverine floods have affected at least 31 of the 47 KenyaÃ¢??s counties, including in Central, Coastal, Eastern, Northern, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western regions, and urban areas in Nairobi and Mombasa, according to the GovernmentÃ¢??s National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC). Landslides and mudslides have been reported in Meru, MurangÃ¢??a, Taita Taveta and West Pokot counties, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). Overall, more than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to KRCS.\\n\\nOn 22 November, landslides and mudslides in parts of West Pokot County resulted in the death of at least 72 people and displacement of more than 10,000 people, according to the County authorities. Farms, food stores and livestock were swept away, and two bridges along the Kitale-Lodwar road (Ortum) and along Sigor road (Chepera) were cut-off, leaving dozens of commuters stranded and disrupting communication networks in the area. Search and rescue efforts are still ongoing in the area and the numbers of affected population could increase in the coming days. According to the County authorities, priority needs in the area include food and shelter, medical attention, water treatment chemicals and critical non-food items.\\n\\nIn Wajir County, floods arising from rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands cut off all the roads leading to Bute and Gurar in Wajir North sub-county and washed away a bridge in Buna Town, impacting supplies and response in the area. Communication to Moyale and Bute was reportedly disrupted and at least 5,000 people near Buna market were displaced to higher grounds.\\n\\nIn Garissa and Tana River counties, heavy rains on 22 and 23 November led to massive flooding in the area, exacerbated by the bursting of Tana River. On 24 November, KRCS response teams rescued 15 people who had been marooned at Hadama location in Tana North Sub-county in Tana River County. Preliminary assessments from Tana River and Garissa indicate that 624 families have been displaced. In the Central region, at least 550 people were reportedly displaced in Tigania, in Meru County.\\n\\nSections of roads and bridges have been cut-off, paralyzing transport and humanitarian access in Embu, Garissa, Isiolo, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Mandera, Marsabit, Meru, Mombasa, Samburu, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Trans Nzoia, Turkana and Samburu counties. The Gurdis and Botula dams in Banisain Mandera County broke their walls or banks and require urgent repairs.\\n\\nIn Turkana, flash floods destroyed boreholes, calling for the installation of improved drainage system and relocation of people in affected residential areas to safer grounds. Public toilets and latrines have reported collapsed or are flooded in many areas, increasing the risks of disease outbreaks. Schools are closed in Trans Nzoia and Machakos counties, where several classrooms were flooded.\\n\\nAccording to the Kenya Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue across the country over the next few weeks, mainly due to the positive IOD measurements. Flood alerts have been issued especially for Coastal, Northern and Western regions of the country, with the risk of landslides and mudslides expected in parts of the Central Highlands and parts of the Rift Valley, including West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nandi counties.\\n\\nKenya was already facing increase hunger prior to the floods, with 3.1 million people projected to be in crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity since October, according to the latest report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).</th>\n",
