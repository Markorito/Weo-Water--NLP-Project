17995345744353911,"The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought is observed by United Nations and celebrated each year on 17 June. Its purpose is to raise awareness of the presence of desertification and drought, highlighting methods of preventing desertification and recovering from drought. Each year's global celebration has a unique, novel emphasis that had not been developed previously.This day was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on January 30, 1995, after the day when United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is drafted. This year's theme is ""Restoration, land and recovery. We build back better with healthy land."" Salanization and desertification of land is happening in India like in Punjab due to over use of water as the excess water tends to bring out the natural salts in the soil to come out to form a layer of salt which prevents the plants grow this making the land barren. Desertification also happens due to excessive deforestation which reduces the humus of the soil and thus leads to decreased fertility of the soil. Agro forestry is the best solution to counter desertification and to protect quality of the soil.
