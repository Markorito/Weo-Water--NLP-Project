18188192155097210,"When it comes to protecting your home or business from storms and natural weather events, prevention is the best medicine. There are several things that you can do to prevent major flooding damage from happening so that you do not have to contact a water damage professional. However, sometimes hiring a water damage restoration team can help you determine if there is, in fact, any unseen damage that could have occurred during a water event.

As far as prevention goes, here are a few tips:

Start at the source! If you are building a home in an area prone to flooding, use flood-resistant materials. FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have published lists of flood-resistant materials that can be used. Keep in mind that even flood-resistant materials can become damaged, the damage is usually cosmetic and can be repaired quickly. Flood-resistant materials limit the extent of the damage.

Build at a higher elevation. 

Homes that are built with the bottom floor above flood level are obviously much less likely to experience flood damage.
If you are in an area prone to flooding, levees and floodwalls are good barriers to prevent flooding inside the home. Sealing off areas where water can get into the home is helpful too.

Properly grate your property so that water will drain away from your walls. This is especially helpful if you have a basement as basements are prone to flood damage.

Clear your storm drains.

Keep leaves and debris cleared out of storm drains and gutters. Clogged gutters and storm drains will cause water from heavy rains to puddle. This can cause damage to the outside of your property and let water inside, causing floods.

Check your pipes. 

Pipes that are not properly insulated in the winter or do not receive proper maintenance can become major causes of property damage. Frozen pipes often expand and burst, causing horrendous water damage, and old pipes break open creating more flooding issues.

17948082199482527,"Shoreline Condition Statement - Flood Outlook

Standing Message - Lake Erie & Lake St. Clair - High Static Water Level

Sunday, June 6, 2021

• Current water levels are down from where they were at this time of the year in 2020, 2019 or even 2018, but are still well above average.

• There is a risk of flooding and shoreline damage along the shorelines of Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair

• Sustained wind speeds above moderate can create waves that cause flooding, erosion, and shoreline damage.

• Risk of erosion and damage to shoreline protection works, including erosion along the high bluffs.

17908983517803059,"With all this rain we have gotten over the last month, Yesterday was the first time to get out and check my game cameras. When I opened it up and noticed the card was wet. I didn’t think anything of it. Just thought it was moisture or something. When I got home, I saw I had over 2000 pictures on my card. After scrolling through the pictures, I thought for sure my camera was ruined, because all the pictures looked the same. Then all of sudden I see why. Haha. My muddyoutdoorsofficial game camera was fully submerged underwater for a couple of days. Keep in mind, my camera is 5 ft off the ground. The camera still worked and took pictures underwater. And when the water receded, it still took pictures of wildlife. You can see that the camera is still working because it took a picture of me walking up to it. I powered it off, changed cards and turned it back on, and it turned on just fine. I’ve had this camera for close to a year & a half with no problems at all. So I’ll see how long it will last after this.

- Non-damaging - but costly: these leaks are inconvenient, but don't cause significant damage to you home. They will cost you more time, energy and money to fix.
- Minimal damage - but will worsen over time: if left unattended to, these will result in more significant damage in the future. They often go unnoticed.
- Significant damage - home is being destroyed - act now: hopefully, you won't be in this category! Easy to identify, as your home is being flooded with water.

---------

ರಾಜ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಂಗಾರು ಮಳೆ ಆರಂಭವಾಗಿದೆ. ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು ಮಹಾ ನಗರದಲ್ಲಿ ಮಳೆಯಾದಾಗ ಪ್ರತೀ ಬಾರಿಯೂ ಒಂದಿಲ್ಲೊಂದು ಸಂಕಷ್ಟ ಎದುರಾಗುತ್ತಲೇ ಇರುತ್ತದೆ. ಪ್ರತೀ ವರ್ಷ ಕಡಿಮೆಯಿಂದರೂ 60-65 ದಿನಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಮಳೆ ಬೀಳುತ್ತದೆ. ಒಟ್ಟಾರೆಯಾಗಿ 900-950 ಮಿಮಿ ಮಳೆ ವಾಡಿಕೆಯಂತೆ ಬರುತ್ತದೆ. ಇಂತಹ ಮಳೆಗೆ ಸ್ಥಳೀಯ ಆಡಳಿತದ ಸಿದ್ದತೆ ಪ್ರತೀ ಬಾರಿಯೂ ಶೂನ್ಯವೇ ಆಗಿದೆ. ರಾಜಧಾನಿ ಕೇಂದ್ರವಾಗಿರುವುದರಿಂದ ಬೆಳೆಯುತ್ತಿರುವ ನಗರೀಕರಣ, ಅಭಿವೃದ್ದಿ ಕಾಮಗಾರಿಗಳು, ಮೂಲ ಸೌಕರ್ಯಗಳ ಕೊರತೆ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು ನಗರವನ್ನು ಮಳೆ ನೀರಿನಿಂದ ತೊಂದರೆ ಅನುಭವಿಸುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿದೆ.

18075251869281892,"Dear friends and colleagues, Guyana is currently experiencing the most horrible flood in the decade. 

Many people have been forced to evacuate their homes and businesses, due to rising water levels and wild species. For example, large Anacondas are found in people's homes and public spaces just outside of Georgetown, Guyana.

The globalpaintforcharity is currently working in partnership with the US Army and other humanitarian organizations to deploy disaster assistance to the victims in #Guyana, #Venezuela, #Honduras, El #Salvador and #Guatemala. 

We hope to soon have additional information, on how best to support the victims in the region. But help is needed, this is a great opportunity to show your support and contributions. 
Please visit www.globalpaints.org/emergency-relief to help us assist families in underserved communities. Our team begins to join efforts and provide brief support and safety but more help is needed.
Thank you so much for your continued support and contributions.
