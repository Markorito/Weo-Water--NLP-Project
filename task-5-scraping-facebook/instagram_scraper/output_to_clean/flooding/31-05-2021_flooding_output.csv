Showers are impacting northwestern Denver and portions of the central plains, as well as the southern part of the western slope. Temperatures are in the 40s and 50s for the plains, with 30s/40s for the mountains and 50s/60s for the western slope. Showers will increase for south-central Colorado over the next few hours, with some embedded thunderstorms capable of small hail and torrential rainfall. With these showers and thunderstorms comes a burn scar flood risk, and a flash flood watch has been issued for the Sangre de Cristo and Wet mountains until 10 PM tonight. Today will gradually see clearing by the evening hours in most areas, and in general today's forecast is evolving as expected.

The animals died and have been buried quickly before a set of crevasse splays shuffled up the bones after which they got fossilized.

newsroomgy

President Irfaan Ali was shocked at the lackadaisical approach by some pump attendants when he assessed several drainage pumps in and outside of Georgetown on Sunday night.

During the late-night inspection, the Head of State discovered that the pumps at Riverview were off, the koker doors were closed and the worker was asleep.

“This is what we are talking about, I came out here myself to verify tonight. The main pump to drain the city is turned off.  Up to today, we said that the pumps need to be on 24 hours…While we have to deal with the heavy rainfall we have to deal decisively with the irresponsibility and negligence,” he said.

17857956605550181,"Reading Fire Department Completes Water Rescue Ops 

On May 27-28, 2021; Reading Fire Department hosted a Water Rescue & Emergency Response (Ops Level) training session. This training session was part of the Reading Fire Academy Recruit Class. WhiteCap Water Rescue Training Staff Instructors, Todd Stahl, Mike Kiefer and Ken McCardell presented this training session. Steve Ginder provided Safety & Support for this training. 

This 16-hour course includes many valuable Swiftwater Rescue techniques. The course provides the base on which all other PA Fish & Boat Commission courses are built. Using both classroom, indoor pool and practical hands-on training, Water Rescue & Emergency Response covers planning, medical considerations, rescue equipment, self-rescue and shore-based rescue techniques. This course meets or exceeds NFPA 1670 Operations Level Guidelines.

The lecture part of the training was held at the berks County Fire Training Center, with the indoor pool sessions taking place at Governor Mifflin Intermediate School. The moving water session of the training was held on the Schuylkill River, at Kelly’s Lock. Jason Batz, Lieutenant Reading Fire Department scheduled and coordinated this training.

Twelve Fire Academy Recruits in attendance, successfully completed the indoor pool session, passed their written and practical exams for WRER. All students were properly outfitted and inspected their gear prior to arriving at the site. Upon starting the training, the students performed a site assessment and identified all hazards, shoreline conditions and water dynamics. A fantastic job by all! This group of recruits were young, energized and self-motivated.

Reading Fire Department provides Fire/Rescue, Fire Safety Education and Medical Services to the residents of Reading City and neighboring municipalities. 

Thank you to the City of Reading for choosing WhiteCap Water Rescue Training for all your Equipment and Training needs. It has been a pleasure to work with Lieutenant Batz and the Reading Fire Department. We look forward to working with your team in the future. readingfirelocal1640

16キロの贅沢な旅はまだ続きます😄
雨の後だから増水して楽しいけど、雨がなかったら水はもっと澄んでるはず😞
どっちもとれないので、どっちも見たい時は別々に行くしかないです😁
そして、また動画に指が映ってる…
そろそろ慣れたと思ったのに😔
見づらくてすみません🙇
動画を見てると、川が曲がってるのがよく分かります🛶
方向感覚のある人だったらどっち向いてるか分かるのかな❓
方向オンチの私は、もしここで降ろされても帰れません😅

18218468479066155,"More than 96,000 hectares of agricultural land has been inundated in eastern India due to a powerful storm this week, a year after a super cyclone ravaged the coastal region.

Cyclone Yaas swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday, triggering storm surges that broke through embankments in West Bengal state, mainly hitting the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans delta that stretches into neighbouring Bangladesh.

The storm has left more than 150,000 people homeless in eastern India and Bangladesh.
With climate change pushing up sea surface temperatures, the cyclonic storms that barrel in from the Bay of Bengal have become more aggressive and frequent, particularly in the last decade, according to researchers.

17873299724501484,"Hundreds of people have had to leave their homes as parts of New Zealand are hit with what has been described as a one-in-100-year deluge.

300 homes had to be evacuated overnight in the province of Canterbury in the country's South Island as this area seems to be the worst hit.

Authorities declared a state of emergency after some places received as much as 40 centimetres (16 inches) of rain over the weekend and on May 31.

The military helped evacuate more than 50 people including several who were airlifted to safety by helicopter.
