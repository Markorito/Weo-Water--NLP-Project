18171307708124190,"Western Oregon saw a rainy weekend, but not enough to make a difference at the Cascara Campground boat launch at Fall Creek State Recreation Site. This launch plus the North Shore and Winberry boat launches are all closed because of low water conditions. The boat launches at Lowell and Dexter state recreation sites on Dexter Reservoir are open.

Image description: A green, grassy area where there's normally reservoir water at this time of year. The boat launch and dock is close and the dock is on ground.

It's not about how tough you are or how much you love fishing, it's about preserving the future of our fisheries. We ought to be good stewards of our fisheries and do all we can to preserve them for future enjoyment. Giving up a few days of fishing now to help preserve better fishing days in the future is a small sacrifice. If you really can't go without fishing, then travel somewhere where it is much cooler.

17901253589016352,"The use of ollas can save a gardener time, energy, and water. Some also report that their vegetable gardens produce more lush plants with higher productivity.

So, how does it work?¬†

The principle is simple. A clay pot is buried with only the opening on top visible above the soil surface. It is then filled with water. The porous walls of the clay pot allow water to dissipate into the soil as needed.¬†

If the soil is dry, the water inside will release faster as the soil roots ‚Äúpull‚Äù it out. Likewise, if there is a recent saturating rainfall the water in the olla will remain until the surrounding soil dries.¬†

Did you know about this watering method? If not, will you be trying it out?¬†

17972502724403292,"FYI. Urgent. 
Check the sheep's eyes. The foxtails and pickers are unusually severe this year, stuck into the skin of their bellies even after the wool is off, making their eyes milky and threatening blindness. One could easily spend as much time tending eyes as shearing. 
FYI. Urgent.
Know and tell the age of the lambs. A ewe with a new lamb on her is the strongest there is, with hormonal changes and stress changing the nature of the wool, but more important still is: I will not advise you to take a newly nursing ewe off food and water for 10-12 hours lest she dry up.
FYI. Urgent.
It is late in the season. Fires have begun. Our bodies and equipment are damaged. Delays may. Wool is a breathable fiber on the sheep, and off. Shade and water, shade and water buy us all time.

17923559311652418,"Forecasters predict that by late summer Wyoming may have another rugged fire season. Some early fires are showing signs that those forecasts may be spot on. State Forester Bill Crapser joined us to discuss that and how they are planning to address things.

Bob Beck:¬†We're already starting to see some fires happening across the state. Anything there that gives you cause for concern?

Bill Crapser:¬†Right now we're a little bit ahead of where we were last year. So that's concerning the way last year turned out. Predictive Services, which is the interagency group that looks at fuels, weather, and predicts what they think is going to happen in the summer, they're saying that in June and July, most of the state will be in the high end of a normal fire season. But for August, they have the entire state in an above-average fire season. So we're pretty concerned about where we're going to be going this summer.
