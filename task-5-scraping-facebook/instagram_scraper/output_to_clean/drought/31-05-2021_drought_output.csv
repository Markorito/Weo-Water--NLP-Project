18114006064217314,"DOZENS OF ORLAND WELLS HAVE ALREADY DRIED UP

It is almost June, but dozens of wells in Orland are already dried up, leaving many without water.💦

ORLAND, Calif. - Many across Orland are asking one thing: where’s the water?
For one long-time farming family, they haven’t seen water levels this low in years.

👉“Our tank is empty,” Staci Buttermore said. “Absolutely done. We are now hauling water.”
But they are not alone.
Dozens in the area are experiencing the same problem: little to no water.
And many of them are afraid to even turn on their pumps, worrying they might burn them out.
As a result, many people are grabbing water from others, but they don’t know when that will run out either.
This means no water for showers, no water to drink, but most importantly, no water for the animals and the crop.
Besides being in a drought, Action News Now asked the Buttermore family about why they think this happened this year.📰
“It just really caught up with us,” Kassidi Buttermore explained. “We didn’t have anything in the reservoirs, and we haven’t had good recharge for the ground water for each individual piece of property. It was a perfect storm in a way.”😳
And farmers are just hoping to bring more attention to a bigger issue.
“I hope people don’t just think everybody is out for their own pocketbook,” Staci said. “People need to come to the table like adults. We need to have people tell both sides of the story but this state needs storage. I think there are ways parties can come together and keep our state sustainable and hopefully not a dust bowl.”
Well companies are saying they can’t come out to drill for months, leaving many not knowing when they will get water again.
🚜Farmers were also saying they are worried the lower levels of water will drive the cost of food up and bring employment in the agriculture industry down.

Photos by Pete McBride pedromcbride / Shortage: Lake Mead, the largest US reservoir, just saw its water level fall below 1075 feet (37% of full capacity) — a marker it has only dropped below a couple times since the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s. In the past, the lake recovered quickly after hitting that line. But now, thanks to ongoing drought and hotter and drier weather patterns, it is predicted to keep dropping through 2022, with few signs of recovery — triggering the first-ever water shortage declaration on the Colorado River. Years ago, I followed the river source to sea for a book about this over-loved, over-allocated lifeline and was shocked to see the river run dry before reaching the sea. It was a stark reminder of what happens when we ask too much of limited resources: They disappear. Today, this water supply continues to shrink, and yet we keep asking it to provide more. For more on water, follow pedromcbride. #water #CORiver #drought #nature #aerial 📸 by #PeteMcBride",1,3,IMAGE,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/193783595_951102149053299_6522456773511227716_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=L4dRwoXVy9cAX8JM7Ig&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=8a6dba3b8131c71ebb786101cfc92080&oe=60BA9BDE,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPiwPflJ5vE/,2021-05-31T15:52:06+0000,

17892680624144481,"The difference between the Briedenhann farm and the adjacent property is clearer than the light of day. Separated by a fence, you can see an abundance of grass on the left, compared to a wall of invasive bush species on the right.
 
“Bush encroachment was a serious problem on our farm. After moving here, we used herbicides on three thousand hectares and are still dealing with the repercussions more than 30 years later. Believe me when I say it’s a mistake I will never make again. All biodiversity and valuable palatable grasses were replaced by the invasive sickle bush. Now we are left with a total imbalance in biodiversity,” Koos says.

Dichrostachys cinerea, or more commonly known as ‘sickle bush’, is a thorny shrub and invasive bush species. It is known for its ability to regenerate from seeds and root buds that result in bush encroachment.
Learning from mistakes made many decades ago, the Briedenhann’s decided to deal with bush thickening on their farm by removing the matured bushes, utilising the younger bush, and keeping all the big trees for shading, which is especially important in  sunny Namibia.

Zero-budget natural farming in the drought-prone regions of Andhra Pradesh is helping the soil to produce more, offering smallholder farmers decent livelihoods. Farmers' organizations together with the government provide the training. They encourage local communities, particularly women’s self-help groups, to take up new farming practices that transform the land. The practices make farmers more resilient and able to fight climate change. Only when we invest in green recovery, we can build a sustainable future.

17856766919521375,"Rain in Taiwan has finally brought some much needed drought alleviation. At Lotus Pond in Kaohsiung, birds, bats, and bugs were having a feeding frenzy along the pond banks. Here, a  Black-Crowned Night Heron rests on a dock railing as the lights from one of the pagodas light up the water behind it.

17902464850958739,"Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced (Brannen, 2017). “By the year 2050, according to a 2014 MIT study, there will also be 5 billion people living in water-stressed areas.” (Brannen, 2017)

By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl* ever was (Cook et al., 2014). The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China (Romm, 2015). Meaning, the suppliers of much of the world’s food will not be reliable sources anymore.

Drought and crops go hand in hand. The basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent (Battisti and Naylor, 2009). Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them (Wallace-Wells, 2017).

Theoretically, the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature. But the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — meaning even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity (Battisti and Naylor, 2009).

It is not as easy as simply moving croplands north. Yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there (Wallace-Wells, 2017). It takes about 1,000 years for three centimeters of topsoil to form (FAO, 2019). As professor David Battisti said: “Pretty much all the arable land worth farming is already being farmed, so I’m not sure you can say where to go.” (Wallace-Wells, 2017)

17870445545421014,"The water dropped enough for us to move the girls to a higher paddock. Due to the drought, we have been really tight on pasture and therefor paddock options. 
We were trying to give this paddock time to kick into gear so we could use it for lambing - but you can’t lamb drowned sheep, so it’s into the ‘lush’ (lol not really!) for these girls.
