This segment was on the state of water in California, big ag, and almonds!  Almond farming takes 80% of the potable water in California, and supplies about the same percentage of the world‚Äôs almond supply. However, almonds ARE grown in other places that HAVE adequate rainfall.

Residents are getting restrictions while almond farming mega corporations, along with Nestle and Coke are stealing the water that is owned by the residents of California, putting it in plastic bottles and selling it back to the residents at an incredible profit. 

Look how much water it takes to grow a pound of strawberries as compared to a pound of almonds.

California is burning while almond growers are continuing to get rich, rape the land, and use tons of pesticides in the process.

Maher says if Coal miners are being forced to retrain into other jobs that won‚Äôt kill people, so can almond farmers be. 

I agree. 

I haven‚Äôt bought almonds in years, but I admit to buying almond butter whenever I see it on sale.  It is anti-inflammatory, and a main ingredient in some of my best selling fermented snacks, but I will no longer buy it from California.  There are other things that are anti-inflammatory and don‚Äôt take such a heavy toll on the the ecosystem.

Meteorologists say the risk of another destructive wildfire season is very high for much of the western US this year. Drought affects about 90% of the West, and the current heatwave has exacerbated the situation, increasing the amount of ""fuel"" for wildfires. At least 33 wildfires are blazing across ten states even before the start of summer.

Lake Oroville has been drained so low that's its predicted it will not be able to generate hydro power at all by august it normally produces full power to 800,000 homes Oroville is the 2nd largest reservoir of the state of California and has the tallest dam in the u.s. 
Currently the water level at Oroville is hovering around 700 feet above sea level  when it reaches around 640 ft it will be shut off 
Similar situations are playing out for lake mead &Hoover dam they produce power for 8 million
If you get power from these areas do you have a back up power plan ?

17920902664725408,,"The government of #Chile and the National Geographic Society are going to new heights in a search for answers about the 11-year #drought plaguing the central part of the country. With the Ministry of #Agriculture declaring emergencies in over 50 municipalities, the toll is clear, yet the meteorological factors behind the megadrought remain shrouded in mystery. 

So with a little help from luxury watchmaker rolex, insidenatgeo teamed up with Chile‚Äôs Ministry of Public Works on a mission to install a weather station on the highest mountain in the #Andes: the dormant Tupungato Volcano. 

Based on their experience launching similar projects on Mount Everest, the team knew the #weather station had to be durable enough to withstand high winds, but light enough to be carried up the mountain and assembled on site. Deep snow and pandemic protocols presented logistical challenges, but the team pulled it off.

Now it‚Äôs all about collecting #data‚Äîgetting near-real-time reads on temperature, humidity, moisture, barometric pressure and solar radiation. As it‚Äôs collected, data will be transmitted to monitoring facilities, with researchers and Chilean officials aiming to collect data over multiple seasons to understand how glaciers and the snow in water towers like Tupungato respond to #climatechange. And that info, in turn, will help improve forecasting models.

The ultimate goal? ‚ÄúSupport and elevate solutions that can help restore balance to our ecosystems,‚Äù said Nicole Alexiev, vice president, #science and #innovation, National Geographic Society.

In fact flows are lower now than they were in 2014 when the river disconnected in the fall and left migrating Chinook suffering from elevated levels of disease.
