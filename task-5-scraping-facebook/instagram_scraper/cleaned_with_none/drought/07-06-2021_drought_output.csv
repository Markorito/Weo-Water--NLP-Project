17888682539205318,"The bees are very slowly making their way back to the garden. This 2nd year drought is devastating. North Dakota is in DIRE need of moisture.  The farmers are in trouble, their fields are bone dry and they are struggling to feed their cattle. I had a moment last night, I was upset, sad, and anxious. My garden is looking like junk, I've lost so many plants this spring, the lack of snow this winter left everything exposed to the subzero temps and no rain this spring didn't help at all. My garden is my hobby.... it isn't my income maker. Please pray for the farmer's in our state, for the stress and anxiety they are facing. Please pray for rain.

17909102596794129,"Here are four facts you should know as we once again battle California wildfire season:
üî• 41 of 58 of California‚Äôs counties are in a state of drought emergency as the state continues to fall deeper into drought. This means more dry land, and potential for more wildfires.
üî• Fire season has already begun. There have already been nearly 2,800 wildfires, with nearly 16,000 acres burned since the first of the year. This is an extremely early start for fire season, as less than 2,400 acres had burned by this time last year. Experts believe that as temperatures continue to rise and droughts sustain, parts of California will be in fire season year-round.
üî• Cal Fire has hired nearly 1,400 new seasonal firefighters to combat the increased demand. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing an additional $38.9 million to staff current and additional Cal Fire crews.
üî• Newsom also proposed an additional $2 billion to combat the fires this year, which would be the largest wildfire budget ever proposed by a governor, saying ‚ÄúClimate change has created a new wildfire reality in California.‚Äù

Luckily, communities are hard at work, planning recycled water projects that can transform our state‚Äôs water supply

But we need your help. We‚Äôre asking you to include $750 million for recycled water in the drought package‚Ä¶this will ensure California‚Äôs water future, create jobs, and support our environment and economy‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs only the beginning.

It is time to invest in new drought tolerant water supplies for our State... and the time to address the problem is now.

Furthermore, as total precipitation for the year remains far below seasonal averages, there is growing confidence for drought conditions to persist into the foreseeable future. 

From the air, it is more difficult to see the impacts of drought, especially in its early stages. At the surface, many farmers are beginning to quietly hope and pray for a change in the weather pattern.

‚Äã
1) ‚ÄãStart at home by conserving your water usage... take shorter showers and turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or doing the dishes. ¬†And as much as we like green grass, be aware of how much water is being used outside!
‚Äã
‚Äã2) If you are looking to get out on the water and fish this summer, enact your own hoot owl... get out early and end early. ¬†Our fisheries will be stressed so be extra kind to the fish and #keepthemwet.
‚Äã
‚ÄãMaking small changes can make all the difference for our water systems in Montana!
