17954515396445773,"In response to worsening #drought conditions in #California, today the Department of Water Resources (DWR) began construction on a temporary emergency drought barrier on the West False River in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The barrier will help slow the movement of saltwater into the central Delta and prevent contamination of #water supplies for Delta agriculture and municipal supplies for millions of Californians.

‚ÄúCalifornia is experiencing a second consecutive dry year and snowpack runoff into our state reservoirs has been far less than anticipated, so we are taking emergency actions to protect the state‚Äôs water supply and environment now,‚Äù said DWR Director Karla Nemeth. ‚ÄúDWR along with partner agencies is looking at all options to bolster the state‚Äôs drought response and mitigate drought impacts.‚Äù

The barrier will help prevent saltwater contamination of water supplies used by millions of Californians who rely on Delta-based federal and state water projects for at least some of their supplies. The #emergency barrier will also help conserve critical water supplies in upstream reservoirs for later use by avoiding the need to send large volumes of water into the Delta to repel salinity this summer.

‚ÄúKeeping saltwater from intruding into the central Delta is essential as a large portion of the state‚Äôs fresh water for urban and agricultural use goes through this part of the Delta,‚Äù said Ted Craddock, Deputy Director for the State Water Project.

On June 1, a temporary urgency change petition to modify State Water Project and Central Valley Project water rights conditions was approved by the State Water Resources Control Board, which will allow for water to be conserved for later instream uses and water quality requirements. These modifications are needed to help protect cold water pools for salmon and steelhead and maintain water quality while ensuring some water supplies are maintained if drought conditions persist next year.

They originally got excited about riding the Divide after our Monumental Talk with andreafromiowa (Hi, Andrea.  Everyone here still thinks you‚Äôre super cool.) 

Tonight was play time.  Cool and cloudy with some mostly mellow riding.  A little bit of the Gravalerxs magic, chaos and camaraderie, came back on this one. 

Thanks y‚Äôall.

The Department of Water Resources projects the lake will dip below its record low of 646 feet sometime in August or September. If that happens, the state will have to close the boat ramps for the first time ever because of low water levels.‚Å†

this year will be a heated theme.

Without H2O none of us would be here in a physical form. Water carries e~motions and it is interesting to see how the ‚Äòdrought‚Äô may correlate to the ‚Äòinner drought within humanity‚Äô that is needed to be felt, in order to change.

What feelings are we not in touch with? 

What are you using water for?

Growing lawn?
Non native high water usage plants?
Washing your car?

We all have people living ‚Äòdown river‚Äô from us.

Holding a enhanced capacity of ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô into how water nourishes nature closes the gap of receiving and giving.

As much as I love many plants, I support native plants the most. My mullein is thriving for example, with little to no extra water. So do the belly flowers... and my dogwood.

I have fountains and many water bowls for birds and other wildlife: deer, bobcats, bears, snakes, squirrels and chipmunks are frequent visitors to these holy places.

It has become an energetic oasis and sanctuary for them to come and be.

We are being asked to awaken. Ascending into higher planes of consciousness is by becoming aware in a harmonious ways of ALL there is. Being intuitive, having crystals and saying ‚Äòhip new age words‚Äô is not at all enough.

How are you with Mother Earth? 
Do you notice where you step your feet?
Are there little bugs? Or a tiny trying plant üå± on the road?

May your inner ‚Äòwaters‚Äô move you into unity and harmony to create a new balanced way for those of us who choose to live and experience the beauty and love there is.

And in my universe~ bubble it already is... 

With so much gratitude for each living plant and creature, to bless us with their harmonious non -destructive way of being.
May we remember and learn from them.

18167046496134933,"The last three years, Southwest Utah hasn‚Äôt had a monsoon season. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar, the Southwest US typically experiences monsoons in July and August. These are big thunder storms that build during summer heat and deposit LOTS of moisture in a short amount of time. The storms are powerful and fierce. Slot canyons and washes fill and flash flood. The last few seasons summers have gotten hotter and we legitimately haven‚Äôt had a monsoon season in years. Last summer we had a grand total of one thunderstorm in St George proper. And in tandem with this we see more frequent and more severe wildfires. Last summer there were at least five significant fires that were very real threats to residential areas in our town. This spring there have been a number of major fires IN town already. So this is all to say this is probably going to keep trending this way and climate change is real. Fight me.

17909339095872934,"A throwback to one of our 1976 mailers. After the 1970s drought, Marin Water worked to increase your water supply and prepare for future droughts by:
‚Ä¢ Building a direct pipeline to the Sonoma Water system and its Russian River source was built. We now receive 25 percent of our water through this pipeline.
‚Ä¢ Developing a successful partnership with Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District provides recycled water to a portion of our district, saving potable water for essential uses.
‚Ä¢ Doubling Kent Lake‚Äôs capacity in 1983.
‚Ä¢ Adding Soulajule Reservoir to our system as a seventh reservoir, increasing capacity. 
‚Ä¢ Putting a state-of-the-art water leak detection team in place.
‚Ä¢ Developing programs and incentives, including rebates on things like lawn replacements, graywater systems and ""smart"" irrigation controllers; we also provide free water-efficient fixtures for our customers.
