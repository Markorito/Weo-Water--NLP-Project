Sometimes we find ourselves outside of our ideal. Our situations be it spiritual, emotional, or physical don‚Äôt measure up to what we once thought was necessary for growth. But, like the cactus, our lives have purpose even when the ground we stand in is lacking some important things.

17924232421629627,"Dangerously hot temperatures gripping parts of the Western U.S. will continue to smash records as the week comes to a close.

üî• A large dome of high pressure in the upper atmosphere¬†has developed over the West.
Beneath the dome, sinking air is causing temperatures to soar well over 100 degrees in many areas.
Heat alerts have been issued by the National Weather Service for various time periods this week, from parts of the Southwest into the Great Basin and California.

üö© Records have already been broken in this heat wave and more are likely to fall in the days ahead, from the Central Rockies into the Desert Southwest and California.
Salt Lake City tied its all-time record high for any day of the year yesterday when it hit 107 degrees.
That followed daily record highs on Sunday (102 degrees) and Monday (103 degrees).
Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Sacramento are some of the cities that could set at least daily record highs through late this week.

‚ö†Ô∏è Outdoor activities should be limited in these areas because of the possibility of heat-related illnesses.
The core of the heat will be most persistent in the Southwest, but it will also affect parts of the Great Basin and Rockies.
It will spread into California's central valley for the end of the week.
Wildfire concerns will also be elevated this week because of the hot temperatures in combination with long-term drought conditions in place across a large part of the West.

17887628324250817,"There is a extreme drought in Utah. There is a fire restriction across Southwest Utah and Northern Arizona. No campfires are allowed. So far this year there have been 326 wildfires in Utah, of which, 42 started in just the last week. 90% of the fires are human caused, and have lead to 12,000 acres burned. The low humidity in the air and the lack of rain or moisture on the ground makes it easy for wildfires to spread. There is no rain in the forecast. The Southwest relies on 2 major reservoirs on the Colorado River to keep water flowing to Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Temperatures are increasing due to climate change which produces much more evaporation, more loss of water from the reservoirs, a greater demand for water in agricultural systems that use water for crops. Even without factoring in less rain,  you would expect more water scarcity in the future. Although, I saw rain clouds there was nothing but a light drizzle lasting only a few minutes during this hike. I guess, Smoky Bear was right, when he said ‚ÄúOnly you can prevent forest fires.‚Äù #drought #utah #thewave #thewavearizona",0,4,IMAGE,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/201243935_1217439798700372_3475569037821837274_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=0dRIcLKpU60AX-yhwRi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=b9c3ba990c7c814cf2ea6254ef903217&oe=60CE430C,https://www.instagram.com/p/CQL2V-ND-UQ/,2021-06-16T14:54:17+0000,,drought
17875070381360195,"NEWS RELEASE: Wax proves key to protecting crops from #drought and #frost
usask researchers used the CLS to show that cuticular wax‚Äîa waxy layer that covers exterior surfaces of plants, much like human skin‚Äîprovides a barrier against low temperatures and dehydration.
The ultimate goal of the research is to provide plant breeders with information that enables them to more efficiently select superior #genetic lines and develop more resilient #crops as environmental conditions get more unpredictable, according to Dr. Karen Tanino agbiousask.
The team used our #MidIR beamline to study plant leaves to the depth of two microns (two millionths of a meter), which provided information on the quantity and quality of the surface wax. In a recently published paper, the team argues that the best way to keep #plants from freezing is by selecting waxy varieties. 

This research was funded by nserc_crsng, skgov, and #SaskWheat.

17921198671672310,"Finally, Something Positive For The Wildlife In The NW U.S! 

Many species have been under attack, literally, in western State's like Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. But Washington is stepping up and trying to protect their wildlife! Two Spokane-city lawmakers are advocating for a statewide ban on wildlife feeding to help protect the black bears in the State. 

Most of Washington state is currently under a drought advisory, with March and April being the fourth driest period on record for the state since 1895. Kile Westerman, a wildlife conflict specialist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said, they believe as a result from this, the food source available to the bears is ""less than ideal"" which means the bears have to go searching farther and are getting into more urban areas. While feeding bears is illegal, feeding deer and other wildlife is allowed in most of Washington. But bears will be bears, and when food is scarce they are opportunistic. As we know, this puts a target on the bears.

Councilwomen Lori Kinnear and Candace Mumm are planning to add a statewide wildlife feeding ban to the city's Washington State Legislative wish list. When the Legislature starts its 2022 session, Spokane's representative will advocate for some sort of wildlife feeding ban. This will eliminate many areas of concern, including human-bear conflict, the spread of chronic waste disease and the habituation of wild animals.

Hm, well, anyway! Look at the full grown individuals and the awesome flowers. Maybe we could just keep those and cherish what we have and plant other cool stuff like hickories and redwoods and smoke trees and nettle trees and cedars and so on and so forth.

Anyway, this tree is still useful for its durable wood and its also rot-resistant so maybe its not that surprising that this tree is common in central europe as a timber production tree. And its actually also very good for stabilizing soils with erosion problems. 

Plant it - or Don‚Äôt, I just love it right now!

As this unusually dry year continues, well over half the state is currently in a high üî•  danger zone, according to wi_dnr.

What are conditions like where you live?

17913551287830394,"I remember when we first purchased the orchard we would have 5 gallon buckets of cherries! Unfortunately, our cherry trees were sick when we bought the new place and it took us a couple of years to get it under control and most of the cherries died. Between that, this horrendous drought and fire blight, I‚Äôm trying to think of new ways forward for the orchard, as it seems it‚Äôs screaming that it‚Äôs time to adapt. Perhaps there are new opportunities?ü§î

PS this is not a call for orchard management advice unless you have some revolutionary ideas about how to move forward.

18114959143223318,"It was a beautiful Spring here in Salt Lake City...birds were singing, mothers were milking and the air had a crispness to it that refreshed the soul while still allowing for blossoming flowers and trees. 

That was then and this is now. 

Now it's hot as hell...apologies to any Mormon, Christian or other conservative groups who take offense to that word. 

Stepping out of one's apartment, you're immediately transported to magically locations such as Beirut, Phoenix, Tel Aviv, Death Valley or the surface of the sun. 

That crispness I eluded to earlier has now been replaced by stifled convection oven breezes that will not only give the allergenic and asthmatic fits but will also motivate an individual to reconsider job opportunities in Alaska. 

And with Summer not even here yet at least according to the Gregorian Calendar, it's gonna be hot, it's gonna be long and it's gonna be rough. 

Summertime and I have never really jived which is much to my chagrin considering most people thrive in the summer and enjoy the leisure lifestyle  of the beach or camping up in the mountains. 

Maybe the 12 Summers I spent in Phoenix ruined the season for me or perhaps even further back, the long August days and nights in New York where central air conditioning had still not been invented yet and you were forced to sweat it out sandwiched between cotton sheets. 

Springtime...I'll miss you and from what I saw this year, you and I will get along just fine here in Salt Lake. 

Summertime...go easy on me man...go easy on us all as pretty much the Western third of the U.S. is experiencing the longest and worst drought conditions ever thanks to your ultraviolet rays and scarce precipitation. 

I'd say you suck and throw more derogatory names at you but I'm sure you would simply come back at me with a 115 degree heat wave. 

Summertime you win...I yield to your will and ask for mercy or at least a drenching thunderstorm.
