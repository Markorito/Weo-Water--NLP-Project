17868756476444384,"Over the past few days, rainfall in different parts of the park has resulted in flashfloods in several drainages including Terlingua and Tornillo Creek. 

And it appears we could be in for more! The National Weather Service is forecasting a decent chance of thunderstorms for the coming week. 
This photo was taken at the bridge that crosses Tornillo Creek on the road to Rio Grande Village. This normally dry wash was roaring with water after only 1 inch of rainfall. 

Dirt roads, as well as paved roads that cross low drainages, can become impassable after seemingly insignificant amounts of rain. Narrow canyons can quickly flood with water and trap unsuspecting hikers. When visiting the park this time of year, it is important to pay attention to the weather and be prepared to change your plans if storms are in the area. 
Just because it's not raining on your head doesn't mean it isn't raining somewhere upstream from you!

Mesmerizing, isn‚Äôt it? But very dangerous. This amount of water can easily knock someone off their feet, or float a car off the road. It only takes 6‚Äù of flowing water to sweep a car off the pavement.

HQ Staffer Jamie Verzwyvelt took this slo-motion video after the storm at Devil‚Äôs Waterhole

The park received around 2 inches of rain in about an hour!

Many low-lying sections of trails may be underwater, and the rocks are very slippery when wet, so today may be more of a relax-at-camp day, than exploring the hiking trails.

Stay safe and Turn Around, Don‚Äôt Drown!
