17886232490256139,"11:30 a.m. Thursday-Joe Tanner Rd. at Williamson Creek. More than 100 low water crossings are closed around the area according to www.atxfloods.com. More will likely close soon.

If you come to a flooded low water crossing, find another way around. Driving through it puts you in danger, along with the rescuers who may need to come save you if you get swept away.

I would like to tell you there is light at the end of the tunnel , but I can't.  Another week of rain predicted and,  If we get the rain they are calling for you will see major rivers and tributaries flood .  The San Gabriel river will jump its banks in Georgetown along with Brushy Creek luckily the lakes still have a ways to go before they are full and have the release water stay safe  Yall #turnarounddontdrown #atx #texas #texasisthebest #texasweather #atxweather #naderchasers #stormchaser #chaselife #flashflood",0,9,IMAGE,https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/195462635_477471560028204_4758617131862965030_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=Q86XxkjIZrsAX-Axa8G&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&oh=0fd805f7d1b9928782388b5f35726a0c&oe=60BEB24A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPp7blJpJN5/,2021-06-03T10:44:34+0000,,False
