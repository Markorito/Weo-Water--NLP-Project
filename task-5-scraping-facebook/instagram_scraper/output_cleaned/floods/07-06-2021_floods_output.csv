From our photo collection we have some images of a flood of Mason’s Creek around 1940. Mason’s Creek is a tributary of the Rancocas. The flood was so severe that it damaged the bridge near Creek Road and Marne Highway. #Rancocas #Creeks #Floods #BurlingtonCounty,0,2,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,https://www.instagram.com/p/CP03podNsb4/,2021-06-07T16:43:10+0000,,False
