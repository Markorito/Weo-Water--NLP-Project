17901139187003958,It rained hard this afternoon for about 40 minutes. I just went out for a walk to pick up wine before the dry weekend (you need to be sober for the elections). It looks like that might be difficult without flippers.

17928651361578560,"Climate shocks - floods, droughts, locusts, and other disasters - are driving more people from their homes and into hunger than ever before. Last year, South Sudan was hit by the worst flooding in 60 years, driving Nyagout and daughter Nyagoang, who was pregnant, out of their home and into an inadequate shelter.¬†

To help communities displaced by the floods, we launched an emergency response to provide food assistance, fishing kits, and seeds. We also constructed dykes to protect flood-prone areas.¬†

18178528405118092,"One hundred years ago today, one of the most tragic natural disasters to strike Colorado occurred in Pueblo when massive floods destroyed much of the town.

On Friday, June 3rd, 1921, a cloud burst brought torrential rain that swept down the Arkansas River damaging much of the town. The next day more rain came with an even bigger surge that put parts of Pueblo under 17 feet of water. By Sunday, the dam and levee on Beaver Creek, near Florence, burst causing a third surge of water through the town.

Official deaths were counted in the 100-200 person range, but it is estimated that 1500 people perished, as many disappeared, likely swept away and buried by the flood waters and mud. 

One of the hardest hit areas was near the Pueblo Union Station, where the railyards were left in a tangled mess. At the time of one of the surges, a few trains were loaded with passengers as the cars were swept downstream. There are debates in the newspapers from the time, if passengers were able to escape or not. And, if they escaped the car, were they just swept downstream to their deaths. 

Compounding the flood waters, several fires broke out. A lumber yard caught fire, and burning wood was swept downstream which caused fires to many other buildings and homes. The fire department could not help due to the height of the flood.

A year later, it was estimated the floods caused over $20 million in damages ($300 million in todays dollars). A few newspapers compared the destruction of Pueblo to the destruction of San Francisco from the earthquake of 1906.
