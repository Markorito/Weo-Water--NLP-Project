17873299724501484,,"Hundreds of people have had to leave their homes as parts of New Zealand are hit with what has been described as a one-in-100-year deluge.

300 homes had to be evacuated overnight in the province of Canterbury in the country's South Island as this area seems to be the worst hit.

Authorities declared a state of emergency after some places received as much as 40 centimetres (16 inches) of rain over the weekend and on May 31.

The military helped evacuate more than 50 people including several who were airlifted to safety by helicopter.
