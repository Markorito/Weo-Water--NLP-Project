17917488415702043,"CDC urges local gov‚Äôt bodies to put disaster response systems, training into action
newsroomgy

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) is re-emphasizing the responsibility of Neighbourhood Democratic Councils, Community Development Councils, Village Councils and Regional Democratic Councils in conducting assessments and reporting and providing support to residents affected by floods and other natural hazards.

Continuous flooding in communities across Guyana has reinforced the need for these bodies to utilise the training and plans provided by the CDC over the years.

The CDC, with support from the UNDP and IDB was able to improve the National Disaster Risk Management System (DRM) which has the Regional Disaster Risk Management Systems as critical components. This allowed each region to develop its own DRM system in keeping with the wider national mechanism. Plans and systems have been developed and implemented in all ten administrative regions.
