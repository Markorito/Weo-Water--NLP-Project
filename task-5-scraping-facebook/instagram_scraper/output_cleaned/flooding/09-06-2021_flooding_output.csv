17856643331564635,"It‚Äôs been an eventful few days here. Sunday night, we had torrential downpour and very strong winds that went on for hours, amounting in 12 inches of rain. It was unreal. The angle and strength of the wind caused rain to come in through our outdoor shower, stove hood vent, and all the windows on one side of our camper. It also broke one of our gutters. Compared to others, our damage was pretty minimal. The entire campground is flooded, roads are washed out, etc. I didn‚Äôt take many pics because it felt wrong when there were people all around us who had lost so much. But in the first pic, you can see wayyyy down there where the dock is‚Äîthat‚Äôs where the water line typically is. üò≥ As far as I know, everyone around us is safe, and stuff can be replaced, so we‚Äôre taking it in stride and viewing it as an educational experience and part of the journey!
