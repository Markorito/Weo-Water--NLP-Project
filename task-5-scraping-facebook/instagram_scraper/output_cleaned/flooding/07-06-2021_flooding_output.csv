18155108518092326,"Dear park patrons and adventure seekers: Most parks in #Plano generally remain open, but people entering parks in flood plain areas and creeks should be properly attired and use extreme caution. Some wildlife has also been displaced, so please look out for snakes and other animals. Also, mowing or any work requiring large or heavy equipment on turf or in natural areas may be delayed due to wet conditions. 
Thank you for your patience, and stay safe! ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†

18075251869281892,"Dear friends and colleagues, Guyana is currently experiencing the most horrible flood in the decade. 

Many people have been forced to evacuate their homes and businesses, due to rising water levels and wild species. For example, large Anacondas are found in people's homes and public spaces just outside of Georgetown, Guyana.

The globalpaintforcharity is currently working in partnership with the US Army and other humanitarian organizations to deploy disaster assistance to the victims in #Guyana, #Venezuela, #Honduras, El #Salvador and #Guatemala. 

We hope to soon have additional information, on how best to support the victims in the region. But help is needed, this is a great opportunity to show your support and contributions. 
Please visit www.globalpaints.org/emergency-relief to help us assist families in underserved communities. Our team begins to join efforts and provide brief support and safety but more help is needed.
Thank you so much for your continued support and contributions.
