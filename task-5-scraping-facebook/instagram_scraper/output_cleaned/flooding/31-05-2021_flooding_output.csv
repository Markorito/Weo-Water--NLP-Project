18218468479066155,"More than 96,000 hectares of agricultural land has been inundated in eastern India due to a powerful storm this week, a year after a super cyclone ravaged the coastal region.

Cyclone Yaas swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday, triggering storm surges that broke through embankments in West Bengal state, mainly hitting the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans delta that stretches into neighbouring Bangladesh.

The storm has left more than 150,000 people homeless in eastern India and Bangladesh.
With climate change pushing up sea surface temperatures, the cyclonic storms that barrel in from the Bay of Bengal have become more aggressive and frequent, particularly in the last decade, according to researchers.

17873299724501484,"Hundreds of people have had to leave their homes as parts of New Zealand are hit with what has been described as a one-in-100-year deluge.

300 homes had to be evacuated overnight in the province of Canterbury in the country's South Island as this area seems to be the worst hit.

Authorities declared a state of emergency after some places received as much as 40 centimetres (16 inches) of rain over the weekend and on May 31.

The military helped evacuate more than 50 people including several who were airlifted to safety by helicopter.
