17887628324250817,"There is a extreme drought in Utah. There is a fire restriction across Southwest Utah and Northern Arizona. No campfires are allowed. So far this year there have been 326 wildfires in Utah, of which, 42 started in just the last week. 90% of the fires are human caused, and have lead to 12,000 acres burned. The low humidity in the air and the lack of rain or moisture on the ground makes it easy for wildfires to spread. There is no rain in the forecast. The Southwest relies on 2 major reservoirs on the Colorado River to keep water flowing to Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Temperatures are increasing due to climate change which produces much more evaporation, more loss of water from the reservoirs, a greater demand for water in agricultural systems that use water for crops. Even without factoring in less rain,  you would expect more water scarcity in the future. Although, I saw rain clouds there was nothing but a light drizzle lasting only a few minutes during this hike. I guess, Smoky Bear was right, when he said ‚ÄúOnly you can prevent forest fires.‚Äù #drought #utah #thewave #thewavearizona",0,4,IMAGE,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/201243935_1217439798700372_3475569037821837274_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=0dRIcLKpU60AX-yhwRi&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=b9c3ba990c7c814cf2ea6254ef903217&oe=60CE430C,https://www.instagram.com/p/CQL2V-ND-UQ/,2021-06-16T14:54:17+0000,,False

17888334047255138,"Black Locust! Its time for this beauty to show off. Black Lotus (Robinia pseudoacacia) is considered invasive in most countries and hasn‚Äôt the best reputation here as well. Been reading articles with titles like ‚ÄùRobinias, are they really that bad‚Äù and ‚ÄùA love affair gone away -why I won‚Äôt plant Robinia pseudoacacia in my garden again‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Hm, well, anyway! Look at the full grown individuals and the awesome flowers. Maybe we could just keep those and cherish what we have and plant other cool stuff like hickories and redwoods and smoke trees and nettle trees and cedars and so on and so forth.

Anyway, this tree is still useful for its durable wood and its also rot-resistant so maybe its not that surprising that this tree is common in central europe as a timber production tree. And its actually also very good for stabilizing soils with erosion problems. 

Plant it - or Don‚Äôt, I just love it right now!
