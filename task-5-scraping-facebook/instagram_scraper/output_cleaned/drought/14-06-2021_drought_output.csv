18171307708124190,"Western Oregon saw a rainy weekend, but not enough to make a difference at the Cascara Campground boat launch at Fall Creek State Recreation Site. This launch plus the North Shore and Winberry boat launches are all closed because of low water conditions. The boat launches at Lowell and Dexter state recreation sites on Dexter Reservoir are open.

17923559311652418,"Forecasters predict that by late summer Wyoming may have another rugged fire season. Some early fires are showing signs that those forecasts may be spot on. State Forester Bill Crapser joined us to discuss that and how they are planning to address things.

Bob Beck:¬†We're already starting to see some fires happening across the state. Anything there that gives you cause for concern?

Bill Crapser:¬†Right now we're a little bit ahead of where we were last year. So that's concerning the way last year turned out. Predictive Services, which is the interagency group that looks at fuels, weather, and predicts what they think is going to happen in the summer, they're saying that in June and July, most of the state will be in the high end of a normal fire season. But for August, they have the entire state in an above-average fire season. So we're pretty concerned about where we're going to be going this summer.
