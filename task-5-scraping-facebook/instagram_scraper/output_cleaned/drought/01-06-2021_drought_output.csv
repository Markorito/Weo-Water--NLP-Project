18173532187139969,,"""I'm seeing probably the worst combination of conditions in my lifetime,"" said Derrick DeGroot, a county commissioner in southern Oregon's Klamath County. ""We have an enormous fuel load in the forests, and we are looking at a drought unlike we've seen probably in the last 115 years.""

Asked how worried he is about the 2021 fire season, DeGroot said: ""On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 12. Nothing looks good.""

17938980316518466,,"Meteorological Spring (March through May) is in the record books. Here's how we did across the eastern Carolinas:

Nearly record breaking low rainfall totals completely erased our winter rainfall surplus and plunged us into a moderate drought.  This spring's daily high temperatures were warmer than normal, but nighttime lows were cooler than normal in most locations.  Large day-to-night swings in temperature are more common when skies are consistently clear -- one of the major reasons we saw such little rain over the past few months.

18108475906245500,,"New pump cart is working great. Much nicer than lugging the pump in and out of the back of the UTV. This rig will stay setup like this with 300 gallons of water waiting on it at all times. This allows us to easily refill pasture holding tanks or pump over whey tanks to the hogs. In a pinch it can double as a portable fire fighting rig. Hopefully it never comes to that, but I'm definitely more worried this year than I have been in the past.
