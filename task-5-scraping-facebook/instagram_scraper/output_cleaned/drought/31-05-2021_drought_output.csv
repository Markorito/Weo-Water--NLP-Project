Photos by Pete McBride pedromcbride / Shortage: Lake Mead, the largest US reservoir, just saw its water level fall below 1075 feet (37% of full capacity) ‚Äî a marker it has only dropped below a couple times since the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s. In the past, the lake recovered quickly after hitting that line. But now, thanks to ongoing drought and hotter and drier weather patterns, it is predicted to keep dropping through 2022, with few signs of recovery ‚Äî triggering the first-ever water shortage declaration on the Colorado River. Years ago, I followed the river source to sea for a book about this over-loved, over-allocated lifeline and was shocked to see the river run dry before reaching the sea. It was a stark reminder of what happens when we ask too much of limited resources: They disappear. Today, this water supply continues to shrink, and yet we keep asking it to provide more. For more on water, follow pedromcbride. #water #CORiver #drought #nature #aerial üì∏ by #PeteMcBride",1,3,IMAGE,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/193783595_951102149053299_6522456773511227716_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=L4dRwoXVy9cAX8JM7Ig&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=8a6dba3b8131c71ebb786101cfc92080&oe=60BA9BDE,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPiwPflJ5vE/,2021-05-31T15:52:06+0000,,False

17902464850958739,"Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced (Brannen, 2017). ‚ÄúBy the year 2050, according to a 2014 MIT study, there will also be 5 billion people living in water-stressed areas.‚Äù (Brannen, 2017)

By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl* ever was (Cook et al., 2014). The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China (Romm, 2015). Meaning, the suppliers of much of the world‚Äôs food will not be reliable sources anymore.

Drought and crops go hand in hand. The basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent (Battisti and Naylor, 2009). Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them (Wallace-Wells, 2017).

Theoretically, the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature. But the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature ‚Äî meaning even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity (Battisti and Naylor, 2009).

It is not as easy as simply moving croplands north. Yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there (Wallace-Wells, 2017). It takes about 1,000 years for three centimeters of topsoil to form (FAO, 2019). As professor David Battisti said: ‚ÄúPretty much all the arable land worth farming is already being farmed, so I‚Äôm not sure you can say where to go.‚Äù (Wallace-Wells, 2017)
