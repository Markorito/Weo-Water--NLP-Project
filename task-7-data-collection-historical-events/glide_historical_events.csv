The temperatures over the last couple of months have also been higher than normal. Early spring precipitation has so far not been enough to redress the imbalance, and only very good late spring/early summer rains will do so. The conditions for soil moisture and irrigation are at an alarming level. The current lack of precipitation and soil moisture will not only affect winter and spring-planted crops, but also the planting of the main crop to be harvested in September. With the current agricultural conditions, millions of people are at risk of malnutrition. Any threat to food security will have a serious effect on an already stressed population in terms of food availability and the risk of increased malnutrition, which will affect the most vulnerable sectors of the affected population: children, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, and those with underlying illnesses.

Forecasts issued by The Meteorological Services Department of Zimbabwe (MSDZ) indicate that the country will experience tropical cyclone-type rainfall starting from Thursday 16 up to Monday 20 February 2017. The tropical cyclone is a serious threat and will be preceded by very strong and damaging winds followed by extreme flooding. The humanitarian impact of Tropical Cyclone DINEO threatens to be massive as projections shows that it will bring widespread torrential rain and damaging winds which can reach as high as 160km/hr. This will likely trigger flash floods which threaten human lives, animals and destruction assets and infrastructure. More than half of the country's dams are overpilling and this could exacerbate flooding resulting displacement of people and increasing the incidence of both water borne and vector diseases. "

The decision was announced following a meeting of the Technical Council for Disaster Management and seeks to intensify the Government's monitoring and readiness actions to address the potential impacts of flooding and cyclonic events during the disaster season. The ?Orange Alert? is released in parallel to the ongoing ?Red Alert? issued in 2016 for the southern and central regions of the country to address the effects of the food insecurity situation brought on by the 2015/16 El-Niño induced drought. At present, four river basins--Buzi and Pungue in the central region and Mutamba and Inhanombe in the southern region?are at ?alert? level and are expected to breach within the next 72 hours.

The fact that these were low-lying areas, the soil's saturation and the presence of crevices in basins (the most important in Argentina) caused by the constant rainfall throughout the year led to significant flooding and overflows from rivers and streams. The localities affected in this province by this emergency in this period were not affected by the rainy season in 2015 and 2016. Pergamino, a city in northern Buenos Aires province was one of the most affected by the rainfall, receiving some 220 millimetres of water in 4 hours, causing the Pergamino Stream, its tributaries and effluents, such as Chu Creek, to overflow. This led to flooding throughout the city, which is organized into 24 urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods. The flooding, mainly impacted riverside neighbourhoods (the river cuts across the city) such as 9 de Julio, Cueto, Centenario, Tocha, San Vicente, Kennedy, Centro, 27 de Noviembre, Belgrano, Martín M. de G?emes and José Hernández (the latter three are considered informal settlements); and Jorge Newbery (also an informal settlement) along Chu Creek, affecting 13,650 people, i.e. around 11 per cent of the total population. Basic services such as power, telephony, internet and water were partially interrupted for some 36 hours (completely in affected neighbourhoods), and some stretches of National Routes 8 and 9 (the main access roads to Pergamino) were blocked completely by flooding, making it difficult to mobilize assistance from outside of the city. More than 3,400 homes have been flooded (between 30 and 220 cm of water), forcing families to leave their homes as access is only possible by boat or some 4-wheel drive vehicles. According to Civil Defence reports, around 50 residents have refused to self-evacuate or be evacuated and remain on the roofs of their homes, and approximately 250 are being housed in four collective centres. At the family / individual level, in addition to some medical emergencies and health complications associated with the emergency (injuries, blood pressure issues, etc.), families have reported the loss of household items (furniture, appliances, household goods, bedding, etc.) and sanitation issues such as garbage, waterlogged structures, vermin, vectors. These issues have been exacerbated by the meteorological conditions that are typical for this time of year, such as mean temperatures above 24? C (with highs above 32? C), high humidity, unstable weather conditions and the pre-existing pollution of the Pergamino Stream. In addition to partial structural damage to dwellings and some public buildings (Primary Health Care Centres [CAPS] in G?emes and José Hernández neighbourhoods), the blocks adjacent to the Pergamino Stream have large amounts of accumulated debris and waste, which have been hard to remove because of the difficulty in accessing these streets. While the city does have a Local Response Plan, it failed to fully anticipate the storm's effects, catching a great number of families by surprise in their homes. On 25 December, the city formally declared a state alert, including a health alert, due to the level of impact suffered. In Cordoba Province, the strong storm that hit the area on 26 December caused damage to electrical and water services and forced 100 people to evacuate in Jovita. Twelve homes were damaged by hail, and electrical services were interrupted in La Cumbre and in La Falda due to high winds that damaged lamp posts. Six neighbourhoods suffered damage in Villa Dolores, 50 people had to self-evacuate and there were blocked roads and fallen lamp posts; additionally, the storm interrupted electrical and water services in Villa Giardini, Rio Ceballos, Salsipuedes, Agua de Oro, Jesús María and Colonia Caroya. More than 200 people in Santa Fe Province were forced to evacuate. The cities of Rosario and Alvarez were the most affected, as overflowing channels left half of the city cut off and hindered the evacuation efforts. Provincial authorities reported up to one metre of water in dwellings, including the Volunteer Fire Department facilities, which had to be evacuated as well.

Farming communities in marginal agricultural areas continue to have typically low income due to the recent below average agricultural season.

In parts of Kilifi, Garissa, Lamu, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Makueni, Kajiado, Narok and Marsabit there are now significant shortages of pasture and water, and in some cases livestock mortality.

In addition to its effects on food security, the situation has resulted in water shortages and directly affected the livelihoods of thousands of people, especially rural and agriculture-dependent populations. Some communities that are experiencing sporadic rainfall are able to replant short-duration crops (as part of the second cropping period). However, the effects of El Niño are largely affecting communities that are more reliant on livestock and single-season farming. The loss of livestock for many translates to the loss of their ?banked? wealth and will have an impact on the ability of such households to send their children to school and to pay other household expenses. Since livestock is also used for tilling the land, loss in livestock will make it harder for farmers to prepare their land for replanting.  "
